Prior research into expatriate adjustment was used as the study&#8217;s basis and a model for analysis was developed from that research literature. Although some aspects of the relationships found with expatriate employees were not demonstrated, generally the similarities were strong and the features of an expatriate employee&#8217;s experience and that of an international student were seen to be very alike. Over 500 international students completed a survey based on well-validated measures from the research literature. The results were analysed using structural equation modelling. The hypothesised model did not fit very well in its original form and alternative models were suggested and tested in order to identify a better-fitting model. Cultural novelty, personal abilities in interpersonal interactions and communication skills, self-esteem, self-efficacy and general adjustment were found to be the most significant variables in explaining the outcomes of academic achievement, workrelated and general wellbeing and work-related and general satisfaction, with selfesteem, self-efficacy and general adjustment having the greatest influence on successful outcomes. Adjustment was found not to be a mediating construct, as suggested in the expatriate literature, but an antecedent influence upon the outcomes. Relationships between the constructs were complex, as had been suggested by previous research, making generalisations about causes and consequences of adjustment very difficult. This complexity emphasised that, for international students, the experience of living and working in an international location needs to be regarded in a holistic fashion and that there are many and varied contributors to its success. Several potentially fruitful avenues for future research, concerning both international students and expatriate employees, were identified and discussed. The implications of the present study were considered, both from an academic perspective and in terms of usefulness within a university. A number of possible practical strategies were suggested, relevant to students, lecturers and university administrators that might assist in improving the experience of &#8216;expatriation&#8217; for international students.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Students, Foreign -- Western Australia -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Student adjustment -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The independent effects of purified EPA and DHA supplementation on cardiovascular risk in treated-hypertensive type 2 diabetic individuals</field><field name="creator">Woodman, Richard John</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the Abtract for an accurate reproduction.]  Type 2 diabetes at least doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease. This can partly be explained by the increased prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. However, the underlying abnormality of insulin resistance and the presence of more recently identified risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, increased inflammation, and increased oxidative stress might also contribute towards the heightened cardiovascular risk. Fish oil, which contains eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), has wide-ranging beneficial effects on these and other abnormalities, and has reduced cardiovascular mortality in secondary prevention studies. Animal and human studies have recently established that in addition to EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) also has beneficial effects, and furthermore, may have less detrimental effects than EPA on glycaemic control which has worsened in some fish and fish oil studies involving Type 2 diabetic subjects.  Study 1 : This intervention study aimed to determine the independent effects of EPA and DHA on cardiovascular risk factors and glycaemic control in individuals with Type 2 diabetes receiving treatment for hypertension. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of parallel design, 59 subjects in good to moderate glycaemic control (HbA1c &lt; 9%) were recruited from media advertising and randomised to 4 g/day of EPA, DHA or olive oil (placebo) for 6 weeks. Thirty-nine men and 12 post-menopausal women aged 61.2&#177;1.2 yrs completed the study. Relative to placebo, and with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons, serum triglycerides fell by 19% (p=0.022) and 15% (p=0.022) in the EPA and DHA groups respectively. There were no changes in serum total cholesterol, or LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, although HDL2-cholesterol increased 16% with EPA (p=0.026) and 12% with DHA (p=0.05). HDL3-cholesterol fell by 11% (p=0.026) with EPA supplementation and LDL particle size increased by 0.26&#177;0.10 nm (p=0.02) with DHA. Urinary F2-isoprostanes, an in-vivo marker of oxidative stress was reduced by 19% following EPA (p=0.034) and by 20% following DHA. DHA but not EPA supplementation reduced collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation (16.9%, p=0.05) and thromboxane release (18.8%, p=0.03), but there were no significant changes in PAF-stimulated platelet aggregation. Fasting glucose rose by 1.40&#177;0.29 mmol/l (p=0.002) following EPA and 0.98&#177;0.29 mmol/l (p=0.002) following DHA. Neither EPA nor DHA had any significant effect on HbA1c, fasting serum insulin or C-peptide, insulin sensitivity, stimulated insulin secretion, 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate, markers of inflammation, and fibrinolytic or vascular function.  Study 2 : This study aimed to examine the influence and causes of increased inflammation on vascular function in subjects recruited for Study 1. Compared with healthy controls (n=17), the diabetic subjects (n=29) had impaired flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) (3.9&#177;3.0% vs 5.5&#177;2.4%, p=0.07) and glyceryl-trinitrate mediated dilatation (GTNMD) (11.4&#177;4.8% vs 15.4&#177;7.1%, p=0.04) of the brachial artery. They also had higher levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (2.7&#177;2.6 mg/l vs 1.4&#177;1.1 mg/l, p=0.03), fibrinogen (3.4&#177;0.7 g/l vs 2.7&#177;0.3 g/l, p&lt;0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (20.9&#177;13.4 pg/l vs 2.5&#177;1.7 pg/l, p&lt;0.001). In diabetic subjects, after adjustment for age and gender, leukocyte count was an independent predictor of FMD (p=0.02), accounting for 17% of total variance. Similarly, leukocyte count accounted for 23% (p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 for 12% (p=0.03) of variance in GTNMD. Von Willebrand factor, a marker of endothelial cell activation was correlated with leukocyte count (r=0.38, p=0.04), FMD (r=-0.35, p=0.06) and GTNMD (r=-0.47, p=0.009), whilst P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation was correlated with fibrinogen (r=0.58, p=0.001).  Conclusion : EPA and DHA have similar beneficial effects on triglycerides, HDL2 cholesterol and oxidative stress in individuals with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, DHA also increases LDL particle size and reduces collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation and thromboxane release, thus offering more potential than EPA as an anti-thrombotic agent. The beneficial effects of both oils were potentially offset by deterioration in glycaemic control. Neither oil affected blood pressure or vascular function. Longer-term studies with major morbidity and mortality as the primary outcome measures are required to assess the overall benefits and risks of EPA and DHA. The cross-sectional observations from Study 2 are consistent with the hypothesis that impaired vascular function in individuals with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension is at least in part secondary to increased inflammation, with associated endothelial and platelet activation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Diabetic angiopathies -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Hypertension -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Eicosapentaenoic acid -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Docosahexaenoic acid -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">EPA</field><field name="subject">DHA</field><field name="subject">Fish oil</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling dynamical systems via behaviour criteria</field><field name="creator">Kilminster, Devin</field><field name="description">An important part of the study of dynamical systems is the fitting of models to time-series data. That is, given the data, a series of observations taken from a (not fully understood) system of interest, we would like to specify a model, a mathematical system which generates a sequence of &#8220;simulated&#8221; observations. Our aim is to obtain a &#8220;good&#8221; model &#8212; one that is in agreement with the data. We would like this agreement to be quantitative &#8212; not merely qualitative. The major subject of this thesis is the question of what good quantitative agreement means. Most approaches to this question could be described as &#8220;predictionist&#8221;. In the predictionist approach one builds models by attempting to answer the question, &#8220;given that the system is now here, where will it be next?&#8221; The quality of the model is judged by the degree to which the states of the model and the original system agree in the near future, conditioned on the present state of the model agreeing with that of the original system. Equivalently, the model is judged on its ability to make good short-term predictions on the original system. The main claim of this thesis is that prediction is often not the most appropriate criterion to apply when fitting models. We show, for example, that one can have models that, while able to make good predictions, have long term (or free-running) behaviour bearing little resemblance to that exhibited in the original time-series. We would hope to be able to use our models for a wide range of purposes other than just prediction &#8212; certainly we would like our models to exhibit good free-running behaviour. This thesis advocates a &#8220;behaviourist&#8221; approach, in which the criterion for a good model is that its long-term behaviour matches that exhibited by the data. We suggest that the behaviourist approach enjoys a certain robustness over the predictionist approaches. We show that good predictors can often be very poorly behaved, and suggest that well behaved models cannot perform too badly at the task of prediction. The thesis begins by comparing the predictionist and behaviourist approaches in the context of a number of simplified model-building problems. It then presents a simple theory for the understanding of the differences between the two approaches. Effective methods for the construction of well-behaved models are presented. Finally, these methods are applied to two real-world problems &#8212; modelling of the response of a voltage-clamped squid &#8220;giant&#8221; axon, and modelling of the &#8220;yearly sunspot number&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time-series analysis</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Dynamical systems</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear dynamics</field><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterizing intracellular signaling mechanisms involved in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and failure : involvement of JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways</field><field name="creator">Ng, Dominic Chi Hiung</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The innate ability of the heart to compensate for an increase in workload as a result of disease or injury, through an increase in size and mass is known as cardiac hypertrophy. The hypertrophy of the heart compensates for an increase in workload with an increase in cardiac output. However, excessive hypertrophy can result in cardiac dysfunction and substantially increases the risk of cardiac failure and mortality. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac failure are not entirely understood. Traditionally, the G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and the downstream Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) family of proteins have been implicated. However, elevated circulating and ventricular levels of several classes of cytokines also suggested that signaling by the downstream effectors of cytokine receptors, such as the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), may be important. The aim of this thesis was, therefore, to characterize the involvement of MAPK and STAT pathways in regulating cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac failure. A function for MAPK and STAT signaling in regulating cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by the inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#914; was initially defined in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. In this study, it was demonstrated that the chemical inhibition of ERK or p38MAPK was sufficient to inhibit IL-1&#914;-stimulated ANF expression. In contrast, simultaneous inhibition of both ERK and p38MAPK was required to ablate the hypertrophic morphology of cardiac myocytes treated with IL-1&#914;. These results demonstrated differential signaling from the MAPK isoforms in regulating the gene expression and morphological components of cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, it was revealed that IL-1&#914; treatment resulted in a delayed response (&gt;60 min) in STAT3&#945; tyrosine phosphorylation, which was subsequently shown to require the initial rapid activation of either ERK or p38MAPK. IL-1&#914;-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation was also dependent on the de novo synthesis of secondary signaling molecules. The ablation of the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by the inhibition of ERK or p38MAPK activity, correlated with the attenuation of IL-1&#914;-stimulated ANF expression, suggesting that signaling through STAT3&#945; may be involved in regulating gene expression associated with IL-1&#914; cardiac hypertrophy</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart -- Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Heart failure</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Intracellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">Cardiac myocytes</field><field name="subject">JAK/STAT</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical segmentation of mammograms based on pixel intensity</field><field name="creator">Masek, Martin</field><field name="description">Mammography is currently used to screen women in targeted risk classes for breast cancer. Computer assisted diagnosis of mammograms attempts to lower the workload on radiologists by either automating some of their tasks or acting as a second reader. The task of mammogram segmentation based on pixel intensity is addressed in this thesis. The mammographic process leads to images where intensity in the image is related to the composition of tissue in the breast; it is therefore possible to segment a mammogram into several regions using a combination of global thresholds, local thresholds and higher-level information based on the intensity histogram. A hierarchical view is taken of the segmentation process, with a series of steps that feed into each other. Methods are presented for segmentation of: 1. image background regions; 2. skin-air interface; 3. pectoral muscle; and 4. segmentation of the database by classification of mammograms into tissue types and determining a similarity measure between mammograms. All methods are automatic. After a detailed analysis of minimum cross-entropy thresholding, multi-level thresholding is used to segment the main breast tissue from the background. Scanning artefacts and high intensity noise are separated from the breast tissue using binary image operations, rectangular labels are identified from the binary image by their shape, the Radon transform is used to locate the edges of tape artefacts, and a filter is used to locate vertical running roller scratching. Orientation of the image is determined using the shape of the breast and properties of the breast tissue near the breast edge. Unlike most existing orientation algorithms, which only distinguish between left facing or right facing breasts, the algorithm developed determines orientation for images flipped upside down or rotated onto their side and works successfully on all images of the testing database. Orientation is an integral part of the segmentation process, as skin-air interface and pectoral muscle extraction rely on it. A novel way to view the skin-line on the mammogram is as two sets of functions, one set with the x-axis along the rows, and the other with the x-axis along the columns. Using this view, a local thresholding algorithm, and a more sophisticated optimisation based algorithm are presented. Using fitted polynomials along the skin-air interface, the error between polynomial and breast boundary extracted by a threshold is minimised by optimising the threshold and the degree of the polynomial. The final fitted line exhibits the inherent smoothness of the polynomial and provides a more accurate estimate of the skin-line when compared to another established technique. The edge of the pectoral muscle is a boundary between two relatively homogenous regions. A new algorithm is developed to obtain a threshold to separate adjacent regions distinguishable by intensity. Taking several local windows containing different proportions of the two regions, the threshold is found by examining the behaviour of either the median intensity or a modified cross-entropy intensity as the proportion changes. Image orientation is used to anchor the window corner in the pectoral muscle corner of the image and straight-line fitting is used to generate a more accurate result from the final threshold. An algorithm is also presented to evaluate the accuracy of different pectoral edge estimates. Identification of the image background and the pectoral muscle allows the breast tissue to be isolated in the mammogram. The density and pattern of the breast tissue is correlated with 1. Breast cancer risk, and 2. Difficulty of reading for the radiologist. Computerised density assessment methods have in the past been feature-based, a number of features extracted from the tissue or its histogram and used as input into a classifier. Here, histogram distance measures have been used to classify mammograms into density types, and ii also to order the image database according to image similarity. The advantage of histogram distance measures is that they are less reliant on the accuracy of segmentation and the quality of extracted features, as the whole histogram is used to determine distance, rather than quantifying it into a set of features. Existing histogram distance measures have been applied, and a new histogram distance presented, showing higher accuracy than other such measures, and also better performance than an established feature-based technique.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Radiography</field><field name="subject">Radiography, Medical -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Image analysis</field><field name="subject">Mammogram</field><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanisms underlying normal spike activity of the primary afferent synapse in the cochlea and its dysfunction : an investigation of the possible mechanisms of peripheral tinnitus and auditory neuropathy</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Catherine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] One of the problems in researching tinnitus is that it has often been assumed that the physiological mechanisms underlying the tinnitus percept cannot be objectively measured. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that the percept results from altered spontaneous neural activity at some site along the auditory pathway, although it is still debated whether it is produced by: synchronisation of activity of adjacent neurones; a change in the temporal pattern of activity of individual neurones; or an increase in the spontaneous firing rate per se. Similarly, it is possible that the recently coined &#8220;auditory neuropathy&#8221; is produced by under-firing of the primary afferent synapse, although several other mechanisms can also produce the symptoms described by this disorder (normal cochlear mechanical function but absent, or abnormal, synchronous neural firing arising from the cochlea and auditory brainstem, known as the auditory brainstem response, or ABR). Despite an absent ABR, some subjects can detect pure tones at near-normal levels, although their ability to integrate complex sounds, such as speech, is severely degraded in comparison with the pure-tone audiogram. The aim of the following study was to investigate the normal mechanisms underlying neural firing at the primary afferent synapse, and its regulation, to determine the possible mechanisms underlying over-firing (tinnitus) or under-firing (auditory neuropathy) of primary afferent neurones.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tinnitus</field><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Afferent pathways -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Synapses</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An event related potential (ERP) study of symptomatic and asymptomatic adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</field><field name="creator">Krupenia, Stas Simon</field><field name="description">This study recorded Event Related Potentials (ERPs) during completion of a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in order to identify the contribution of response inhibition, working memory, and response monitoring to the pattern of hyperactive and impulsive and inattentive behaviour observed in patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). Four ERP components, Nogo N2, Nogo P3, Go P3, and the ERN were examined and compared using a symptomatic and asymptomatic ADHD sample, and a healthy control group. The Nogo N2 had the expected frontal scalp distribution and was affected by changes to inhibitory demands. It was also suggested that this component was not wholly determined by inhibitory processing and may have been influenced by differing presentation rates of the Go stimulus, a template matching process or an in-depth response strategy. Source localisation analysis suggested a right frontal generator for this component. The Nogo P3 had the expected central distribution and had equal amplitude for those participants that were more efficient at inhibiting behaviours compared to those participants that were less efficient inhibitors. Contrary to expectations, the Nogo P3 was not affected by increasing the inhibitory demands of the task and was suggested as being a less reliable indicator of response inhibition in the present study. The Go P3 had the expected centro-parietal distribution, and appeared to provide a reliable index of working memory. Response inhibition and working memory were not impaired in the sample of symptomatic and asymptomatic ADHD adults used in this study. The symptomatic group elicited a slightly enhanced ERN compared to the asymptomatic and control groups, indicating that deficits in response monitoring may contribute to the pattern of problematic behaviour observed in people with ADHD.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention-deficit disorder in adults</field><field name="subject">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">Event related potentials</field><field name="subject">ADHD</field><field name="subject">ERP</field><field name="subject">Electrical source analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of lactate measurement in the prediction of fetal hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury during labour</field><field name="creator">Pennell, Craig Edward</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  In this thesis the role of lactate measurement has been evaluated in intrapartum assessment of fetal wellbeing. Specifically, I have addressed the question of whether fetal lactate measurement is better than the assessment of fetal heart rate patterns or the measurement of pH at predicting fetal brain injury after intrapartum asphyxia. Using an ovine model of repeated umbilical cord occlusion designed to mimic events which may occur during human labour, I have shown that the measurement of fetal lactate levels after repeated cord occlusion is significantly associated with the severity of brain injury after the asphyxial insult. No significant associations were identified with fetal pH measurements or with the duration of decelerative or compound fetal heart rate patterns; however, this is the first study to describe an association between the duration of both increased fetal heart rate variability and fetal heart rate overshoot with the severity of subsequent brain injury. Although no significant association was identified between fetal arterial pressure measured between umbilical cord occlusions and the grade of brain injury, the studies performed in this thesis are the first to show a strong correlation between the duration of specific arterial pressure responses during cord occlusions and the grade of brain injury, accounting for approximately 90% of the variability seen in the severity of injury. The mechanism responsible for the improved ability of lactate measurement to predict fetal brain injury is unknown. It may be because fetal lactate levels are a more stable marker of anaerobic metabolism of glucose than fetal pH levels, which are influenced by both increasing levels of carbon dioxide and anaerobic metabolism of amino-acids and fatty acids. In addition fetal pH levels can be rapidly normalised through placental exchange of carbon dioxide whereas fetal lactate levels are slow to normalise across the placenta as they rely on facilitated diffusion.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood lactate</field><field name="subject">Fetal monitoring</field><field name="subject">Asphyxia neonatorum</field><field name="subject">Fetal anoxia</field><field name="subject">Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Lactate</field><field name="subject">Labour</field><field name="subject">Prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of saccades on visual sensitivity and time perception</field><field name="creator">Diamond, Mark R.</field><field name="description">Considerable evidence indicates that visual sensitivity is reduced during saccadic eye movement. A central question has been whether saccadic suppression results from a non-visual central signal, or whether the obligate image motion that accompanies saccades is itself sufficient to mask vision. In the first of a series of experiments described here, the visual and non-visual effects of saccades were distinguished by measuring contrast sensitivity to luminance modulated low spatial frequency gratings, at 17 cd&#183;m&#175;&#178; and 0.17 cd&#183;m&#175;&#178;, in saccade conditions and in conditions in which saccade-like image motion was produced by the rotation of a mirror but when observers&#8217; eyes were kept still. The time course of suppression was examined by making measurements from well before image motion began until well after it had ended. A tenfold decrease in contrast sensitivity was found for luminance-modulated gratings with saccades, but little suppression was found with simulated saccades. Adding high contrast noise to the visual display increased the magnitude and the duration of the suppression during simulated saccades but had little effect on suppression produced by real saccades. At lower luminance, suppression was found to be reduced, and its course shallower than at higher luminance. Simulated saccades produced shallower suppression over a longer time course at both higher and lower luminance. In a second experiment the time course of contrast sensitivity to chromatically modulated gratings, at 17 cd&#183;m&#175;&#178;, was examined. No suppression was found; rather there was some evidence of an enhancement of sensitivity, both before and after saccades, relative to fixation conditions. Differences in the effects of real and simulated saccades in the magnitude and time course of sensitivity loss with luminance modulated gratings suggest that saccadic suppression has an extraretinal component that acts on the magnocellular system; the pattern of enhancement found in the later experiment suggests a selective favouring of the parvocellular system both immediately prior to and immediately after saccades. The possibility that the degree of enhancement in sensitivity varies across the visual field was examined using spatially localized stimuli (either high spatial frequency chromatically modulated gratings or letter combinations). Sensitivity was found to decrease at the initial fixation point during the 75 ms prior to saccadic onset and simultaneously to improve at the saccadic target. In the immediate post-saccadic period, sensitivity at the saccadic target was found to exceed that which had been manifest at the initial fixation point prior to saccades, suggesting that post-saccadic enhancement may improve the temporal contrast between one fixation and the next. The final experiments investigated the possibility that our sense of continuity across saccades (as opposed to stability) is influenced by saccade-induced errors in locating events in time. The results of these experiments suggest that saccades can result in errors in judging (a) the time at which external events occur relative to saccadic onset, (b) the temporal order of visual events, and (c) the magnitude of temporal intervals. It is concluded that apparent time is generally foreshortened prior to saccades. This might be due to selective suppression of magnocellular activity and might function to hide saccades and their effects from our awareness. A speculative synthesis is presented based on the idea that recurrent feedback between the neocortical and cortical structures on the one hand, and the thalamic nuclei on the other, has special importance for perception around the time of saccades</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccadic eye movements</field><field name="subject">Contrast sensitivity (Vision)</field><field name="subject">Saccades</field><field name="subject">Saccadic suppression</field><field name="subject">Corollary discharge</field><field name="subject">Image motion</field><field name="subject">Time perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The inequality in infant mortality in Indonesia : evidence-based information and its policy implications</field><field name="creator">Poerwanto, Siswo</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The aims of the study were twofold; firstly, to describe the inequality in infant mortality in Indonesia namely, to look at the extent and magnitude of the problem in terms of the estimated number of infant deaths, the differentials in infant mortality rates, the probability of infant deaths across provinces, urban and rural areas, and across regions of Indonesia. Secondly, to examine the effect of family welfare status and maternal educational levels on the probability of infant deaths. The study design was that of a population-based multistage stratified survey of the 1997 Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey. Results of the study were obtained from a sample of 28,810 reproductive women aged 15 to 49 years who belonged to 34,255 households. A binary outcome variable was selected, namely, whether or not each of the live born infant(s) from the interviewed women was alive or dead prior to reaching one year of age. Of interest were the variables related to socio-economic status, measured by Family Welfare Status Index and maternal educational levels. The following risk factors were also investigated: current contraceptive methods; birth intervals; maternal age at first birth; marital duration; infants&#8217; size perceived by the mothers; infants&#8217; birth weight; marital status; prenatal care by health personnel; antenatal TT immunization; place of delivery; and religion. Geographical strata (province) and residence (urban and rural areas) were also considered. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses were undertaken. Descriptive analysis was aimed at obtaining non-biased estimates of the infant mortality rates at the appropriate levels of aggregation. Multivariate analysis involved a logistic regression model using the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model-fitting technique. The procedure, a multilog-cumlogit , uses the Taylor Series Linearization methods to compute modelbased variance, and which adjusts for the complex sampling design. Results of descriptive analysis indicate that, indeed, there are inequalities in infant mortality across administrative divisions of the country, represented by provinces and regions, as well as across residential areas, namely urban and rural areas. Also, the results suggested that there is socio-economic inequality in infant mortality, as indicated by a dose-response effect across strata of family welfare and maternal educational levels, both individually and interactively. These inequalities varied by residence (urban and rural), provinces and regions (Java Bali, Outer Java Bali I and Outer Java Bali II).

Please see the pdf version for an accurate reproduction.]  This thesis examines the water use, ecophysiology and hydraulic architecture of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) growing on bauxite mine rehabilitation sites in the jarrah forest of south-western Australia. The principal objective was to characterise the key environment and plant-based influences on tree water use, and to better understand the dynamics of water use over a range of spatial and temporal scales in this drought-prone ecosystem. A novel sap flow measurement system (based on the use of the heat pulse method) was developed so that a large number of trees could be monitored concurrently in the field. A validation experiment using potted jarrah saplings showed that rates of sap flow (transpiration) obtained using this system agreed with those obtained gravimetrically. Notably, diurnal patterns of transpiration were measured accurately and with precision using the newly developed heat ratio method. Field studies showed that water stress and water use by jarrah saplings on rehabilitation sites were strongly seasonal: being greatest in summer when it was warm and dry, and least in winter when it was cool and wet. At different times, water use was influenced by soil water availability, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and plant hydraulic conductance. In some areas, there was evidence of a rapid decline in transpiration in response to dry soil conditions. At the end of summer, most saplings on rehabilitation sites were not water stressed, whereas water status in the forest was poor for small saplings but improved with increasing size. It has been recognised that mature jarrah trees avoid drought by having deep root systems, however, it appears that saplings on rehabilitation sites may have not yet developed functional deep roots, and as such, they may be heavily reliant on moisture stored in surface soil horizons. Simple predictive models of tree water use revealed that stand water use was 74 % of annual rainfall at a high density (leaf area index, LAI = 3.1), high rainfall (1200 mm yr-1) site, and 12 % of rainfall at a low density (LAI = 0.4), low rainfall (600 mm yr-1) site, and that water use increased with stand growth. A controlled field experiment confirmed that: (1) sapling transpiration was restricted as root-zone water availability declined, irrespective of VPD; (2) transpiration was correlated with VPD when water was abundant; and (3) transpiration was limited by soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance when water was abundant and VPD was high (&gt; 2 kPa). Specifically, transpiration was regulated by stomatal conductance. Large stomatal apertures could sustain high transpiration rates, but stomata were sensitive to hydraulic perturbations caused by soil water deficits and/or high evaporative demand. No other physiological mechanisms conferred immediate resistance to drought. Empirical observations were agreeably linked with a current theory suggesting that stomata regulate transpiration and plant water potential in order to prevent hydraulic dysfunction following a reduction in soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance. Moreover, it was clear that plant hydraulic capacity determined the pattern and extent of stomatal regulation. Differences in hydraulic capacity across a gradient in water availability were a reflection of differences in root-to-leaf hydraulic conductance, and were possibly related to differences in xylem structure. Saplings on rehabilitation sites had greater hydraulic conductance (by 50 %) and greater leaf-specific rates of transpiration at the high rainfall site (1.5 kg m-2 day1) than at the low rainfall site (0.8 kg m-2 day1) under near optimal conditions. Also, rehabilitation-grown saplings had significantly greater leaf area, leaf area to sapwood area ratios and hydraulic conductance (by 30-50 %) compared to forest-grown saplings, a strong indication that soils in rehabilitation sites contained more water than soils in the forest. Results suggested that: (1) the hydraulic structure and function of saplings growing under the same climatic conditions was determined by soil water availability; (2) drought reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration by reducing whole-tree hydraulic conductance; and (3) saplings growing on open rehabilitation sites utilised more abundant water, light and nutrients than saplings growing in the forest understorey. These findings support a paradigm that trees evolve hydraulic equipment and physiological characteristics suited to the most efficient use of water from a particular spatial and temporal niche in the soil environment.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jarrah -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Jarrah -- Water requirements -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Plants, Effect of soil moisture on -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Tree water use</field><field name="subject">Sap flow</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic conductance</field><field name="subject">Stomatal conductance</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic architecture</field><field name="subject">Mine rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approximate dynamic programming with adaptive critics and the algebraic perceptron as a fast neural network related to support vector machines</field><field name="creator">Hanselmann, Thomas</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see the pdf version for the complete text.  Also, formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of this abstract for an accurate reproduction.] This thesis treats two aspects of intelligent control: The first part is about long-term optimization by approximating dynamic programming and in the second part a specific class of a fast neural network, related to support vector machines (SVMs), is considered. The first part relates to approximate dynamic programming, especially in the framework of adaptive critic designs (ACDs). Dynamic programming can be used to find an optimal decision or control policy over a long-term period. However, in practice it is difficult, and often impossible, to calculate a dynamic programming solution, due to the 'curse of dimensionality'. The adaptive critic design framework addresses this issue and tries to find a good solution by approximating the dynamic programming process for a stationary environment. In an adaptive critic design there are three modules, the plant or environment to be controlled, a critic to estimate the long-term cost and an action or controller module to produce the decision or control strategy. Even though there have been many publications on the subject over the past two decades, there are some points that have had less attention. While most of the publications address the training of the critic, one of the points that has not received systematic attention is training of the action module.&#185; Normally, training starts with an arbitrary, hopefully stable, decision policy and its long-term cost is then estimated by the critic. Often the critic is a neural network that has to be trained, using a temporal difference and Bellman's principle of optimality. Once the critic network has converged, a policy improvement step is carried out by gradient descent to adjust the parameters of the controller network. Then the critic is retrained again to give the new long-term cost estimate. However, it would be preferable to focus more on extremal policies earlier in the training. Therefore, the Calculus of Variations is investigated to discard the idea of using the Euler equations to train the actor. However, an adaptive critic formulation for a continuous plant with a short-term cost as an integral cost density is made and the chain rule is applied to calculate the total derivative of the short-term cost with respect to the actor weights.  This is different from the discrete systems, usually used in adaptive critics, which are used in conjunction with total ordered derivatives. This idea is then extended to second order derivatives such that Newton's method can be applied to speed up convergence. Based on this, an almost concurrent actor and critic training was proposed. The equations are developed for any non-linear system and short-term cost density function and these were tested on a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setup. With this approach the solution  to the actor and critic weights can be achieved in only a few actor-critic training cycles. Some other, more minor issues, in the adaptive critic framework are investigated, such as the influence of the discounting factor in the Bellman equation on total ordered derivatives, the target interpretation in backpropagation through time as moving and fixed targets, the relation between simultaneous recurrent networks and dynamic programming is stated and a reinterpretation of the recurrent generalized multilayer perceptron (GMLP) as a recurrent generalized finite impulse MLP (GFIR-MLP) is made. Another subject in this area that is investigated, is that of a hybrid dynamical system, characterized as a continuous plant and a set of basic feedback controllers, which are used to control the plant by finding a switching sequence to select one basic controller at a time. The special but important case is considered when the plant is linear but with some uncertainty in the state space and in the observation vector, and a quadratic cost function. This is a form of robust control, where a dynamic programming solution has to be calculated.   &amp;sup1Werbos comments that most treatment of action nets or policies either assume enumerative maximization, which is good only for small problems, except for the games of Backgammon or Go [1], or, gradient-based training. The latter is prone to difficulties with local minima due to the non-convex nature of the cost-to-go function. With incremental methods, such as backpropagation through time, calculus of variations and model-predictive control, the dangers of non-convexity of the cost-to-go function with respect to the control is much less than the with respect to the critic parameters, when the sampling times are small. Therefore, getting the critic right has priority. But with larger sampling times, when the control represents a more complex plan, non-convexity becomes more serious.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Intelligent control systems</field><field name="subject">Adaptive critic designs</field><field name="subject">Approximate dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">Algebraic perception</field><field name="subject">Support vector machines</field><field name="subject">Hybrid dynamical system</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children in families in communities : a modified conceptual framework and an analytic strategy for identifying patterns of factors associated with developmental health outcomes in childhood</field><field name="creator">Kendall, Garth Edward</field><field name="description">Mental health reflects an array of causal influences that span biological, psychological, and social circumstances, with resultant underlying causal pathways to poor mental health outcomes in childhood that are complex. Key features of this complexity are reciprocal interactions between person and environment that take place over time. The core of this thesis seeks to attend to the complexity of development to move the field of developmental health forward toward greater explanation, and more successful prediction and prevention. The focal point of the thesis is the psychosocial determinants of childhood mental health, the resource domain of the developing child, and the interplay between characteristics of the individual child, the family, and the community. The eventual goal is to better understand why and how socioeconomic circumstances impact on developmental health. One component of this thesis focuses on the expansion of extant developmental theory. The other component focuses on the development of an analytic strategy that more appropriately reflects the intricacies of this theoretical expansion. In the process, data are analysed, principally as a heuristic strategy, to illustrate the analytical approach needed to support the theoretical framework. The specification of a bioecological conceptual framework suitable to guide research and policy in developmental health is the first principal objective of the thesis. A critical examination of the resource framework proposed by Brooks-Gunn, Brown, Duncan, and Anderson Moore (1995) reveals it to be centred on family and community resources, but otherwise silent with respect to the physical and psychological resources of the child. The quintessential point of this thesis is that theory in developmental health must be able to account for the contribution individuals make to their own development. A modified resource framework is proposed that acknowledges financial, physical, human, and social capital, within the domains of the individual child, the family, and the community. The second principal objective of the thesis, the development of analytical methods that focus on the individual child and the complexity of data generated by this theoretical approach, is then introduced. Theory and method are thus integrated when comprehensive measures of characteristics in multiple domains across developmental periods are modeled using longitudinal data from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (Newnham, Evans, Michael, Stanley, &amp; Landau, 1993). The mothers of 2,860 children were enrolled at 18 weeks in pregnancy and the children have been followed at birth, one, two, three, five, and eight years of age. Eighty-nine per cent (2,537 /2,860) of families were available for follow-up at eight and 74 per cent (2,126/2,860) of families responded. Extensive demographic, psychological, and developmental data were available for the children and their families and a limited amount of data were available for the communities in which they reside. A measure of mental health morbidity, the Child Behaviour Checklist (Achenbach, 1991), was available for the children at two, five, and eight years of age. In the first instance, dichotomous summary variables are derived for the demographic, psychological, and developmental variables of interest. Variables are then selected for inclusion in one of several explanatory models. To create a mathematical representation of resource characteristics, the information for each child is concatenated as a series of binary strings. Frequency tabulation is then used to aggregate the data and odds ratios are calculated to determine the degree of risk associated with each string of code, or pattern of factors relative to a nominated mental health outcome. The results provided a scaffold from which this theoretical and analytical approach is compared and contrasted with the reviewed literature. Two principal themes of investigation are pursued. The first theme to be examined is the interplay between characteristics of the child, family, and community and the contribution children make to their own development. The specific approach models the interaction between selected characteristics of the child, family and community in each of four developmentally significant time periods. The theoretical position adopted in the present study suggests that the effect of any personal or contextual factor on later development, if a relationship does truly exist, is most likely to be differential. That is, it is a combination of influences that determines developmental outcomes for children, not any single factor acting independently. The modelling process demonstrates that, for the children involved, personal and contextual factors impact mental health differentially depending on various other individual, family and/or community characteristics. The modelling process identifies patterns of factors that impact relatively small, but significant, numbers of children because the models focus on the effect for individual children rather than the effect for the group. For example, one model suggests that the effect of intra-uterine growth restriction for the group as a whole may be minimal, but the impact for some children could be critical depending on the combination of family and community influences, such as the mothers level of education, the family&#8217;s experience of significant life stress, and residence in a relatively disadvantaged community.  The second theme to be examined is the possibility that the accumulation of resource deficits or risk characteristics, over time, amplifies the likelihood of mental health problems in childhood. The approach models selected characteristics of the child in each of the four periods of development collectively, and it also models selected characteristics spanning each of the four time periods discretely. The results suggest that latency, pathway, and recency effects may operate simultaneously, and that timing and accumulated burden may both be important determinants of risk. For example, with regard to children whose family experienced life stress, these three effects operated in a systematic way to increase the degree of risk of a mental health problem. In summary, the aggregation of data at the individual level is a productive approach in seeking to explain population level social phenomena. While seemingly paradoxical, the identification of the joint, interactive effects between individual, family, and community characteristics, better allows for the quantification of family and community characteristics operating through multiple causal pathways.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children -- Mental health -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Developmental psychology -- Western Australia -- Longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Environment and children -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Family -- Western Australia -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Developmental health</field><field name="subject">Childhood mental health</field><field name="subject">Social determinants of health</field><field name="subject">Family and community resource framework</field><field name="subject">Person-oriented analysis</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal birth cohort study</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buckling of suction caissons during installation</field><field name="creator">Pinna, Rodney</field><field name="description">Suction caissons are a foundation system for offshore structures which offer a number of advantages over traditional piled foundations. In particular, due to the method of installation used, they are well suited for deep-water applications. The suction caisson consists of an open ended cylindrical shell, which is installed below the seabed in a sequence which consists of two loading phases. The caisson is first installed part way under self weight, with the installation being completed by lowering the pressure within the cylinder and thus allowing the ambient water pressure to force the caisson into the ground. This thesis examines a number of structural issues which result from the form of the caisson &#8212; essentially a thin walled cylinder &#8212; and the interaction of the caisson with the surrounding soil during installation. To do this, variational analysis and nonlinear finite element analysis are employed to examine the buckling and collapse behaviour of these cylinders. In particular, two issues are considered; the influence of the open end, and the interaction between the cylinder and soil on the buckling and collapse loads. First, the behaviour of open ended cylinders is considered, where the boundary condition at the open end is allowed to vary continuously from completely free to pinned, by the use of a variable lateral spring. This lateral spring restraint may be considered to represent the intermediate restraint provided by a ring stiffener which is not fully effective. The effect of various combinations of boundary conditions is accounted for by the use of a multiplier on the lower bound to the buckling load of a cylinder with classical supports.  The variable spring at the open end may also be considered to be an initial, simple representation of the effect of soil restraint on the buckling load. More complex representations of the soil restraint are also considered. A nondimensional factor is proposed to account for the influence of this spring on the buckling load. One combination of boundary conditions, where the upper end of the caisson is pinned, and the lower end free (referred to as a PF boundary condition), is found to have buckling and collapse behaviour which is unusual for cylindrical shells. Buckling loads for such shells are much lower than would be found for cylinders with more typical boundary conditions, and of similar dimensions. More unusually however, PF cylinders are shown to have positive postbuckling strength. The behaviour is found to be a result of the large flexibility which results from the low restraint provided by the PF boundary conditions. This is shown by continuously decreasing the flexibility of the cylinder, by increasing the axial restraint at the pinned end. It is shown that this results in a large increase in buckling load, and a return to more usual levels of imperfection sensitivity. In particular, with an intermediate level of axial restraint, buckling loads and imperfection sensitivity are intermediate between those of PF shells with no, and with full, axial restraint. Overall however, collapse loads for PF cylinders with no additional restraint are well below those of cylinders with stiffer boundary conditions, for equal geometries. Eigenvalue buckling of cylinders fully and partially embedded in an elastic material are examined, and two analytical solutions are proposed. One of these is an extension of a method previously proposed by Seide (1962), for core filled cylinders, to pin ended cylinders which have support from both a core and a surrounding material. The second method represents the elastic support as a two parameter foundation. While more approximate than the first method, this method allows for the examination of a wider range of boundary conditions, and of partial embedment. It is found that the buckling load of the shell/soil system decreases as the embedment ratio decreases.  Collapse of fully and partially embedded cylinders is also examined, using nonlinear finite element analysis. The influence of plasticity in the soil is also considered. For cylinders with small imperfections, it is found that the collapse load shows a large increase over that of the same cylinder with no soil support. However, as the size of initial geometric imperfections increases, it is found that the collapse load rapidly approaches that of the unsupported cylinder. In particular, in weak soils the gain in strength over the unsupported shell may be minimal. The exception to this is again PF cylinders. As these have relatively low collapse loads, even very weak soils are able to offer an increase in collapse load over the unsupported case. Finally, a summary of these results is provided in the form of guidance for design of such structures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caissons</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Foundations</field><field name="subject">Soil-structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Buckling</field><field name="subject">Collapse</field><field name="subject">Finite Element Analysis</field><field name="subject">Shells</field><field name="subject">Suction caissons</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into wave run-up on vertical surface piercing cylinders in monochromatic waves</field><field name="creator">Morris-Thomas, Michael</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Wave run-up is the vertical uprush of water when an incident wave impinges on a free- surface penetrating body. For large volume offshore structures the wave run-up on the weather side of the supporting columns is particularly important for air-gap design and ultimately the avoidance of pressure impulse loads on the underside of the deck structure. This investigation focuses on the limitations of conventional wave diffraction theory, where the free-surface boundary condition is treated by a Stokes expansion, in predicting the harmonic components of the wave run-up, and the presentation of a simplified procedure for the prediction of wave run-up. The wave run-up is studied on fixed vertical cylinders in plane progressive waves. These progressive waves are of a form suitable for description by Stokes' wave theory whereby the typical energy content of a wave train consists of one fundamental harmonic and corresponding phase locked Fourier components. The choice of monochromatic waves is indicative of ocean environments for large volume structures in the diffraction regime where the assumption of potential flow theory is applicable, or more formally A/a &lt; &#927;(1) (A and a being the wave amplitude and cylinder radius respectively). One of the unique aspects of this work is the investigation of column geometry effects - in terms of square cylinders with rounded edges - on the wave run-up. The rounded edges of each cylinder are described by the dimensionless parameter rc/a which denotes the ratio of edge corner radius to half-width of a typical column with longitudinal axis perpendicular to the quiescent free-surface. An experimental campaign was undertaken where the wave run-up on a fixed column in plane progressive waves was measured with wire probes located close to the cylinder. Based on an appropriate dimensional analysis, the wave environment was represented by a parametric variation of the scattering parameter ka and wave steepness kA (where k denotes the wave number). The effect of column geometry was investigated by varying the edge corner radius ratio within the domain 0 &lt;=rc/a &lt;= 1, where the upper and lower bounds correspond to a circular and square shaped cylinder respectively. The water depth is assumed infinite so that the wave run-up caused purely by wave-structure interaction is examined without the additional influence of a non-decaying horizontal fluid velocity and finite depth effects on wave dispersion. The zero-, first-, second- and third-harmonics of the wave run-up are examined to determine the importance of each with regard to local wave diffraction and incident wave non-linearities. The modulus and phase of these harmonics are compared to corresponding theoretical predictions from conventional diffraction theory to second-order in wave steepness. As a result, a basis is formed for the applicability of a Stokes expansion to the free-surface boundary condition of the diffraction problem, and its limitations in terms of local wave scattering and incident wave non-linearities. An analytical approach is pursued and solved in the long wavelength regime for the interaction of a plane progressive wave with a circular cylinder in an ideal fluid. The classical Stokesian assumption of infinitesimal wave amplitude is invoked to treat the free-surface boundary condition along with an unconventional requirement that the cylinder width is assumed much smaller than the incident wavelength. This additional assumption is justified because critical wavelengths for wave run-up on a fixed cylinder are typically much larger in magnitude than the cylinder's width. In the solution, two coupled perturbation schemes, incorporating a classical Stokes expansion and cylinder slenderness expansion, are invoked and the boundary value problem solved to third-order. The formulation of the diffraction problem in this manner allows for third-harmonic diffraction effects and higher-order effects operating at the first-harmonic to be found. In general, the complete wave run-up is not well accounted for by a second-order Stokes expansion of the free-surface boundary condition and wave elevation. This is however, dependent upon the coupling of ka and kA. In particular, whilst the modulus and phase of the second-harmonic are moderately predicted, the mean set-up is not well predicted by a second-order Stokes expansion scheme. This is thought to be caused by higher than second-order non-linear effects since experimental evidence has revealed higher-order diffraction effects operating at the first-harmonic in waves of moderate to large steepness when k &lt; &lt; 1. These higher-order effects, operating at the first-harmonic, can be partially accounted for by the proposed long wavelength formulation. For small ka and large kA, subsequent comparisons with measured results do indeed provide a better agreement than the classical linear diffraction solution of Havelock (1940). To account for the complete wave run-up, a unique approach has been adopted where a correction is applied to a first-harmonic analytical solution. The remaining non-linear portion is accounted for by two methods. The first method is based on regression analysis in terms of ka and kA and provides an additive correction to the first-harmonic solution. The second method involves an amplification correction of the first-harmonic. This utilises Bernoulli's equation applied at the mean free-surface position where the constant of proportionality is empirically determined and is inversely proportional to ka. The experimental and numerical results suggest that the wave run-up increases as rc/a--&#8250; 0, however this is most significant for short waves and long waves of large steepness. Of the harmonic components, experimental evidence suggests that the effect of a variation in rc/a on the wave run-up is particularly significant for the first-harmonic only. Furthermore, the corner radius effect on the first-harmonic wave run-up is well predicted by numerical calculations using the boundary element method. Given this, the proposed simplified wave run-up model includes an additional geometry correction which accounts for rc/a to first-order in local wave diffraction. From a practical view point, it is the simplified model that is most useful for platform designers to predict the wave run-up on a surface piercing column. It is computationally inexpensive and the comparison of this model with measured results has proved more promising than previously proposed schemes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean waves -- Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Ocean waves -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures -- Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Wave run-up</field><field name="subject">Stokes expansion</field><field name="subject">Water waves</field><field name="subject">Progressive waves</field><field name="subject">Perturbation methods</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and control of Clostridium difficile infection in a Western Australian hospital</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Claudia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The prinicipal aim of this thesis was to explore the relationship between 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotics and hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). This antibiotic class has been implicated in the aetiology of CDAD; therefore restriction of these antibiotics via antibiotic policies represents a potential strategy for prevention and control of CDAD. Successful control of CDAD in hospitals translates to improved quality of care for patients, and a reduction of pressure on hospital resources. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine whether 3rd generation cephalosporins were related to CDAD, to evaluate the effect of changes to antibiotic policy on the incidence of CDAD, and to determine the impact of CDAD on patient length of stay and hospital costs. The study was conducted in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH), a public teaching hospital located in Perth, the capital city of the state of Western Australia. Evidence for an association between 3rd generation cephalosporins and CDAD was obtained from studies of ecologic- and individual-level data. A time series analysis of the relationship between monthly consumption of 3rd generation cephalosporins and the incidence of CDAD in SCGH was undertaken covering the period 1994 to 2000. The results demonstrated a positive relationship between the use of 3rd generation cephalosporins and CDAD. A matched case-control study that involved 193 adult inpatients diagnosed with CDAD and 386 adult inpatients without CDAD, selected from the period 1996 to 2000, was conducted. Information was collected on exposure to 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotics during hospitalisation, as well as exposure to other antibiotics and medications, procedures, and comorbidities. Results from conditional logistic regression analyses found CDAD cases were six times more likely to be exposed to 3rd generation cephalosporins during their admission, prior to the onset of diarrhoea, than controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.56-24.37). Approximately one third of CDAD in the study population could be attributed to 3rd generation cephalosporins. CDAD cases were also four times more likely to have been exposed to either amoxicillin-clavulanate or ticarcillin-clavulanate (adjusted OR=4.23, 95% CI=1.81-9.93).  In October 1998, an antibiotic policy was introduced at SCGH that restricted the use of ceftriaxone, the 3rd generation cephalosporin most commonly used by the hospital. During 1999 and 2000, the incidence of CDAD halved as ceftriaxone consumption fell in response to this policy. The effect of this policy was demonstrated in the time series model; during the post-policy period the relationship between ceftriaxone and CDAD that was evident prior to the policy was cancelled out. From the individual-level data, obtained from the case-control study, a reduction in the prevalence of exposure to 3rd generation cephalosporins from 11% to 1% accounted for a 30% reduction in the incidence of CDAD. Data from the case-control study was also used to analyse the independent contribution of CDAD to length of stay and admission costs using multiple linear regression</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clostridium difficile -- Western Australia -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Clostridium difficile -- Western Australia -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Nosocomial infections -- Western Australia -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Cephalosporins -- Side effects</field><field name="subject">Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea</field><field name="subject">Hospital infection</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic policy</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Disease control</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the efficacy of a program developed to optimise the physiotherapist-patient interaction</field><field name="creator">Potter, Margaret J.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This PhD project was comprised of three major studies. Study 1 utilised the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to identify a typology of difficult patients in private practice physiotherapy and to determine strategies physiotherapists use and would like to improve, when dealing with such patients. Physiotherapists (n=37) also shared their expectations of patients and their perceptions of patient expectations of physiotherapy. Results showed that the two areas most difficult to manage were behavioural problems of patients followed by patient expectations. To assist in their interaction with difficult patients, physiotherapists identified communication skills and behaviour modification techniques as strategies they would most like to learn. While physiotherapists expressed the greatest number of expectations in the behavioural domain, identification of patient expectations was not elicited as a strategy to manage difficult patients. Results of this qualitative study contribute to the evolving literature relating to physiotherapist-patient interactions and form a useful basis for educational programs directed at improving the therapeutic relationship in private practice physiotherapy. Study 2 involved applying the NGT with separate groups of patients (n=26) to identify patient expectations of the qualities of a &#8216;good&#8217; physiotherapist, and to ascertain the characteristics of good and bad experiences in private practice physiotherapy. Findings indicated that the qualities of a &#8216;good&#8217; physiotherapist related to their communication ability, professional behaviour and organisational ability, and characteristics of the service provided. The most important expectations of patients were for example, symptomatic relief, self-management strategies and &#8216;hands on&#8217; treatment; associated with the physical domain. When comparing equivalent groups from Study 1, with patient expectations, most patient groups identified that the most important expectations of physiotherapists would relate to patient behaviours such as; compliance, honesty, payment of their account, being punctual, cooperating, trusting and showing respect for their physiotherapist. However, physiotherapists&#8217; rankings of the most important expectations held by patients were not congruent with patient rankings providing an explanation as to why problems may arise in the physiotherapistpatient interaction from the patient&#8217;s perspective. Based on the findings of Study 2 it was suggested that physiotherapists should actively seek to involve patients in their management. To do this effectively, physiotherapists would benefit from further training in communication skills to ensure that they can successfully adopt a patientcentred approach and to optimise the physiotherapist-patient interaction in private practice physiotherapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical therapist and patient</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapist-patient interaction</field><field name="subject">Communication skills training</field><field name="subject">Difficult patient</field><field name="subject">Patient experience</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mycorrhizal association, propagation and conservation of the myco-heterotrophic orchid Rhizanthella gardneri</field><field name="creator">Mursidawati, Sofi</field><field name="description">Many orchids require mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi for their development and survival. Rhizanthella gardneri the Western Australian underground orchid is associated with the companion plant Melaleuca uncinata and its ectomycorrhizal fungus symbiont. Much less is known about the habitat requirements of its sister species, R. slateri, which occurs in Eastern Australia. The absence of chlorophyll from Rhizanthella gardneri and R. slateri results in total dependency on associations with fungal symbionts. Many ecological and biological aspects of these fascinating orchids remained poorly known, including the identity of the fungal associates and the nature of their tripartite associations with Rhizanthella and Melaleuca. Extremely high specificity of these mycorrhizal relationships is likely to be the most important factor explaining the highly specific habitat requirements of underground orchids. The purpose of this study was to conduct further investigations of the role of the mycorrhizal associations of Australian underground orchids by identifying the fungi involved in these associations, optimising their growth in sterile culture and devising efficient means for synthesising their tripartite associations with R. gardneri and M. uncinata. In total, 16 isolates of fungi were successfully obtained from the two underground orchids and used in a series of experiments to understand both the nature of the fungi and their relationship with orchids. The identity of these fungi was established by using conventional morphological and molecular methods. Cultural and morphological studies revealed that all isolates from R. gardneri and R. slateri were binucleate rhizoctonias with affinities to members of the genus Ceratobasidium. However, the teleomorph state that was observed from the R. slateri symbiont during this study more closely resembled a Thanatephorus species. Further identification using ITS sequence comparisons confirmed that mycorrhizal fungi of Rhizanthella belonged to the Rhizoctonia alliance with relatives that include Thanatephorus, Ceratobasidium, or Rhizoctonia from other continents with over 90% similarity. Most of these related fungi are known as plant pathogens, but some were orchid mycorrhizal fungi. However, the isolates from the two underground orchids were most closely related to each other and formed a discrete group relative to other known members of the Rhizoctonia alliance.  Sterile culture experiments determined culture media preferences for mycorrhizal fungi from Rhizanthella and other orchids. A fully defined sterile culture medium designed to more closely resemble Australian soil conditions was formulated. This new medium was compared to undefined media containing oats or yeast extract and recommendations for growth of these fungi are provided. The undefined media based on oats provided the best growth of most fungi, but the new Australian soil media was also effective at growing most orchid mycorrhizal fungi and this fully defined media was less prone to contamination and should provide more reproducible results. A comparison of three methods for inoculating M. uncinata with the underground orchid fungi resulted in the production and characterisation of ectomycorrhizal roots and hyphae formed by fungi isolated from R. gardneri and R. slateri. These underground orchid fungi could easily be distinguished from other mycorrhizal fungi (caused by airborne contamination) by the characteristic appearance of these roots and hyphae. A new system for growing and observing tripartite mycorrhizal associations was devised using pots with side viewing windows and the use of transparent seed packets to contain Rhizanthella seeds. This method allowed all the stages of seed germination to be observed in the glasshouse, culminating in the production of underground orchid rhizomes. Seed germination was only successful when seed was placed directly over active M. uncinata ectomycorrhizas confirmed to belong to the correct fungus by microscopic observations through the side of window pots. The importance of these new scientific discoveries concerning the biology and ecology of the underground orchids and their associated fungi for the recovery of these critically endangered orchids are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri -- Ecophysiology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi -- Western Australia -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Ectomycorrhizas -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of bat-ball impact in baseball</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, Rochelle Louise</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Ball-impact injuries in baseball, while relatively rare, have the potential to be catastrophic. These injuries are primarily attributed to impact by the ball after it has been hit, pitched or thrown. As the closest infielder to the hitter, the pitcher is at greatest risk of being struck by the batted ball. This thesis investigated the influence of bat and ball design on ball exit velocity (BEV) and the potential for impact injury to pitchers. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to quantify the dynamics of bat-ball impact for bats of various moment of inertia and baseballs with different mechanical properties. The analysis was conducted using ANSYS/LSDYNA explicit dynamics software. To replicate a typical bat-ball impact in the field, the model required input of bat linear and angular velocity and orientation in three-dimensional (3-D) space, at the instant prior to impact. This data was obtained from 3-D kinematic analysis using two high-speed video cameras operating at 200 Hz. Seventeen high-performance batters used a wood bat and a metal bat of equal length and mass to hit baseballs thrown by a pitcher. Hitters developed significantly higher resultant linear velocity for both the proximal (38.3 &#177; 1.8 ms-1;) and distal (8.1 &#177; 1.8 ms-1) ends of the metal bat (compared with 36.4 &#177; 1.7 ms-1 and 6.9 &#177; 2.1 ms-1 respectively for the wood bat). They also achieved a significantly more &#8220;square&#8221; bat position just prior to impact with the ball (264.3 &#177; 9.1 deg compared with 251.5 &#177; 10.4 deg). These factors are important in transferring momentum to the batted ball. Mathematical description of the large-deformation material behaviour of the baseball was also required for this analysis. Previous research is limited to compression tests to 10 % of ball diameter, despite conjecture that during impact with the bat, the ball might deform to 50 % of its original diameter. Uniaxial quasi-static compression tests on seven models of baseballs investigated baseball behaviour during deformation to 50 % of ball diameter. The resulting force-displacement relationship was highly non-linear. Hence FEA was used to derive and verify a relationship to describe the time-dependent and elastic behaviour of the ball during the 1 ms period typical of bat-ball impact. The results of the bat-ball impact analysis indicated that for hits made at the point of maximum momentum transfer on the bat, the metal bat produced greater BEV than the wood bat (61.5 ms-1 and 50.9 ms-1 respectively). The higher BEV from the metal bat was attributed to greater pre-impact bat linear velocity, and bat orientation during impact. The more perpendicular horizontal orientation of the metal bat at the instant of impact resulted in a greater proportion of resultant BEV being directed in the global x-direction (toward the pitcher), compared with the wood bat. This indicates increasing bat moment of inertia (the relative mass of the bat barrel) may be a potential control strategy for BEV. BEV was also reduced for impacts using a baseball with values for instantaneous shear and relaxed modulii approximately 33 % less (9.9 % reduction in BEV for metal bat, 9.7 % for the wood bat).</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Baseball bats</field><field name="subject">Baseballs</field><field name="subject">Baseball injuries</field><field name="subject">Impact -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Baseball equipment performance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of bacteriophages of Clostridium difficile</field><field name="creator">Goh, Shan</field><field name="description">Clostridium difficile is an important hospital-acquired pathogen causing C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in patients exposed to antibiotics. The lack of information on bacteriophages of C. difficile, and the potential of phages as therapeutic agents for the treatment of CDAD, prompted the isolation and characterisation of phages active against clinical isolates of C. difficile in order to determine the prevalence and significance of phages of this anaerobe. Three (5.4 %) of 56 clinical C. difficile isolates induced by mitomycin C yielded dsDNA phages C2, C5, C6 and C8. The four phages differed from previously described C. difficile phages in particle morphology, burst size and host range. C2, C5 and C8 particles were members of the family Myoviridae, while C6 belonged to Siphoviridae. The burst sizes were 5 for C2, 7 for C5, 19 for C6 and 33 for C8. C8 had the broadest host range, lysing 27 out of 56 (48 %) C. difficile isolates, followed by C6 (43 %), C5 (20 %) and C2 (20 %). Superinfection experiments, restriction enzyme analysis and Southern hybridisation showed C2 and C5 to be closely related with C8 somewhat related to them, however, C6 was distantly related to the other three phages. C2 was further characterised as a representative phage. Its genome did not possess cohesive ends, and was shown to integrate chromosomally via an attP site identified within a 1.9 kb HindIII fragment. However, an integrase gene, which is typically close to the attP region, was not located. Nine of 16 HindIII fragments of C2, including the 1.9 kb fragment, were cloned into pUC18. Approximately 9 kb of the estimated 43 kb genome of C2 was sequenced and analysed. Seven of the nine translated sequences were homologous to phage structural proteins, two sequences were not homologous to any relevant protein in the Genbank and EMBL databases, and one was homologous to proteins of Clostridium species. Nucleotide homology between the C2 sequences and the recently sequenced C. difficile strain CD630 was found in three regions within CD630 genome. Seven of the nine sequences, including the 1.9 kb fragment, were clustered in one region. These data suggest that the genes constitute a phage structural gene module. The presence of C2-like sequences in CD630, and Southern hybridisation of C. difficile strains using phage probes, suggested related prophage sequences may be commonly present in this bacterial species. An investigation was carried out to determine the presence of toxin genes tcdA and tcdB, and PaLoc-associated gene tcdE, in phage DNA. In addition, the effect of phage infection on toxin production of toxigenic C. difficile strains was studied. Of the three genes, tcdE only was detected in phages C2, C5 and C8, but not in C6. Strains that maintained phages in a stable manner (lysogens) were isolated and used in toxin studies. The amount of toxin B produced was measured by cytotoxic assays using Vero cells, and toxin A production was measured by ELISA. Although phages did not encode toxin A or B genes, there was a significant increase in toxin B production in some lysogens. There was no increase in toxin A production. Transcriptional analyses of tcdA and tcdB in lysogens and parental strains was performed by real-time RT-PCR and Northern hybridisation to determine whether phage was affecting regulation of toxin transcription. Phage did not appear to affect toxin gene transcription, although results from real-time RT-PCR and Northern hybridisation were conflicting. A phage induced from the highly toxigenic reference strain VPI 10463 was also briefly characterised and investigated for its effect on toxin production in VPI 10463. The phage,  &#934;CV, had similar particle morphology to C2, C5 and C8, and had some HindIII bands in common with C2 and C5. Two cured variant strains produced significantly less toxin B compared to VPI 10463. In conclusion, several important properties of C. difficile phages were characterised. It appears these temperate phages may play a role in toxin production making them unsuitable as therapeutic agents for the treatment of CDAD. However, C2 phage may have potential as the basis for an integrative vector that will add to the genetic tools available for clostridia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clostridium difficile</field><field name="subject">Bacteriophages -- Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The validation and use of the rat intestinal epithelial cell line 6 (IEC-6) to study the role of ferroportin1 and divalent metal transporter 1 in the uptake of iron from Fe(II) and Fe(III)</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Carla</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Iron is vital for almost all living organisms by participating in a wide variety of metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, DNA synthesis, and electron transport. However, iron concentrations in body tissues must be tightly regulated because excessive iron leads to tissue damage, as a result of formation of free radicals. In mammals since no controlled means of eliminating unwanted iron has evolved, body iron balance is maintained by alterations in dietary iron intake. This occurs in the duodenum where most dietary iron is absorbed. Absorption involves at least two steps, uptake of iron from the intestinal lumen and then its transport into the body, processes that occur at the apical and basal membranes of enterocytes, respectively. In chapter one of this thesis the background information relevant to iron absorption is described. Despite numerous studies, the role of these proteins in iron absorption remains unclear, partly because many studies have reported them in non-enterocyte cell lines where the expression of the proteins involved in iron absorption is unlikely and therefore the physiological significance of the findings uncertain. Therefore, the study of iron absorption would value from additional cell lines of intestinal origin being used, preferably derived from a species used to comprehensively study this process in vivo, namely the rat. Validation of such a model would enable comparisons to be made from a molecular level to its relevance in the whole organism. In chapter 3 of this thesis, the rat intestinal cell line 6 (IEC-6) was examined as a model of intestinal iron transport. IEC-6 cells expressed many of the proteins involved in iron absorption, but not the ferrireductase Dcytb, sucrase or &#945;v&#946;3 integrin. In addition, in IEC-6 cells the expression of the apical transporter divalent metal  transporter 1 (DMT1), the iron storage protein ferritin, the uptake of Fe(II) and Fe(III) were regulated by cellular iron stores as is seen in vivo. This suggests that IEC-6 cells are of a lower villus enterocyte phenotype. Presented in chapter 4 is the study of the uptake of iron from Fe(II):ascorbate and Fe(III):citrate by IEC-6 cells in the presence of a blocking antibody to the putative basolateral transporter ferroportin1 and of colchicine and vinblastine, different pHs, and over-expression of DMT1. It was shown that optimal Fe(II) uptake required a low extracellular pH and was dependent on DMT1. Uptake of Fe(III) functioned optimally at a neutral pH, did not require surface ferrireduction, and was increased during over-expression of DMT1. These observations suggest that intravesicular ferrireduction takes place before transport of Fe(II) to the cytoplasm by DMT1. This pathway was not blocked by a functional antibody against &#945;v&#946;3 integrin but was inhibited by competition with unlabeled iron citrate or citrate alone. Surprisingly, a functional antibody against ferroportin1 had no effect on efflux but significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05) uptake of Fe(II) by 40-50% and Fe(III) by 90%, indicating two separate pathways for the uptake of iron from Fe(II)-ascorbate and from Fe(III)-citrate in IEC-6 cells. Presented in chapter 5 is the development and validation of a technique for the removal of freshly isolated enterocytes from the rat duodenum and their use to study iron transport processes that enabled comparisons to be made between these cells, IEC-6 cells and the human enterocyte cell line Caco-2 cells. In chapter 6 a blocking antibody to ferroportin1 was shown to inhibit uptake of Fe(II) but not release of iron in freshly isolated duodenal enterocytes from rats and Caco-2 cells supporting the findings obtained with IEC-6 cells described in chapter 4. Fe(II) uptake was reduced only when the antibody was in contact with the apical membrane indicating its expression at the microvillus membrane. Confirming this, ferroportin1 was shown along the microvillus membrane of Caco-2 cells, in enriched microvillus membrane preparations and in enterocytes of duodenum tissue of rats where it co-localised with lactase. The significant findings to emerge from this thesis are that the IEC-6 cell is a valid model to study iron absorption producing results consistent with those found in freshly isolated enterocytes and in human enterocyte-like cells. In particular, ferroportin1 functions in the uptake of iron at the apical membrane possibly by modulating surface binding of Fe(II) to DMT1 or the activity of DMT1. In addition to this in Fe(II) uptake from Fe(III) ferroportin1 may also affect the number of Fe(III): citrate binding sites. Preliminary studies further characterizing the function of ferroportin1 at the apical membrane and at intracellular sites of IEC-6 cells along with integration of these data are discussed in chapter 7.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iron -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Iron -- Physiological transport</field><field name="subject">Intestinal absorption</field><field name="subject">Iron proteins</field><field name="subject">Transferrin -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Rats -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Iron absorption</field><field name="subject">DMT1</field><field name="subject">Ferroportin</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of novel methods for increasing the yield of small round seed potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) varieties Atlantic and Granola</field><field name="creator">Arpiwi, Ni Luh</field><field name="description">Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) varieties Atlantic and Granola are widely grown in Indonesia. The optimal method of cultivation in the tropics, due to the susceptibility of cut seed for disease, is by small (20 to 55 g) whole seed potatoes. However, the variety Atlantic produces mostly large tubers, which are not suitable for planting as whole seeds. Although Granola produces a reasonable proportion of small tubers it still produces a few in the larger size grades and there is no fresh market in Western Australia for the larger tubers for this variety. The aim of this study was to develop methods to be used in Western Australia that improve the yield of small seed potatoes for export to Indonesia. The influence of seed-potato storage duration (at 4&#176;C) on subsequent stem growth was assessed after 30 days growth in a glasshouse (22&#176;C/18&#176;C, day&#8260;night). Seed potato storage for 22-28 (Atlantic) and 24-30 (Granola) weeks resulted in development of higher numbers of stems. A series of field experiment were designed to increase yield of small tubers. Apical sprout removal in Granola, but not Atlantic, increased the number of stems (by 27%), yield of 20-55 g potato (by 32%) and total yield (by 17%). Application of herbicide (paraquat + diquat) at low concentration during early tuber initiation decreased total yield in Atlantic (by 14%) and Granola (by 16%). Treating whole seed potatoes with carvone vapor two weeks before planting had no influence on stem or tuber number in both Atlantic and Granola but in Atlantic only, the total yield was reduced by 12%. Spraying plants with paclobutrazol during early tuber initiation inconsistently influenced tuber number and yield between the two varieties and two experiments. The influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) on stem number, total tuber number, yield of 20-55 g tubers and total yield was investigated by dipping seed pieces in a GA3 solution (20 mg&#8260;L) two days prior to planting. In Atlantic, GA3 treatment increased stem number (by 147%), total tuber number (by 75%) and yield of 20-55 g tubers (by 330%) without influencing total yield. In Granola, GA3 treatment increased stem number (by 50%), total tuber number (by 15%), yield of 20-55 g tubers (by 21%) and total yield (by 10%) The influence of gibberellic acid application (20 mg&#8260;L) to seed pieces before planting increased the number of small tubers through increased stem number. The shift toward a greater proportion of small tubers, without reducing total yield, had a greater influence in Atlantic than that in Granola.

The desire for faster transmission speeds and higher levels of integration, combined with lower signal levels and denser circuit boards has placed greater emphasis on managing problems related to phase noise, timing jitter, and timing distribution. This thesis reports original work on phase noise modelling in electronic systems. A new model is proposed which predicts the up-conversion of baseband noise to the carrier frequency in RF amplifiers. The new model is validated by comparing the predicted phase noise performance to experimental measurements as it applies to a common emitter (CE), bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier. The results show that the proposed model correctly predicts the measured phase noise, including the shaping of the noise about the carrier frequency, and the dependence of phase noise on the amplifier parameters. In addition, new work relating to timing transfer in digital communication systems is presented. A new clock recovery algorithm is proposed for decoding timing information encoded using the synchronous residual time-stamp (SRTS) method. Again, theoretical analysis is verified by comparison with an experimental implementation. The results show that the new algorithm correctly recovers the source clock at the destination, and satisfies the jitter specification set out by the ITU-T for G.702 signals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic noise -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication systems -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Electronic systems -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Phase noise</field><field name="subject">Timing jitter</field><field name="subject">AM noise</field><field name="subject">PM noise</field><field name="subject">Timing impairments</field><field name="subject">Timing transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) on Australian native bees</field><field name="creator">Paini, Dean</field><field name="description">The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) has been present in Australia for approximately 150 years. For the majority of that time it was assumed this species could only be of benefit to Australia&#8216;s natural ecosystems. More recently however, researchers and conservationists have questioned this assumption. Honey bees are an introduced species and may be affecting native fauna and flora. In particular, native bees have been highlighted as an animal that may be experiencing competition from honey bees as they are of similar sizes and both species require nectar and pollen for their progeny. Most research to date has focused on indirect measures of competition between honey bees and native bees (resource overlap, visitation rates and resource harvesting). The first chapter of this thesis reviews previous research explaining that many experiments lack significant replication and indirect measures of competition cannot evaluate the impact of honey bees on native bee fecundity or survival. Chapters two and four present descriptions of nesting biology of the two native bee species studied (Hylaeus alcyoneus and an undescribed Megachile sp.). Data collected focused on native bee fecundity and included nesting season, progeny mass, number of progeny per nest, sex ratio and parasitoids. This information provided a picture of the nesting biology of these two species and assisted in determining the design of an appropriate experiment. Chapters three and five present the results of two experiments investigating the impact of honey bees on these two species of native bees in the Northern Beekeepers Nature Reserve in Western Australia. Both experiments focused on the fecundity of these native bee species in response to honey bees and also had more replication than any other previous experiment in Australia of similar design. The first experiment (Chapter three), over two seasons, investigated the impact of commercial honey bees on Hylaeus alcyoneus, a native solitary bee. The experiment was monitored every 3-4 weeks (measurement interval). However, beekeepers did not agist hives on sites simultaneously so measurement intervals were initially treated separately using ANOVA. Results showed no impact of honey bees at any measurement interval and in some cases, poor power. Data from both seasons was combined in a Wilcoxon&#8216;s sign test and showed that honey bees had a negative impact on the number of nests completed by H. alcyoneus. The second experiment (Chapter 5) investigated the impact of feral honey bees on an undescribed Megachile species. Hive honey bees were used to simulate feral levels of honey bees in a BACI (Before/After, Control/Impact) design experiment. There was no impact detected on any fecundity variables. The sensitivity of the experiment was calculated and in three fecundity variables (male and female progeny mass and the number of progeny per nest) the experiment was sensitive enough to detect 15-30% difference between control and impact sites. The final chapter (Chapter six) makes a number of research and management recommendations in light of the research findings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Honeybee -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Honeybee -- Fertility -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Hylaeus -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Hylaeus -- Fertility -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Megachile -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Megachile -- Fertility -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Competition (Biology) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Honey bees</field><field name="subject">Native bees</field><field name="subject">Fecundity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body count : the politics of representing the gendered body in combat in Australia and the United States</field><field name="creator">Buttsworth, Sara</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the construction of the gendered body in combat in the late twentieth century, in Australia and the United States of America. While it is not a military history, aspects of military history, and representations of war and warriors are used as the vehicle for the analysis of the politics of representing gender. The mythic, the material and the media(ted) body of the gendered warrior are examined in the realms of &#8216;real&#8217; military histories and news coverage, and in the &#8216;speculative&#8217; arena of popular culture. Through this examination, the continuities and ruptures inherent in the gendered narratives of war and warriors are made apparent, and the operation of the politics of representing gender in the public arena is exposed. I have utilised a number of different approaches from different disciplines in the construction of this thesis: feminist and non-feminist responses to women in the military; aspects of military histories and mythologies of war specific to Australia and the United States; theories on the construction of masculinities and femininities; approaches to gender identity in popular news media, film and television. Through these approaches I have sought to bring together the history of women in the military institutions of Australia and the United States, and examine the nexus between the expansion of women&#8217;s military roles and the emergence of the female warrior hero in popular culture. I have, as a result, analysed the constructions of masculinity and femininity that inform the ongoing association of the military with &#8216;quintessential masculinity&#8217;, and deconstructed the real and the mythic corporeal capacities of the gendered body so important to warrior identity. Regardless, or perhaps because of, the importance of gender politics played out in and through the representations of soldier identity, all their bodies must be considered speculative.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia -- Armed Forces -- Women</field><field name="subject">United States -- Armed Forces -- Women</field><field name="subject">Women in combat -- Australia -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Women in combat -- United States -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Sex role -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Sex role -- United States</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hereditary haemochromatosis and the C282Y genotype : implications in diagnosis and disease</field><field name="creator">Kuek, Conchita Maria</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see the pdf format for the complete text.]  The discovery of the C282Y mutation and its role in the development of hereditary haemochromatosis has allowed a greater understanding into the effects of iron overload and its involvement in other conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. It has also allowed the better classification of heterozygotes, who were previously only diagnosed through the use of family studies. There are however, areas of conflict between phenotyping and genotyping methods. My research involved examining the relationship between Haemochromatosis and certain diseases such as diabetes and heart disease; genotyping versus phenotyping discrepancies and the possible interaction of secondary mutations. In Chapter 3 a population study was undertaken with the aim of comparing genotyping versus phenotyping methods as well as increasing general practitioner awareness regarding hereditary haemochromatosis and its diagnosis. It was determined that a minimum of 5000 subjects would be required to give the study sufficient power. Individuals were to be between the ages of 20&#8212;40 years, and thus presumably presymptomatic. Participation was entirely voluntary and a consent form was to be signed. Recruitment of subjects proved to be difficult and there was a selective bias towards individuals already displaying symptoms of haemochromatosis. In total less than a 100 subjects were recruited for the study. There were several issues encountered in the implementation of this study. Firstly the number of GPs participating was probably insufficient to recruit the subjects required. A more extensive campaign was probably required to enroll more GPs. Secondly it is very difficult for a busy GP to find the time necessary to explain the study to each of his patients and to get them to sign the consent form. Finally a bias developed in some of the requests. The subjects participating in this study were supposed to be random but in many cases the GPs had enrolled them in the study because they had symptoms of iron overload. In effect the biggest obstacle this study faced was the recruitment of subjects. Due to the small number of subjects little statistical data could be obtained from this study. It was noted, however, that genotyping methods detected two individuals who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Both also had increased transferrin saturation levels. Phenotyping detected 5 individuals with increased transferrin saturation. The three others detected via phenotyping were C282Y heterozygotes.  Haemochromatosis has long been though to be related to the development of diabetes due to the effect of iron overload on the pancreas. If this is so it would be logical to assume that the prevalence of haemochromatosis would be higher in a diabetic population. Chapter 4 examined the possibility that diabetics have a higher frequency of the C282Y mutation. A population group consisting of 1355 diabetics was genotyped for the C282Y mutation and iron studies were performed on all heterozygotes and C282Y homozygotes. Initial findings indicated that there was a significant difference between the diabetic and control population. However, this finding was the opposite of what was expected, there seemed to be a decreased frequency of the Y allele in the diabetic population rather than an increased one. The control and diabetic populations were not matched in terms of ethnicity. The removal of the ethnic bias in the diabetic population altered the statistics so there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups. This study highlighted the importance of using appropriate control populations as comparison groups. The final results of the study indicated that there was no significant difference between the diabetic population and the control population. This would seem to indicate that there is not an increased occurrence of the C282Y mutation in the diabetic population when compared to the control group.  Chapter 5 considered the possible association between C282Y heterozygosity and cardiovascular disease as well as the potential for early mortality. Several recent studies have indicated that C282Y heterozygosity may be a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, possibly on the basis of increased iron loading. Using a control population and a population of individuals with known coronary events the incidence of the C282Y mutation was compared against other risk factors. C282Y heterozygosity did not appear to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. There was however, a statistically significant link between increased ferritin in women and carotid plaques. A population of elderly women was genotyped in order to examine the effects of C282Y heterozygosity on longevity. The first hypothesis addressed in chapter 5 was that C282Y heterozygosity was a risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemochromatosis -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Haemochromatosis</field><field name="subject">Iron overload</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">C282Y genotype</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of unconfined ground water flow characteristics near a seepage-face boundary</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Matthew</field><field name="description">A quantitative understanding of ground water flow characteristics in unconfined aquifers is important because of the prevalence of abstraction from, and pollution of these systems. The current understanding of ground water flow in unconfined aquifers is limited because of the dominance of horizontal flow modelling strategies used to represent unconfined flow processes. The application of horizontal flow principles leads to an ignorance of seepage-face formation and can not predict the complicated three-dimensional nature of the ground water flow that dominates at the ground water-surface water interface. This study aims to address some of these deficiencies by exploring the true three-dimensional nature of ground water flow including the formation of seepage faces at the ground water-surface water interface using numerical and laboratory techniques. A finite element model for simulating two-dimensional (vertical) variably saturated flow is developed and benchmarked against standard laboratory and field-scale solutions. The numerical features of the finite element model are explored and compared to a simple finite difference formulation. The comparison demonstrates how finite element formulations lead to a broader spatial averaging of material properties and a different method for the representation of specified flux boundaries. A detailed comparison analysis indicates that these differences in the finite element solution lead to an improved approximation to the partial differential equation governing two-dimensional (vertical) variably saturated flow. A laboratory analysis of unconfined ground water flow and associated solute transport characteristics was performed. The analysis focused upon unconfined flow towards a pumping well. The laboratory observations were reliably reproduced using a three-dimensional (axi-symmetric), variably saturated ground water flow model. The model was benchmarked against the ground water flow characteristics such as the seepage-face height and total flow rate. In addition, the model was shown to reliably reproduce the solute transport features such as travel times and streamline distributions. This is the first time that a numerical model has been used to reliably reproduce the solute transport characteristics near a seepage-face boundary where the three-dimensional flow effects are prevalent. The ability to reliably predict solute transport patterns in the seepage-face zone is important since this region is known to support vital microbially facilitated reactions that control nutrient cycling and contaminant attenuation. The three-dimensional travel time distribution near the seepage-face was compared to that predicted using a horizontal flow modelling approach derived from the basic Dupuit-Forchheimer equations. The Dupuit-Forchheimer based model indicated that horizontal flow modelling would under-estimate the total residence time near a seepage-face boundary, thereby introducing a considerable source of error in a solute transport analysis. For this analysis, a new analytical solution for the steady travel time distribution in an unconfined aquifer subject to a single pumping well was derived. The analytical model has identified, for the first time in the hydrogeology literature, the use of the imaginary error function. The imaginary error function is a standard transcendental function and an infinite series approach to evaluate the function was successfully proposed. The two-dimensional (vertical) ground water flow model was extended to handle the case where the flow is driven by density gradients near the ground water-surface water interface. The unsteady, two-dimensional, Galerkin finite element model of density-dependent ground water flow in variably saturated porous media is rigorously presented and partially benchmarked under fully saturated (confined) conditions. The partial benchmarking involved reproducing solutions to the standard Henry salt-water intrusion and the Elder salt-convection problems. The model was used in a standard density-coupled and a new density-uncoupled mode to elucidate the worthiness of the Henry and Elder problems as benchmark standards. A comparison of the coupled and uncoupled solutions indicates that the Henry salt-water intrusion problem has limited worthiness as a benchmark as the patterns of ground water flow are relatively insensitive to density-coupled effects. Alternatively, the Elder problem is completely dependent upon a correct representation of the density-coupled flow and solute transport processes. The coupled versus uncoupled comparison is proposed as a new test of the worthiness of benchmark standards. The Henry salt-water intrusion problem was further analysed in an attempt to alleviate some of the difficulties associated with this benchmark problem. The numerical model was tested against a re-evaluated version of Henry's semi-analytical solution for the coupled solute concentration distribution. The numerical model was used to propose a modified version of the Henry problem where the importance of density-coupled processes was increased. The modified problem was shown to have an improved worthiness as compared to the standard solution. The numerical model results were benchmarked against a new set of semi-analytical results for the modified problem. Certain advantages in using the modified problem as a test case for benchmarking the results of a numerical model of density-dependent ground water flow are identified. A numerical investigation of the patterns of density-driven ground water flow at the ground water-surface water interface was undertaken. The numerical model is shown to produce grid-independent results for a finely discretised domain. The pattern of discharge is controlled, in part, by two parameters. One describes the recharge applied to the aquifer, and the second describes the magnitude of the density differences between the fresh recharging fluid and the saline receiving fluid. The influence of dense intrusions upon the formation of seepage-face boundaries at the ground water-surface water interface under steady-state conditions was also investigated. Dense intrusions are shown to dominate the pattern of ground water flow only under mild recharge conditions, while seepage faces dominate the outflow pattern under strong recharge conditions. Therefore, the formation of seepage-face boundaries and dense intrusions are unlikely to coincide under the conditions examined in this study.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Groundwater flow -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Seepage</field><field name="subject">Ground water</field><field name="subject">Ground water-surface water interface</field><field name="subject">Numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">Salt water intrusion</field><field name="subject">Laboratory modelling</field><field name="subject">Analytical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic cannabis use and attention-modulated prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex in humans</field><field name="creator">Kedzior, Karina Karolina</field><field name="description">Background. Various studies show that cannabis use alters attention and cognitive functioning in healthy humans and may contribute to development of schizophrenia or worsening of pre-existing psychosis. However, the impact of cannabis use on brain function in humans is not well understood. Schizophrenia is associated with a deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI), the normal inhibition of the startle reflex by a non-startling stimulus (prepulse), presented before the startle stimulus at short time intervals (lead-time intervals). Such PPI deficit is thought to reflect a sensorimotor gating dysfunction in schizophrenia. PPI is also modulated by attention and PPI reduction in schizophrenia is observed when patients are asked to attend to, not ignore, the stimuli producing PPI. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between self-reported chronic cannabis use and attentional modulation of PPI in healthy controls and in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the association between cannabis use and other startle reflex modulators, including prepulse facilitation (PPF) of the startle reflex magnitude at long lead-time intervals, prepulse facilitation of the startle reflex onset latency and habituation of the startle reflex magnitude, were examined. Method. Auditory-evoked electromyographic signals were recorded from orbicularis oculi muscles in chronic cannabis users (29 healthy controls and 5 schizophrenia patients) and non-users (22 controls and 14 patients). The data for 36 participants (12 non-user controls, 16 healthy cannabis users, and eight non-user patients) were used in the final analyses and the patient data were used as a pilot study, because relatively few participants met the rigorous exclusionary criteria. Participants were instructed to attend to or to ignore either the startle stimuli alone (70  100 dB) or prepulse (70 dB) and startle stimuli (100 dB) separated by short lead-time intervals (20  200 ms) and long lead-time intervals (1600 ms). In order to ignore the auditory stimuli the participants played a visually guided hand-held computer game. A pilot study showed that the response component of playing the game had no effects on attentional modulation of the startle reflex magnitude and onset latency. Results. Relative to controls, cannabis use in healthy humans was associated with a reduction in PPI similar to that observed in schizophrenia while attending to stimuli, and with an attention-dependent dysfunction in the startle reflex magnitude habituation. While ignoring the stimuli there were no statistical differences in PPI between cannabis users and controls, although PPI in cannabis users tended to differ from that of the patients. The reduction in PPI in cannabis users was correlated with the increased duration of cannabis use, in years, but not with the concentration of cannabinoid metabolites in urine or with the recency of cannabis use in the preceding 24 hours. Furthermore, cannabis use was not associated with any differences in PPF, onset latency facilitation, and startle reflex magnitude in the absence of prepulses. The accuracy of self-reports of substance use was also investigated in this study and was found to be excellent. In addition, the study examined the validity of the substance use module of the diagnostic interview, CIDI-Auto 2.1, which was found to be acceptable for cannabis misuse diagnoses (abuse and/or dependence). Finally, cannabis dependence was found to be associated with more diagnoses of mental illness other than schizophrenia (mainly depression). Conclusions. The results of the current study suggest that chronic cannabis use is associated with schizophrenia-like deficit in PPI in otherwise healthy humans. This PPI reduction is associated with attentional impairment rather than a global sensorimotor gating deficit in healthy cannabis users.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cannabis -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Cannabis -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Effect of drugs on</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Effect of drugs on</field><field name="subject">Startle reaction</field><field name="subject">Prepulse inhibition</field><field name="subject">Chronic cannabis use</field><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiresolution analysis of ultrasound images of the prostate</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Fangwei</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has become the urologist&#8217;s primary tool for diagnosing and staging prostate cancer due to its real-time and non-invasive nature, low cost, and minimal discomfort. However, the interpretation of a prostate ultrasound image depends critically on the experience and expertise of a urologist and is still difficult and subjective. To overcome the subjective interpretation and facilitate objective diagnosis, computer aided analysis of ultrasound images of the prostate would be very helpful. Computer aided analysis of images may improve diagnostic accuracy by providing a more reproducible interpretation of the images. This thesis is an attempt to address several key elements of computer aided analysis of ultrasound images of the prostate. Specifically, it addresses the following tasks: 1. modelling B-mode ultrasound image formation and statistical properties; 2. reducing ultrasound speckle; and 3. extracting prostate contour. Speckle refers to the granular appearance that compromises the image quality and resolution in optics, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and ultrasound. Due to the existence of speckle the appearance of a B-mode ultrasound image does not necessarily relate to the internal structure of the object being scanned. A computer simulation of B-mode ultrasound imaging is presented, which not only provides an insight into the nature of speckle, but also a viable test-bed for any ultrasound speckle reduction methods. Motivated by analysis of the statistical properties of the simulated images, the generalised Fisher-Tippett distribution is empirically proposed to analyse statistical properties of ultrasound images of the prostate. A speckle reduction scheme is then presented, which is based on Mallat and Zhong&#8217;s dyadic wavelet transform (MZDWT) and modelling statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients and exploiting their inter-scale correlation. Specifically, the squared modulus of the component wavelet coefficients are modelled as a two-state Gamma mixture. Interscale correlation is exploited by taking the harmonic mean of the posterior probability functions, which are derived from the Gamma mixture. This noise reduction scheme is applied to both simulated and real ultrasound images, and its performance is quite satisfactory in that the important features of the original noise corrupted image are preserved while most of the speckle noise is removed successfully. It is also evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing it with median, Wiener, and Lee filters, and the results revealed that it surpasses all these filters. A novel contour extraction scheme (CES), which fuses MZDWT and snakes, is proposed on the basis of multiresolution analysis (MRA). Extraction of the prostate contour is placed in a multi-scale framework provided by MZDWT. Specifically, the external potential functions of the snake are designated as the modulus of the wavelet coefficients at different scales, and thus are &#8220;switchable&#8221;. Such a multi-scale snake, which deforms and migrates from coarse to fine scales, eventually extracts the contour of the prostate</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate -- Ultrasonic imaging</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonic imaging -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Wavelets (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Multiresolution analysis</field><field name="subject">Wavelet transform</field><field name="subject">Transrectal ultrasound</field><field name="subject">B-mode</field><field name="subject">Segmentation</field><field name="subject">Speckle reduction</field><field name="subject">Denoising</field><field name="subject">Deformable models</field><field name="subject">Wavelet coefficients</field><field name="subject">Gamma mixture</field><field name="subject">Contour extraction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of the human diaphragm as a volume pump and measurement of its efficiency</field><field name="creator">Singh, Bhajan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]   The function of the diaphragm as a volume pump has not been adequately evaluated because there are no accurate methods to measure the volume displaced by diaphragm motion (&#916;Vdi).

It provides high bandwidth efficiency with low packing delay by allowing voice traffic from different AAL2 channels to be multiplexed onto a single ATM virtual channel connection. Examples of where AAL2 are used include the Code Division Multiple Access and the Third Generation mobile telephony networks. The main objective of this thesis is to study traditional and novel AAL2 multiplexing methods and to characterise their performance when carrying low and variable bit rate (VBR) voice traffic. This work develops a comprehensive QoS framework which is used as a basis to study the performance of the AAL2 multiplexer system. In this QoS framework the effects of packet delay, delay variation, subjective voice quality and bandwidth utilisation are all used to determine the overall performance of the end-to-end system for the support of real time voice communications. Extensions to existing AAL2 voice multiplexers are proposed and characterised. In the case where different types of voice applications are presented to the AAL2 multiplexer, it was observed that increased efficiency gains are possible when a priority queuing scheme is introduced into the traditional AAL2 multiplexer system. Studies of the voice traffic characteristics and their effects on the performance of the AAL2 multiplexer are also investigated. It is shown that particular source behaviours can have deleterious effect on the performance of the AAL2 multiplexer. Methods of isolating these voice sources are examined and the performance of the AAL2 multiplexer re-evaluated to show the beneficial effects of a particular source isolation technique. The extent to which statistical multiplexing is possible for real time variable VBR sources is theoretically examined. These calculations highlight the difficulties in multiplexing VBR real time traffic while maintaining guaranteed delay bounds for these sources. Based on these calculations, multiplexing schemes that incorporate data transfers within the real time traffic transfer are proposed as alternatives for utilising unused bandwidth caused by the VBR nature of the voice traffic.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asynchronous transfer mode</field><field name="subject">Multiplexing</field><field name="subject">ATM Adaptation Layer Type 2</field><field name="subject">ATM</field><field name="subject">AAL2</field><field name="subject">Voice traffic</field><field name="subject">Variable bit rate traffic</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing mallee eucalypts as short-rotation tree crops in the semi-arid wheatbelt of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Wildy, Daniel Thomas</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]   Insufficient water use by annual crop and pasture species leading to costly rises in saline watertables has prompted research into potentially profitable deep-rooted perennial species in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Native mallee eucalypts are currently being developed as a short-rotation coppice crop for production of leaf oils, activated carbon and bio-electricity for low rainfall areas (300&#8212;450 mm) too dry for many of the traditional timber and forage species. The research in this study was aimed at developing a knowledge base necessary to grow and manage coppiced mallee eucalypts for both high productivity and salinity control. This firstly necessitated identification of suitable species, climatic and site requirements favourable to rapid growth, and understanding of factors likely to affect yield of the desirable leaf oil constituent, 1,8-cineole. This was undertaken using nine mallee taxa at twelve sites with two harvest regimes. E. kochii subsp. plenissima emerged as showing promise in the central and northern wheatbelt, particularly at a deep acid sand site (Gn 2.61; Northcote, 1979), so further studies focussed on physiology of its resprouting, water use and water-use efficiency at a similar site near Kalannie. Young E. kochii trees were well equipped with large numbers of meristematic foci and adequate root starch reserves to endure repeated shoot removal. The cutting season and interval between cuts were then demonstrated to have a strong influence on productivity, since first-year coppice growth was slow and root systems appeared to cease in secondary growth during the first 1.5&#8212;2.5 years after cutting. After decapitation, trees altered their physiology to promote rapid replacement of shoots. Compared to uncut trees, leaves of coppices were formed with a low carbon content per unit area, and showed high stomatal conductance accompanied by high leaf photosynthetic rates. Whole-plant water use efficiency of coppiced trees was unusually high due to their fast relative growth rates associated with preferential investments of photosynthates into regenerating canopies rather than roots. Despite relatively small leaf areas on coppice shoots over the two years following decapitation, high leaf transpiration rates resulted in coppices using water at rates far in excess of that falling as rain on the tree belt area. Water budgets showed that 20 % of the study paddock would have been needed as 0&#8212;2 year coppices in 5 m wide twin-row belts in order to maintain hydrological balance over the study period. Maximum water use occurred where uncut trees were accessing a fresh perched aquifer, but where this was not present water budgets still showed transpiration of uncut trees occurring at rates equivalent to 3&#8212;4 times rainfall incident on the tree belt canopy. In this scenario, only 10 % of the paddock surface would have been required under 5 m wide tree belts to restore hydrological balance, but competition losses in adjacent pasture would have been greater</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinization -- Control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Coppicing -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Tree crops -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus oil -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Hedgerow intercropping -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Arid regions forestry -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Tree water use</field><field name="subject">Alley farming</field><field name="subject">Agroforestry</field><field name="subject">Oil mallee</field><field name="subject">Silviculture</field><field name="subject">Hydrology</field><field name="subject">Starch</field><field name="subject">Carbon isotype discrimination</field><field name="subject">Coppice</field><field name="subject">Resprouting</field><field name="subject">Short rotation forestry</field><field name="subject">Lignotuber</field><field name="subject">Gas exchange</field><field name="subject">Water use efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investigation of RANKL TNF-like core domain by truncation mutation</field><field name="creator">Tan, Jamie We-Yin</field><field name="description">Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells found exclusively in bone and are derived from the haematopoietic cells of monocytes/macrophage lineage. The cell-to-cell interaction between osteoblastic/stromal cells and osteoclast precursor cells is necessary for osteoclastogenesis. Receptor Activator of NF-&#954;B ligand (RANKL) was identified as a membrane-bound TNF ligand family member that is the &#8216;master&#8217; cytokine expressed on osteoblastic/stromal cells, which stimulate osteoclastogenesis through cell-to-cell contact with osteoclast precursors. RANKL is considered to be a factor that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of osteoclastogenesis (Lacey, et al., 1998). RANKL is a type II transmembrane cytokine of the TNF ligand superfamily and has an active TNF-like core domain at the extracellular domain. This active TNF-like core domain is thought to be the region through which it binds to it&#8217;s active receptor, RANK, for the activation of signal transduction pathways for the initiation of processes leading to osteoclastogenesis (Lacey, et al., 1998; Li, et al., 1999). It was hypothesized that any change in the active TNF-like core domain might affect the ability of RANKL binding to RANK and consequently affect the activation of signal transduction pathways and osteoclastogenesis. Hence, this thesis sought to investigate the effects of changes in the active TNF-like core domain by truncation mutation on the ability of RANKL binding to RANK and consequently affect the activation of signal transduction pathways and osteoclastogenesis. A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length TNF-like core domain of rat RANKL (rRANKL) (aa160-318) was cloned into the bacterial expression pGEX vectors and stably expressed in Eschechia coli as a fusion protein with the C-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Four mutants (aa160-302, aa160-268, aa239-318 and aa246-318) were also generated by truncation mutation in the TNF-like core domain, and cloned into the pGEX vector to produce GST-rRANKL mutants. The proteins were over-expressed and affinity purified to 95% in purity. GST-rRANKL (160-318) containing the full length TNF-like core domain was able to induced osteoclastogenesis in spleen cells in the presence of M-CSF and in RAW264.7 cells in the absence of M-CSF. It was also found to activate mature osteoclast activity in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. It has the highest binding affinity to RANK and the greatest potency for NF-&#954;B activation as well as the induction of osteoclastogenesis compared to the truncated mutants. Mutants generated by truncation of the TNF-like core domain revealed that the TNF-like core domain is important for the interaction with the RANK, for high binding affinity, NF-&#954;B activation and induction of osteoclastogenesis. In general, the truncated mutants not only displayed a reduction in the binding affinity to RANK, but also a reduction in NF-&#954;B activation, and significantly reduced potency in the induction of osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, mutant GST-rRANKL (160-268) showed a higher affectivity than the other mutants did, in that it had greater binding affinity to RANK, and in NF-&#954;B activation than the rest of the truncated mutants. Mutants GST-rRANKL (239-318) and GST-rRANKL (246-318) on the other hand, showed little potency in the induction of osteoclast formation, however, might have an inhibitory effect through competition with full length GST-rRANKL (160-318) as well as inducing a response in vivo resulting in an increase in the serum calcium level. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated that the TNF-like core domain of RANKL is active, and imperative in the binding to RANK, activating signal transduction pathways and induction of osteoclastogenesis. Changes in the active TNF-like core domain affected the ability, affinity and efficiency of RANKL binding to the receptor, RANK and consequently affected the activation of signal transduction pathways and osteoclastogenesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoclasts</field><field name="subject">Osteoclast inhibition</field><field name="subject">Bone resorption -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="subject">RANKL</field><field name="subject">TNF-like core domain</field><field name="subject">Osteoclastogenesis</field><field name="subject">RANKL mutants</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Candidate genes for obesity and related phenotypes</field><field name="creator">Swarbrick, Michael</field><field name="description">The current epidemic of obesity poses a substantial threat to public health worldwide. Obesity is associated with many deleterious health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, respiratory conditions, arthritis, and some forms of cancer. Moreover, the rising prevalence of obesity has been accompanied by a substantial increase in the cost of treating these conditions. Obesity results from a complex interaction between behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors. While the recent increase in the prevalence of obesity is largely due to behavioural factors (for example, physical inactivity); it has also been observed that genetic factors make a large contribution to individual susceptibility. In fact, studies indicate that as much as 50 - 80% of the variation in measures of obesity can be attributed to the effects of genes. Furthermore, closer examination of this genetic component using segregation analysis has indicated the presence of common genes for obesity, with large effects on the phenotype. However, these putative major genes for obesity have not yet been identified. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of three distinct genetic loci in obesity and related cardiovascular factors, including type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia. The aim of the first investigation was to test whether a common polymorphism (Pro12Ala) in the gene encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAR-&#947;2) was associated with obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors in a large group of Caucasian subjects. PPAR-&#947;2 is an adipogenic transcription factor, which also regulates insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue. No association was observed between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and obesity in Caucasians, but obese subjects carrying the Ala allele displayed an altered blood lipid profile compared with obese Pro/Pro subjects.  As the Pro12Ala polymorphism may exacerbate the risk of cardiovascular disease by modifying blood lipid profile in obesity, this relationship was examined further in a separate population. The aim of the second investigation was to determine whether the Pro12Ala polymorphism was associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and carotid intima-medial wall thickening in a population at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Australian Aboriginal people display high rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease, and it is possible that their increased susceptibility is due to genetic factors. However, the results from the Aboriginal population confirmed the results of the first study: there was no intrinsic association between the Pro12Ala variant and obesity. In addition, the Ala allele was not associated with deleterious changes in blood lipid profile, as it was in Caucasians. The aim of the third investigation was to confirm the presence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for obesity on chromosome 20q13. Highly polymorphic genetic markers in this region were tested for linkage and association with several measures of obesity in a Caucasian population. None of the measures of obesity were linked to or associated with markers spanning 20q13, suggesting that this chromosomal region does not contain a major locus for obesity in this Caucasian population. In the fourth investigation, the 5' sequence of Agouti Signalling Protein (ASIP) was identified. ASIP is a candidate gene for obesity, as it is expressed at high levels in adipocytes, and may participate in several obesity-related processes. Three new exons and two alternative promoters were identified for the ASIP gene. These results may lead to greater understanding of the role of ASIP in obesity and adipocyte metabolism; and may also be used to direct further research into genetic variation within this candidate gene.  In conclusion, extensive study of two established candidate genetic loci revealed no association with measures of obesity. Therefore, it is likely that loci other than these make significant contributions to obesity in humans. Further investigation of novel candidate genes, such as ASIP, may allow the identification of novel genetic polymorphisms and new pathways important for the genetic basis of obesity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Adipocyte</field><field name="subject">Polymorphism</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variations in gait  patterns and recovery of function following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy</field><field name="creator">Sturnieks, Daina Louise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Previous research has found that full recovery of knee function following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is often not achieved, and in the long-term, over 50% of these patients will develop knee osteoarthritis (OA). Mechanical factors are believed to contribute largely to the development of knee OA. High frequency loading has been shown to lead to degenerative joint changes in animal models. In human gait, the knee adduction moment during stance phase, which tends to load the medial articular surface of the tibiofemoral joint, has been associated with the presence, severity and progression of knee OA. Quadriceps weakness, which is common in people with knee pathology, has been associated with abnormal sagittal plane knee moments during gait, yet no studies have investigated the effect of knee strength on frontal plane kinetics. This work aimed to investigate gait mechanics in a post-APM population, determine the influence of neuromuscular factors on gait, and assess recovery of function over 12 months while examining factors associated with recovery. One hundred and six APM subjects were examined between one and three months postsurgery. Data were compared to an age-matched control group of 49 healthy adults. Subjects were aged 20 to 50 years and had been screened for: clinical and radiographic evidence of knee OA; previous or current knee joint disease or injury (other than the current meniscus pathology); or any other previous or existing disease or injury that may have an effect on gait, or predispose to joint disease.  Three-dimensional gait analysis was performed at a freely-chosen walking velocity, using a 50 Hz VICON three-dimensional motion analysis system, instrumented with two force platforms and 10-channel electromyography system. Subjects also underwent knee strength testing on a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Information was collected regarding subject&#8217;s physical activity levels, general health and knee function, as well as patient&#8217;s surgery specifics and rehabilitation regime.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee -- Endoscopic surgery</field><field name="subject">Meniscectomy</field><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Gait analysis</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Joint forces</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum waveguide theory</field><field name="creator">Midgley, Stuart</field><field name="description">The study of nano-electronic devices is fundamental to the advancement of the semiconductor industry. As electronic devices become increasingly smaller, they will eventually move into a regime where the classical nature of the electrons no longer applies. As the quantum nature of the electrons becomes increasingly important, classical or semiclassical theories and methods will no longer serve their purpose. For example, the simplest non-classical effect that will occur is the tunnelling of electrons through the potential barriers that form wires and transistors. This results in an increase in noise and a reduction in the device?s ability to function correctly. Other quantum effects include coulomb blockade, resonant tunnelling, interference and diffraction, coulomb drag, resonant blockade and the list goes on. This thesis develops both a theoretical model and computational method to allow nanoelectronic devices to be studied in detail. Through the use of computer code and an appropriate model description, potential problems and new novel devices may be identified and studied. The model is as accurate to the physical realisation of the devices as possible to allow direct comparison with experimental outcomes. Using simple geometric shapes of varying potential heights, simple devices are readily accessible: quantum wires; quantum transistors; resonant cavities; and coupled quantum wires. Such devices will form the building blocks of future complex devices and thus need to be fully understood. Results obtained studying the connection of a quantum wire with its surroundings demonstrate non-intuitive behaviour and the importance of device geometry to electrical characteristics.  The application of magnetic fields to various nano-devices produced a range of interesting phenomenon with promising novel applications. The magnetic field can be used to alter the phase of the electron, modifying the interaction between the electronic potential and the transport electrons. This thesis studies in detail the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation and impurity characterisation in quantum wires. By studying various devices considerable information can be added to the knowledge base of nano-electronic devices and provide a basis to further research. The computational algorithms developed in this thesis are highly accurate, numerically efficient and unconditionally stable, which can also be used to study many other physical phenomena in the quantum world. As an example, the computational algorithms were applied to positron-hydrogen scattering with the results indicating positronium formation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanowires</field><field name="subject">Quantum electronics</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Computer algorithms</field><field name="subject">Chebyshev approximation</field><field name="subject">Quantum waveguide theory</field><field name="subject">Nano electronics</field><field name="subject">Electronic propagation</field><field name="subject">Computational quantum theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional morphology and evolution of marsupial moles (Marsupialia: Notoryctemorphia)</field><field name="creator">Warburton, Natalie Marina</field><field name="description">Marsupial moles (genus Notoryctes) are the most highly specialised burrowing marsupials. The specialisations of the appendicular musculo-skeletal system of the marsupial moles are extensive and widespread; the major alterations are concentrated in, but not restricted to, the forelimb. Many of the derived features of the muscular system appear to be adaptations for improving the mechanical advantage of the limbs for burrowing. A number of the specialisations of the muscular system of the marsupial moles are convergent with those previously documented in other fossorial mammals, including golden moles, rodents and armadillos. There are, however, a number of unique specialisations of the musculo-skeletal system of Notoryctes. The functional morphology of the locomotor apparatus of marsupial moles is interpreted on the basis of the descriptions of the anatomy of the skeletal and muscular systems. The burrowing technique of the marsupial moles is a modified form of the parasagittal digging method that is used by other fossorial mammals, such as golden moles, armadillos and some rodents including pocket gophers. Differences in the functional morphology of the hindlimb between marsupial moles and other fossorial mammals are a reflection of the fact that marsupial moles do not construct permanent open burrow systems, but instead constantly dig through loose soil, backfilling as they progress. The functional morphology of the tail is uniquely specialised in the marsupial moles to function as the fifth limb during the pentapedal burrowing locomotion of marsupial moles. The remains of Miocene fossil marsupial mole, while clearly pleisiomorphic with respect to the appendicular skeletal morphology of modern notoryctids, demonstrate a high degree of specialisation for digging. It is hypothesised that the Miocene marsupial mole was already substantially specialised for a fossorial lifestyle, and thus pre-adapted for a subterranean lifestyle developed in correlation with the desertification of the Australian continent. Phylogenetic affinities of marsupial moles within the Marsupialia have long been enigmatic. While specialisation of the musculo-skeletal system have been so widespread as to obscure almost any phylogenetically relevant patterns, there is some evidence to support an association between notoryctids and peramelid bandicoots. Interspecific differences between the two species of marsupial moles, Notoryctes typhlops and N. caurinus, are minor but do support the separation of the two species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Notoryctidae -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Notoryctidae -- Evolution</field><field name="subject">Marsupial moles</field><field name="subject">Subterranean mammals</field><field name="subject">Notoryctes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in the abundance and diversity of the Proteaceae over the Cainozoic in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Itzstein-Davey, Freea</field><field name="description">South-western Australia is a globally significant hotspot of plant species diversity, with high endemism and many rare plant species. Proteaceae is a major component of the south-western flora, though little is known about how its diversity developed. This prompted the present study to investigate changes in the abundance and diversity of Proteaceae, in south-western Australia, by concurrently studying three sediment sequences of different ages over the Cainozoic and a modern pollen rain study. Modern pollen-vegetation relationships in the two Proteaceae species rich nodes of the northern and southern sandplains were quantified. It was found that Proteaceous genera can contribute up to 50% of the total pollen rain. Banksia/Dryandra pollen was the most abundant with Isopogon, Petrophile and Lambertia also commonly noted. The vegetation and environmental setting during three pivotal periods of the Cainozoic: Holocene, Pliocene and Eocene, were investigated. Eocene sediment from Lake Lefroy confirmed the presence of a Nothofagus dominated rainforest in the Middle to Late Eocene. At this time Proteaceae species were at least as diverse as today, if not more so, contributing up to a maximum of 42% of the total pollen rain. Taxa recorded included: Banksieaeidites arcuatus, Propylipollis biporus, Proteacidites confragosus, Proteacidites crassus, Proteacidites nasus and Proteacidites pachypolus. Several taxa remain undescribed and unnamed. This study also identified that Proteaceae pollen representation varies across small lateral distances. Thus as samples varied spatially and temporally, single core samples are not sufficient to identify spatial patterns in Proteaceae or other low pollen producing taxa. Some 7.91 cm of laminated Pliocene sediment from Yallalie, south-western Australia, was also examined. It covers 84 years of record and confirmed other regional reports that south-western Australia was covered by a rich vegetation mosaic consisting of heathy and wet rainforest elements. Although Proteaceae species were a consistent component of the pollen counts, diversity and abundance (maximum of 5%) was low throughout the studied section. Banksia/Dryandra types were most commonly noted.  A 2 m core was retrieved from Two Mile Lake, near the Stirling Ranges and provided an early Holocene vegetation history. Geochemical and palynological evidence recorded little change, suggesting the environment of deposition was relatively uniform. Proteaceae species were noted throughout the core, though in low numbers, at a maximum of 3.5 % of the total pollen rain. Banksia/Dryandra was the most abundant while Isopogon, Lambertia, Petrophile and Franklandia were also noted. A regression model was developed through the modern pollen rain study to predict the number of Proteaceae in the vegetation. This was also applied to the fossil pollen records. The estimated number of Proteaceae species in the Eocene suggests a maximum of 20 and a minimum of 10 taxa. For the Pliocene record, an estimated 7 - 9 species was found and for the Holocene pollen, between 7 - 8 were present. Thus the Eocene was similar in Proteaceae diversity to today. The results from the Pliocene and Holocene suggest that Proteaceae diversity was lower than today. Findings of this research indicate that Proteaceae species are an important and consistent component of vegetation in south-western Australia over the Cainozoic. It is likely that both changing pollination mechanisms and changes in associated vegetation are important in the determining the dispersal of Proteaceaous pollen. By understanding how the vegetation has changed and developed in south-western Australia, present vegetation can be managed to include intra-specific variation and ensure the majority of species are conserved for present and future generations to enjoy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Western Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Pollen -- Western Australia, Southwestern -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Palynology -- Western Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Pollen, Fossil -- Western Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Modern pollen rain</field><field name="subject">Eocene</field><field name="subject">Pliocene</field><field name="subject">Holocene</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae : epidemiology, virulence factors and neuraminidase studies</field><field name="creator">Wang, Qinning</field><field name="description">Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a Gram-positive bacillus, has long been an important pathogen in veterinary medicine as well as a cause of serious disease in humans. Infections caused by this organism have economic impact on animal industries, causing erysipelas in swine and morbidities in other farmed animals. Human infections are commonly erysipeloid (skin cellulitis) and occasionally septicaemia or endocarditis. Little is known of the diagnosis, epidemiology and pathogenesis of such infections in Western Australia. The aims of this thesis were to establish new diagnostic techniques for the detection and recovery of E. rhusiopathiae, to describe the epidemiology of Erysipelothrix infection in Western Australia in humans and animals, and to characterize virulence-associated characteristics, especially focusing on the neuraminidase produced by the organism. A protocol using 48 h Brain Heart Infusion enrichment followed by subculture to selective agar containing antibiotics achieved the highest recovery rate of 37% in a seafood survey. Twentyone isolates of Erysipelothrix spp., of which 19 were identified as E. rhusiopathiae, were obtained. Two published PCR assays for differentiating E. rhusiopathiae and other Erysipelothrix species were evaluated and the best PCR detection rate achieved was 67% following selective enrichment. The PCR method was 50% more sensitive than the culture method. Epidemiological surveys using the above methods showed that E. rhusiopathiae infection is present in farmed animals in Western Australia. The PCR positive frequencies (3.3-3.7%) and isolate recovery rate (2.8-3.3%) in samples from pig and sheep abattoirs and carcass washings indicate a potential threat to the economy of the farmed animal industry as well as a public health concern with the occurrence of E. rhusiopathiae in meat for consumption. Positive PCR results (1.1%) from human skin swabs of patients with cellulitis and wounds may suggest the existence of Erysipelothrix colonization in the general population. Genetic relatedness of 92 isolates of Erysipelothrix species from various sources was analyzed and a total of 64 distinct PFGE patterns identified. Isolates were further classified into 20 clonal groups based on pattern similarities, and most E. rhusiopathiae were clustered into six groups. A few patterns of other Erysipelothrix species were clustered into separate groups from E. rhusiopathiae but shared greater than 70% similarity with E. rhusiopathiae. The genetic relatedness of colonial variants was well demonstrated using this method. PFGE typing promises to be a useful tool for epidemiological and taxonomic studies of Erysipelothrix. Several virulence-associated factors were characterized in 86 isolates of Erysipelothrix spp. A rapid and sensitive peanut lectin hemagglutination assay for neuraminidase was developed and the influence of media, incubation conditions and pH on the production of the enzyme was investigated. All 61 isolates of E. rhusiopathiae produced neuraminidase in cooked meat broth with titres between 1:10 and 1:320, with no significant difference in titre among isolates from different sources. The enzyme activity was not detected in non-pathogenic Erysipelothrix spp. Capsule was produced by 78.7% of isolates of E. rhusiopathiae but not by other species, while both hyaluronidase and haemolysin were produced by non-pathogenic Erysipelothrix spp. It was concluded that neuraminidase and capsule are most likely to be virulence factors of E. rhusiopathiae.  The gene encoding neuraminidase was cloned from the type strain E. rhusiopathiae ATCC 19414. The cloned fragment was a functional partial nanH gene with a mol% G+C of 39.7. The predicted amino acid sequence displayed homology with many microbial neuraminidases and contained conserved sequences found in most bacterial neuraminidases. Southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the gene was present as a single copy on the bacterial genomic DNA. A neuraminidasenegative mutant vector was constructed by insertional inactivation using a tetM cassette. This has provided starting material for developing a neuraminidase-deficient E. rhusiopathiae mutant, which will permit the study of the role of neuraminidase in pathogenesis. Based on the cloned sequence, a sensitive neuraminidase-specific nested PCR technique was designed and optimized. The specificity was tested in 61 isolates of E. rhusiopathiae, 25 Erysipelothrix species, and 62 other species of neuraminidaseproducing and non-producing bacteria. All isolates of E. rhusiopathiae were PCR positive and all other bacteria were negative; thus this PCR is a highly specific method suitable for application in clinical investigations of Erysipelothrix infection. In conclusion, the present study has contributed new knowledge of the biology of Erysipelothrix spp. and current occurrence of Erysipelothrix infections in Western Australia, as well as to the understanding of pathogenesis of E. rhusiopathiae. Development of several new cultural and molecular approaches in combination with other established techniques will facilitate future studies of the epidemiology, taxonomy and pathogenesis of this bacterial species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Neuraminidase</field><field name="subject">Gene cloning</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">PFGE typing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization and identification of transcription factors that bind to the tumor necrosis factor -308 polymorphism</field><field name="creator">Woo, Andrew Jonghan</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated.  Please see the pdf version of this abstract for an accurate reproduction.] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates a long list of immunological and pathophysiological processes. TNF is produced by a wide variety of cells including immune and non-immune cells, however in most cell types TNF is not expressed prior to stimulation. The function of TNF is mediated via its trimeric domain by binding to TNF receptors that are found on most types of cells, especially of the haematopoietic systems, hence transpiring its effects on a wide variety of cells and organ systems. The cytotoxic (apoptosis) and pro-inflammatory (differentiation, proliferation and activation) functions of TNF are protective but can also result in pathological or deleterious consequences. A biallelic G to A transition polymorphism in the promoter region of TNF at nucleotide position 308 from the transcription start site is suggested to be involved in differential transcriptional regulation of TNF expression. The high TNF producing 308A allele is associated with susceptibility to or worse outcome of many infectious diseases in addition to autoimmune and other pathophysiological conditions. A previous study in our laboratory observed a selective affinity towards the polymorphic 308A allele by an EMSA protein(s) complex, named E. Several other protein complexes were found along with complex E and one of them was identified as Sp1. The identification of complex E was unsuccessful but it was hypothesized to play a major role as transcriptional activator in 308A allele individuals hence transpiring its effect in various pathophysiological states. In this study, the EMSA complexes observed in the TNF promoter region between nucleotides 322 to 283, encompassing the 308 polymorphism, is characterized. EMSA using mutated oligonucleotides mapped the binding sites of complexes B, C, D and E. TRANSFAC database search in addition to previous work revealed the identity of complex C as Sp1 but the rest of complexes remained unknown. Moreover, in contrast to our previous study, the protein(s) in the complex E was found to preferentially bind 308G nucleotide hence posing as a transcriptional repressor, resulting in decreased production state of TNF in 308G allele individuals than 308A allele individuals. In order to characterize putative transcription factors binding to the promoter region, first the biochemical characteristics such as the effects of temperature, salts and cations on DNA binding ability of EMSA complexes were studied. EMSA complexes B, C, DI and E required cations, probably Zn+2, to bind DNA. By optimizing a technique that couples EMSA with SDS-PAGE, the molecular weight of C, DI and E was determined. A novel technique that couples EMSA with IEF determined the pI of complexes B, C, D, DI and E. Although a commonly used technique of identifying unknown DNA-binding protein of interest, Yeast One-Hybrid assay, did not identify complex E, the novel identification method involving chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, EMSA, mass spectrometry and database interrogation successfully identified TNF EMSA complex E as transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1). Supershift EMSA confirmed complex E as YY1. In addition, the supershift assay showed presence of Sp1 and Sp3 in complex C. Similarly, complex DI is identified as Sp3. The novel method in identifying DNA-binding proteins is particularly useful as this technique allows identification of protein seen in EMSA without the need of extensive identification process.  YY1 binds to a 6 base pair sequence, 5? TTGAGG 3?, from nt 295 to 290 of TNF promoter. The loss of affinity in 308A allele is caused by transition of underlined G nucleotide to A. The determined and described molecular weight of YY1 in literature is 60 kDa while the theoretical weight is 45 kDa. Both the determined and theoretical pI of YY1 is 5.8. YY1 is a multifunctional transcription factor implicated in both positive and negative regulation of gene expression as well as in initiation of transcription. It is ubiquitously expressed in growing, differentiated, and growth-arrested cells. Although future experiment is yet to establish in vivo presence of YY1 in TNF promoter, our study so far provides convincing evidence that the putative transcription factor that has selective affinity towards 308G allele is indeed YY1.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="subject">Genetic transcription -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">Transcription factors</field><field name="subject">Genetic polymorphisms</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Promoters (Genetics)</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade unions in Sri Lanka under globalisation : reinventing worker solidarity</field><field name="creator">Biyanwila, Janaka</field><field name="description">This study examines trade union resistance to the post 1977 Export Oriented Industrialisation (EOI) strategies in Sri Lanka, and the possibilities of developing new strategic options. In contrast to perspectives that narrow unions to political economic dimensions, this study emphasises the cultural and the movement dimensions of unions. The purpose of the study is to understand the ways unions can regain their role as civil society actors on the basis of building worker solidarity. The study is divided into two main parts. The first part focuses on the features and tendencies of social movement unionism as advancing new possibilities towards revitalising unions. Under globalisation, unions are faced with an increasingly casualised labour force with more women absorbed as wage workers. The promotion of labour market deregulation and privatisation, endorsed by neo-liberal ideologies of competitive individualism, illustrates the narrowing of unions to the workplace while undermining worker solidarity. The first part of this research describes the impact of :neo-liberal globalisation on trade unions; conceptualisation of and resistance to globalisation; the essence of trade unions; social movement unionism and labour internationalism. According to social movement unionism perspectives, party independent union strategies, based on elements of internal democracy and structured alliances open the possibility of emphasising the movement dimension of unions. The second part explains the context of unions in Sri Lanka, focusing on three unions - the Nurses, Tea Plantation workers, and Free Trade Zone workers. In terms of the structural context, Sri Lankan unions faced a multi-faceted weakening under the post-1977 EOI policies. The assertion of an authoritarian state, promoting interests of capital, enhanced the fragmentation of unions along party differences that were further compounded by divisions along ethnic identity politics. Moreover, the increasing militarisation of the state, which maintains a protracted ethnic war, reinforced coercive state strategies restraining union resistance and shrinking the realm of civil society. In confronting state strategies of labour market deregulation and privatisation, the enduring party subordinated unions are increasingly inadequate. In contrast, the three unions in this study express forms of party-independent union strategies. By analysing their modes of resistance  related to the articulation of worker interests, their organisational modes, and their engagement in representative and movement politics  the study explores the possibility of developing a social movement unionism orientation in order to regain their role as civil society actors</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labor unions -- Sri Lanka -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Trade unions</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Labour movement</field><field name="subject">Labour internationalism</field><field name="subject">Social movements</field><field name="subject">Social movement unionism</field><field name="subject">Solidarity</field><field name="subject">Civil society</field><field name="subject">Corporate agency</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomarkers of tea and coffee-derived polyphenol exposure in human subjects</field><field name="creator">Chan, Shin Yee</field><field name="description">Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. Polyphenols found in tea are predominantly flavonoids, of which up to 15% are present as free or esterified gallic acid. Coffee polyphenols are almost wholly comprised of chlorogenic acids. Many of the demonstrated activities of polyphenols are consistent with favourable effects on the risk of chronic diseases. In investigating the relationships between intake and exposure to such compounds and chronic disease-related endpoints, it is important to be able to identify biomarkers that are specific to the compounds of interest. 4-O-methyl gallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid have been identified as potential biomarkers of intake and exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee, respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid from chlorogenic acid in coffee. The major objectives of the research which is the subject of this thesis were (1) to establish a dose-response relationship of 24h urinary excretions of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid following ingestions of black tea and coffee of different strengths, and (2) to explore relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in human populations. It was found that there was rapid excretion of both 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in the first 6h after tea and coffee ingestion, respectively. Approximately 60  80% of the ingested dose was excreted during the first 6h after ingestion. Urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid was directly related to the dose of tea and coffee, respectively. That is, higher intake resulted in increased urinary excretion of the metabolites. The relationships of 24h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid with long-term usual (111 participants) and contemporary recorded current (344 participants) tea and coffee intake were assessed. 4OMGA was strongly related to usual (r = 0.50, P &lt; 0.001) and current (r = 0.57, P &lt; 0.001) tea intake. Isoferulic acid was less strongly, but significantly associated with usual (r = 0.26, P = 0.008) and current (r = 0.18, P &lt; 0.001) coffee intake.  Overall, the results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker for black tea derived polyphenol intake and exposure, but isoferulic acid may have only limited use as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemical markers</field><field name="subject">Gallic acid</field><field name="subject">Chlorogenic acid</field><field name="subject">4-0-methyl Gallic acid</field><field name="subject">Isoferulic acid</field><field name="subject">Tea polyphenols</field><field name="subject">Coffee polyphenols</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary student writing, change and feedback : a negotiation of form, content and contextual demands</field><field name="creator">Vardi, Iris</field><field name="description">This study aimed to examine the relationship between teacher written feedback and change in the writing of tertiary students in their final year of undergraduate study through investigating: (i) the characteristics of final year undergraduate tertiary students&#8217; texts prior to receiving feedback; (ii) the way these characteristics change after written feedback is given; and (iii) the relationship between the changes made and the types of feedback given. The study examined student texts and teacher written feedback that arose naturally out of a third year disciplinary-based unit in which the students each submitted a text three times over the course of a semester, each time receiving feedback and a mark prior to rewriting and resubmitting. Two in-depth non-quantitative analyses were conducted: one analysing the characteristics of each of the students&#8217; texts and how these changed over the course of the process, the other analysing the relationship between the different types of feedback and the changes that occurred in the subsequent text. The analysis of the students&#8217; texts and their changes covered: (i) coherence; (ii) the sources used and the manner in which these were cited and referenced; (iii) academic expression and mechanics; and (iv) additional expectations and requirements of the writing task. These characteristics and their changes were related to the instructional approaches to which all the students had been exposed in their first, second and third year studies. The analysis shows that, on their own accord, the third year students were able to produce a range of generalisable characteristics reflecting the &#8220;basics&#8221; in writing and demands specific to the tertiary context that had been revealed through the instructional approaches used. The problems in the students&#8217; texts were mainly related to (i) executing and expressing the specific requirements of the task and (ii) their reading of the social context. Most of the changes in the texts were related to the feedback given. Some of these changes directly resolved problems, however, others did not. Some changes occurred to accommodate other changes in the text and some were made to satisfy a demand of the lecturer  sometimes resulting in a problem that did not present in the previous text. These findings enabled insights to be drawn on two major views of tertiary student writing: the deficit view in which the problems in student&#8217;s texts are seen to be due to a lack of &#8220;basic skills&#8221;; and the view that students&#8217; problems arise due to the new demands of the tertiary context. The study found that the deficit view and the &#8220;new demands&#8221; view were unable to explain all the characteristics of the students&#8217; texts and their changes. Arising out of these findings, this study proposes that the characteristics of a student&#8217;s text show the end result of how that student negotiated and integrated his/her understanding of form, content and contextual demands at the time of writing. In analysing the relationship between the different types of feedback and the changes that occurred, the feedback was categorised according to the issue that was being addressed, the manner in which it was given, and its scope. The different types of feedback were directly related to the changes that occurred in the students&#8217; subsequent rewrites. The analysis shows that clear direct feedback on which students can act is strongly related to change where it (i) addresses characteristics that could be readily integrated into the existing text without the need to renegotiate the integration of form, content and contextual demands OR (ii) addresses characteristics and indicates to students how to negotiate the integration between form, content and contextual demands where integration in the text needs to change. In addition, the analysis shows that change is further influenced by the balance between the various individual points of feedback and the degree to which they reinforced each other. The findings from both analyses in this study show that the use of feedback that is strongly related to change can improve the writing of all students beyond what they learn through other instructional approaches to writing.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Written communication -- Study and teaching (Higher)</field><field name="subject">Written communication -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Report writing -- Study and teaching (Higher)</field><field name="subject">Report writing -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Tertiary student writing</field><field name="subject">Writing development</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the mechanisms of magnetisation change in permanent magnet materials through the interpretation of hysteresis measurements</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Simon Andrew</field><field name="description">The mechanisms by which magnetisation changes occur in magnetic materials may be investigated by a variety of hysteresis measurements. During this study both alternating and rotational hysteresis measurements were used to characterise the mechanisms of magnetisation change in a number of permanent magnet materials. Studies of the time dependence of magnetisation, remanent magnetisations and the dependence of the reversible magnetisation on the irreversible magnetisation were undertaken. These studies revealed that in sintered rare-earth iron magnets the magnetisation change is predominately controlled by domain nucleation, with a lesser contribution from domain wall pinning within the boundary regions of the grains. Similar mechanisms control the magnetisation change in the larger grains of melt-quenched rare-earth iron magnets. In the single domain grains of the melt-quenched materials incoherent rotation mechanisms control the changes of magnetisation. Magnetisation change in MnAlC and sintered AlNiCo was found to be controlled by domain wall pinning within the interior of the grains of the materials. Two devices were constructed for the measurement of rotational hysteresis. The first measures the angular acceleration of a sample set spinning in a magnetic field, from which the rotational hysteresis loss may be determined. The second employs rotating search coils to make direct measurements of the component of magnetisation that contributes to rotational hysteresis loss during the rotation of a sample in a field. Both devices were found to produce data consistent with that in the literature and to be useful for the characterisation of rotational hysteresis in permanent magnet materials. A simple model was used to examine the dependence of rotational hysteresis loss on various material parameters. It was found that the value of the rotational hysteresis integral is dependent on interactions and to a lesser extent distributions in anisotropy. This is contrary to assumptions commonly made in the literature but consistent with published experimental data, which has been reinterpreted. Measurements of rotational hysteresis losses in the materials studied were found to be effected by geometric demagnetisation effects. A method by which such data may be corrected for these effects is proposed. Following correction and consideration of the interactions within the materials, the rotational hysteresis data was found to be consistent with the characterisations performed in linearly alternating  fields.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetization</field><field name="subject">Permanent magnets</field><field name="subject">Magnets -- Viscosity</field><field name="subject">Hysteresis -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Rotational hysteresis</field><field name="subject">Reversible magnetisation</field><field name="subject">DABAAM</field><field name="subject">RSCM</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anxiety and working memory : an investigation and reconceptualisation of the Processing Efficiency Theory</field><field name="creator">Chong, Joyce L.Y.</field><field name="description">A dominant theory in the anxiety-working memory literature is the Processing Efficiency Theory (Eysenck &amp; Calvo, 1992). According to this theory, worry - the cognitive component of state anxiety - pre-empts capacity in the central executive and phonological loop components within Baddeley and Hitch's (1974) fixed-capacity working memory system. Central to the Processing Efficiency Theory is the distinction between performance effectiveness (i.e. quality of performance) and processing efficiency (i.e. performance effectiveness divided by effort), with anxiety proposed to impair efficiency to a greater extent than it does effectiveness. The existing literature has provided support for this theory, although there exist factors that complicate the findings, including the nature of the working memory tasks utilised, comorbid depression, and the distinction between trait and state anxiety. Clarification of the limiting factors in the anxiety-working memory literature was sought over a series of initial methodological studies. The first study was an initial step in addressing the issue of comorbid depression, identifying measures that maximised the distinction between anxiety and depression. The second study identified verbal and spatial span tasks suitable for examining the various working memory systems. The third study considered a possible role for somatic anxiety in the anxiety-working memory relationship, and additionally addressed the state/trait anxiety distinction. These three initial studies culminated in the fourth study which formally addressed the predictions of the Processing Efficiency Theory, and explored the cognitive/somatic anxiety distinction more fully. For the third and fourth studies, high and low trait anxious individuals underwent either cognitive (ego threat instruction) or somatic (anxious music) stress manipulations, and completed a series of span tasks assessing all components of the working memory system. Unexpectedly, the fourth study yielded a notable absence of robust effects in support of the Processing Efficiency Theory. A consideration of the research into the fractionation of central executive processes, together with an examination of tasks utilised in the existing literature, suggested that anxiety might not affect all central executive processes equally. Specifically, the tasks utilised in this programme of research predominantly invoke the process of updating, and it has recently been suggested that anxiety may not actually impair this process (Dutke &amp; Stober, 2001). This queried whether the current conceptualisation of the central executive component as a unified working memory system within the PET was adequate or if greater specification of this component was necessary. One central executive process identified as possibly mediating the anxiety-working memory relationship is that of inhibition, and the focus of the fifth study thus shifted to clarifying this more complex relationship. In addition to one of the verbal span tasks utilised in the third and fourth studies, the reading span task (Daneman &amp; Carpenter, 1980) and a grammatical reasoning task (MacLeod &amp; Donnellan, 1993) were also included. Inhibitory processing was measured using the directed ignoring task (Hopko, Ashcraft, Gute, Ruggerio, &amp; Lewis, 1998). This study established that inhibition was affected by a cognitive stress manipulation and inhibition also played a part in the anxiety-working memory link. However other central executive processes were also implicated, suggesting a need for greater specification of the central executive component of working memory within the PET. A finding that also emerged from this, and the third and fourth studies, was that situational stress, rather than trait or state anxiety, was predominantly responsible for impairments in working memory. Finally, a theoretical analysis placing the anxiety-working memory relationship within a wider context was pursued, specifically examining how the Processing Efficiency Theory is nested within other accounts examining the relationship between mood and working memory. In particular, similarities between the theoretical accounts of the relationships between anxiety and working memory, and depression and working memory, suggest the operation of similar mechanisms in the way each mood impacts on performance. Despite the similarities, potential distinctions between the impact each has on performance are identified, and recommendations for future research are made.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Short-term memory</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Working memory</field><field name="subject">Inhibition</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Processing Efficiency Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mycorrhizal symbiosis as a strategy for survival in ultramafic soils</field><field name="creator">Boulet, Frederic</field><field name="description">Ultramafic soils enriched in nickel, such as found in Australia and New Caledonia, are associated with unique, diverse and poorly known vegetation communities. Re-establishment of these highly specific ecosystems is still a challenge for Ni mining companies. Ultramafic vegetation communities are the outcome of a long evolution process resulting in their adaptation to the extreme soil conditions found on ultramafic outcrops. Mycorrhizal fungi, a very common plant symbiont, are generally thought to be beneficial to plants in other ecosystems, providing plants with phosphorus and even promoting metal tolerance in plants in some cases. We examined the hypothesis that mycorrhizal fungi may contribute to the survival of plants in ultramafic soil conditions. Bandalup Hill, an ultramafic outcrop enriched in Ni (South West of Western Australia) was selected to assess the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to ultramafic plants. Soil constraints, in particular the degree of Ni toxicity, were assessed at two sites with ultramafic soils within the outcrop. Total metal, nutrient, DTPA extractable Ni and available P were measured in soil while Ni, Ca and Mg were tested in the soil solution. In addition, nutrients and metals were analyzed in shoots of some plant species occurring at each site: Eucalyptus flocktoniae, Melaleuca pomphostoma, Melaleuca coronicarpa and Hakea verucosa. Topsoils in Bandalup Hill and plant shoots had high levels of Ni, and very low levels of P, K and N. Variation in DTPA extractable Ni between sites reflected the variation in shoot Ni level of E. flocktoniae and M. pomphostoma. Variations in soil solution Ni levels reflected variations in shoot Ni levels of M. coronicarpa and H. verucosa between sites.  The germination requirements of the plant species used to assess the soil constraints was assessed. Species selected included Eucalyptus flocktoniae, Melaleuca coronicarpa, and Hakea verucosa. Seeds of E. flocktoniae and M. coronicarpa had a higher germination rate if pre-treated with smoke water, while no pre-treatment was required to germinate H. verucosa seeds. The unusual germination requirement of E. flocktoniae and M. coronicarpa involve complex chemical signals that may be present in the soil when the conditions are more favorable for plant establishment. Such unusual germination requirement may represent an adaptation to the hostile conditions of the ultramafic soils of Bandalup Hill. The mycorrhizal association and root characteristics of the selected plant species was also assessed after 8 weeks of growth in undisturbed ultramafic topsoil cores from Bandalup Hill. Roots of these species (including H. verucosa from a previously designated non-mycorrhizal family, Proteaceae) were associated with mycorrhizal fungi. Roots of E. flocktoniae and M. coronicarpa were colonized by both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM), while roots of H. verucosa only contained some AM fungal structures. All species had high shoot to root ratios and their root characteristics reflected their association with mycorrhizal fungi. Based on the previous observations, uninoculated and inoculated E. flocktoniae seedlings were grown for 10 to 16 weeks in sand amended with Ni at 0, 0.2, 1 and 2.3 mg/kg. Mycorrhizal inoculum consisted of spores of Pisolithus sp. (ECM) or a mix of AMF spores and colonized root fragments, both originating from Bandalup Hill. Another inoculum consisted in Pisolithus sp. spores from a site with ultramafic soils in New Caledonia. Inoculation with AM and ECM fungi from Bandalup Hill was beneficial to E. flocktoniae. Benefits consisted mainly of a reduction of Ni shoot translocation at the highest Ni soil level. At 1 mg/kg soil Ni, E. flocktoniae exhibited a certain degree of tolerance to Ni. A substantial increase in growth and nutrient uptake with Pisolithus sp. from Western Australia was also observed. The contribution of AM fungi from Bandalup Hill to E. flocktoniae, M. coronicarpa, H. verucosa, and Trifolium subterraneum (clover) was then examined in ultramafic soil from Bandalup Hill.Steaming of ultramafic soil increased the availability and plant uptake of P. Consequently, uninoculated seedlings grew better, and inoculation with AM fungi decreased the growth of native plant species but did not affect their shoot Ni concentration. The presence of AM fungi increased the concentration of P in shoots of native plants species. Inoculation had no effect on the growth and nutrient content of subterranean clover. As mining activities have the potential to reduce the infectivity of AM fungi in topsoils, the effect of disturbance and storage practices on the AM infectivity of ultramafic topsoils collected in summer or winter from Bandalup Hill was investigated. Disturbance consisted in passing topsoil through a 2mm seive and cutting roots into 1cm fragments. Disturbed topsoil was then stored at room temperature in pots that were either sealed from the atmosphere or left open, and pots were maintained at field capacity. E. flocktoniae seedlings were planted in undisturbed and disturbed topsoil just after topsoil collect and then after 3, 6 and 9 months of topsoil storage. AM fungi present in the topsoil collected in summer was less susceptible to initial disturbance than AM fungi present in topsoil collected during winter. Also, storage of topsoil in sealed pots watered to field capacity was more detrimental to its infectivity than storage of topsoil in dry conditions. Mycorrhizal fungi can contribute to the survival of some native plant species in the ultramafic soils of Bandalup Hill and they may represent another strategy to improve the success of Ni mine revegetation. However, such contribution may not be the unique avenue for native plants to survive in ultramafic soils of Bandalup Hill.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizas</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Nickel content</field><field name="subject">Ultramafic soils</field><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Serpentine</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of alcohol and beverage type on cardiovascular disease risk factors</field><field name="creator">Zilkens, Renate Ruth</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Two randomised controlled trials were conducted to explore the relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Study 1 was primarily designed to test the hypothesis that the cardio-protective effect of light alcohol could be mediated, in part, via improvements in endothelial function. Study 1 was also designed to explore the effect of alcohol on both traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as changes in lipid profile, haemostatic factors and blood pressure, and novel risk factors such as homocysteine, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The experimental design of this study also allowed us to determine whether reducing alcohol intake in these moderate-to-heavy drinkers could improvement insulin sensitivity, a component of the metabolic syndrome. In this group of sixteen healthy middle-aged men with a history of moderate to heavy alcohol intake of seven standard drinks per day, reducing intake down to approximately one standard drink per day for four weeks had no beneficial effects on conduit vessel endothelial function as assessed by post-ischaemic brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation, nor were there any detectable changes in soluble E-selectin, endothelin-1 and von Willebrand Factor, which are considered biomarkers of endothelial activation. As this study did not investigate the effect of alcohol on endothelial function in resistance vessels, it cannot exclude the possibility that alcohol may affect endothelial cells resident in that vascular bed. This study does show and confirm, however, that the relationship between alcohol and risk factors for cardiovascular disease is an extremely complex one. On the one hand it demonstrated that alcohol was potentially harmful, increasing blood pressure, plasma F2-isoprostane (oxidative stress), and homocysteine. On the other hand it showed that increasing alcohol intake led to significant reductions in two (i.e. fibrinogen and IL-6) of five inflammatory markers, in addition to improving the HDL-cholesterol profile of these subjects. Although the effects of alcohol on blood pressure, fibrinogen and HDL-cholesterol are not in themselves new, they support our choice of study design and strengthen the argument in favour of accepting the more novel findings of this study, specifically, the lack of effect on endothelial function and insulin sensitivity, and the harmful effect of alcohol in increasing oxidative stress and homocysteine.  Study 2 was primarily designed to test the hypothesis that the consumption of red wine may confer greater cardio-protection than beer via improvements in endothelial function. Simultaneously, the study was also designed to determine whether drinking red wine for 4-weeks would have different effects than beer on either traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (i.e. blood pressure and lipid profile) or the more novel risk factors, homocysteine and oxidative stress. Using a randomised controlled cross-over study design, Study 2 provides evidence that the regular daily consumption of 4 standard drinks of either beer or red wine does not alter endothelial function, as measured by post-ischaemic flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery in healthy middle-aged men, nor was there evidence of any beneficial effect of de-alcoholised red wine on brachial artery response. As compliance with drinking protocol was confirmed with increased serum &#947;-GT and HDL during red wine and beer periods, and increased 24-hr urinary excretion of 4OMGA during red wine and de-alcoholised red wine periods, we are confident that there was excellent compliance with the beverage treatments. Study 2 also provides the first evidence from a carefully controlled intervention study that both red wine and beer elevate blood pressure to a similar degree, with no detectable difference in the magnitude of either treatment. As with endothelial function, there was also no evidence of any beneficial effect of de-alcoholised red wine on blood pressure. In addition, although post hoc analysis found evidence that alcohol increased both plasma homocysteine and urinary excretion of F2-isoprostane and endothelin-1, there was no apparent protective effect conferred from either red wine or de-alcoholised red wine on these cardiovascular risk markers. The results from this study cannot disprove the hypothesis that red wine is more beneficial for cardiovascular health; however, they suggest that if red wine has properties beyond those of beer to confer protection, they are not via any interactions with the nitric oxide regulatory function of the endothelium in conduit vessels nor are they via moderation of the vasopressor, homocysteine-raising, and oxidative stress effects of alcohol.  The interpretation of the findings from both intervention studies and their place in the context of our current understanding of the role that alcoholic beverages play in the development and/or prevention of cardiovascular disease are explored in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Beer -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Wine -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Alcoholic beverages</field><field name="subject">Endothelium</field><field name="subject">Brachial artery ultrasound</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Black snow by Michael Smetanin : an analysis : and original compositions</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Black Snow, an orchestral work composed by Michael Smetanin in 1987, was named after the book Black Snow by Mikhael Bulgakov. Newspaper articles, reviews and the literature researched, all comment on Smetanin&#8217;s style and on the influences that shaped that style. The aggressive and confrontational style of much of Smetanin&#8217;s music can be attributed partly to his love of rock music and jazz and partly to his mentor in the Netherlands, Louis Andriessen. The same sources quote other composers who also influenced Smetanin&#8217;s style. Three works in particular are named, that is, Trans by Stockhausen, Keqrops by Xenakis and De Tijd by Andriessen. It was decided, in the light of previous investigations into Smetanin&#8217;s music, to take one of these composers, namely Stockhausen and his work Trans, and discover how much Smetanin was influenced by this composer and this particular work. Trans was chosen because the similarities with Black Snow are less obvious. All aspects of Black Snow were examined - namely the harmony, rhythms, the important textures, serial/mathematical techniques, orchestration, the dramatic program, how the instruments are played - and then compared with Trans for similarities and differences. The results of the analytical investigation show that, while the internal organisation of the two works is very different, there are significant similarities between the two works in most of these areas. Serial/mathematical techniques could only be demonstrated in one area, and this is only conjecture.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smetanin, Michael. -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Stockhausen, Karlheinz, -- 1928- -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Stockhausen, Karlheinz, -- 1928- -- Influence</field><field name="subject">Orchestral music -- Australia -- 20th century -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Concertos (Clarinet, flute with string quartet) -- Scores</field><field name="subject">String quartets -- Scores</field><field name="subject">Orchestral music -- Scores</field><field name="subject">Instrumental music -- Scores</field><field name="subject">Clarinet and violoncello music -- Scores</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the prehospital utilisation of the Australasian Triage Scale</field><field name="creator">Sprivulis, Peter Carl</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background : Triage systems have evolved from battlefield casualty prioritisation tools to integral components of civilian emergency care systems over the last 50 years. There is significant variation in prehospital triage practices in Australia and little research has been undertaken to validate the triage systems used. There is considerable evidence to support the use of the Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) for triage in the emergency department setting and the ATS is used ubiquitously for emergency department triage in Australasia ... Conclusions : The findings of this thesis support integrating prehospital ATS allocations with emergency department triage processes. It is concluded that Paramedics apply the ATS similarly to nurses ... Allocations to ATS 1, 2 and 3 and most ATS 4 allocations by paramedics are valid when compared to nurse ATS allocations. Australasian Triage Scale category 5 is used inappropriately by paramedics and should be used rarely, if at all, by paramedics. The reliability of paramedic and nurse ATS allocations is sufficient to warrant a trial of the omission of retriage of ambulance presentations at Perth metropolitan emergency departments. However, early nursing assessment of a small proportion of ATS 3 patients may be required to ensure timely assessment for some mistriaged bone fide ATS 2 patients. Paramedic ATS allocations appear sufficiently reliable and valid to warrant a trial of their use as part of a two-tier trauma team activation system ... The implementation of standardised training between paramedics and nurses based on current Australasian College for Emergency Medicine guidelines is recommended. The implementation of paramedic triage audit, including comparison of paramedic ATS allocations with nurse ATS allocations may improve reliability between paramedics and nurses, and particularly the reliability of ATS 4 and ATS 5 allocations. Prehospital ATS allocations may prove useful in prehospital casemix analysis, the evaluation of prehospital service delivery and for prehospital research. Research opportunities include actual trials of the integration of prehospital use of ATS with emergency department triage and trauma system activation, and the evaluation of the ATS as a prehospital casemix and performance evaluation tool. Research into alternative triage tools to the ATS for use in the prehospital environment and into the impact of standardised triage training is also suggested.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Triage (Medicine) -- Australasia</field><field name="subject">Triage (Medicine) -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Emergency medical services -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Paramedic triage</field><field name="subject">Australasian Triage Scale</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of spatial point patterns using hierarchical clustering algorithms</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Sandra M.C.</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  This thesis is a new proposal for analysing spatial point patterns in spatial statistics using the outputs of popular techniques of (classical, non-spatial, multivariate) cluster analysis. The outputs of a chosen hierarchical algorithm, named fusion distances, are applied to investigate important spatial characteristics of a given point pattern. The fusion distances may be regarded as a missing link between the fields of spatial statistics and multivariate cluster analysis. Up to now, these two fields have remained rather separate because of fundamental differences in approach. It is shown that fusion distances are very good at discriminating different types of spatial point patterns. A detailed study on the power of the Monte Carlo test under the null hypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness (the benchmark of spatial statistics) against chosen alternative models is also conducted. For instance, the test (based on the fusion distance) is very powerful for some arbitrary values of the parameters of the alternative. A new general approach is developed for analysing a given point pattern using several graphical techniques for exploratory data analysis and inference. The new strategy is applied to univariate and multivariate point patterns. A new extension of a popular strategy in spatial statistics, named the analysis of the local configuration, is also developed. This new extension uses the fusion distances, and analyses a localised neighbourhood of a given point of the point pattern. New spatial summary function and statistics, named the fusion distance function H(t), area statistic A, statistic S, and spatial Rg index, are introduced, and proven to be useful tools for identifying relevant features of spatial point patterns. In conclusion, the new methodology using the outputs of hierarchical clustering algorithms can be considered as an essential complement to the existing approaches in spatial statistics literature.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="subject">Spatial point patterns</field><field name="subject">Fusion distances</field><field name="subject">Spatial clustering</field><field name="subject">Summary function</field><field name="subject">Cluster analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interplay between physical and chemical processes in the formation of world-class orogenic gold deposits in the Eastern Goldfields Province, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Hodkiewicz, Paul</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  The formation of world-class Archean orogenic gold deposits in the Eastern Goldfields Province of Western Australia was the result of a critical combination of physical and chemical processes that modified a single and widespread ore-fluid along fluid pathways and at the sites of gold deposition. Increased gold endowment in these deposits is associated with efficient regional-scale fluid focusing mechanisms and the influence of multiple ore-depositional processes at the deposit-scale. Measurement of the complexity of geologic features, as displayed in high-quality geologic maps of uniform data density, can be used to highlight areas that influence regional-scale hydrothermal fluid flow. Useful measurements of geological complexity include fractal dimensions of map patterns, density and orientation of faults and lithologic contacts, and proportions of rock types. Fractal dimensions of map patterns of lithologic contacts and faults highlight complexity gradients. Steep complexity gradients, between domains of high and low fractal dimensions within a greenstone belt, correspond to district-scale regions that have the potential to focus the flow of large volumes of hydrothermal fluid, which is critical for the formation of significant orogenic gold mineralization. Steep complexity gradients commonly occur in greenstone belts where thick sedimentary units overly more complex patterns of lithologic contacts, associated with mafic intrusive and mafic volcanic units. The sedimentary units in these areas potentially acted as seals to the hydrothermal Mineral Systems, which resulted in fluid-pressure gradients and increased fluid flow. The largest gold deposits in the Kalgoorlie Terrane and the Laverton Tectonic Zone occur at steep complexity gradients adjacent to thick sedimentary units, indicating the significance of these structural settings to gold endowment. Complexity gradients, as displayed in surface map patterns, are an indication of three-dimensional connectivity along fluid pathways, between fluid source areas and deposit locations. Systematic changes in the orientation of crustal-scale shear zones are also significant and measurable map features. The largest gold deposits along the Bardoc Tectonic Zone and Boulder-Lefroy Shear Zone, in the Eastern Goldfields Province, occur  where there are counter-clockwise changes in shear zone orientation, compared to the average orientation of the shear zone along its entire length. Sinistral movement along these shear zones resulted in the formation of district-scale dilational jogs and focused hydrothermal fluid-flow at the Golden Mile, New Celebration and Victory-Defiance deposits. Faults and lithologic contacts are the dominant fluid pathways in orogenic gold Mineral Systems, and measurements of the density of faults and contacts are also a method of quantifying the complexity of geologic map patterns on high-quality maps. Significantly higher densities of pathways in areas surrounding larger gold deposits are measurable within 20- and 5-kilometer search radii around them. Large variations in the sulfur isotopic composition of ore-related pyrites in orogenic gold deposits in the Eastern Goldfields Province are the result of different golddepositional mechanisms and the in-situ oxidation of a primary ore fluid in specific structural settings. Phase separation and wall-rock carbonation are potentially the most common mechanisms of ore-fluid oxidation and gold precipitation. The influence of multiple gold-depositional mechanisms increases the potential for significant ore-fluid oxidation, and more importantly, provides an effective means of increasing gold endowment. This explains the occurrence of negative &#948;34S values in ore-related pyrites in some world-class orogenic gold deposits. Sulfur isotopic compositions alone cannot uniquely define potential gold endowment. However, in combination with structural, hydrothermal alteration and fluid inclusion studies that also seek to identify multiple ore-forming processes, they can be a useful indicator. The structural setting of a deposit is also a potentially important factor controlling ore-fluid oxidation and the distribution of &#948;34S values in ore-related pyrites. At Victory-Defiance, the occurrence of negative &#948;34S(py) values in gently-dipping dilational structures, compared to more positive &#948;34S(py) values in steeply-dipping compressional structures, is potentially associated with different gold-depositional mechanisms that developed as a result of fluid-pressure fluctuations during different stages of the fault-valve cycle. During the pre-failure stage, when fluids are discharging from faults, fluid-rock interaction is the dominant gold-depositional mechanism. Phase separation and back-mixing of modified ore-fluid components are dominant during and immediately after faulting. Under appropriate conditions, any, or all, of these three mechanisms can oxidize orogenic gold fluids and cause gold deposition. The influence of multiple gold-depositional mechanisms during fault-valve cycles at dilational jogs, where fluid pressure fluctuations are interpreted to be most severe, can potentially explain both the large gold endowment of the giant to world-class Golden Mile, New Celebration and Victory-Defiance deposits along the Boulder-Lefroy Shear Zone, and the presence of gold-related pyrites with negative &#948;34S values in these deposits. This study highlights the interplay that exists between physical and chemical processes in orogenic gold Mineral Systems, during the transport of ore fluids in pathways from original fluid reservoirs to deposit sites. Potentially, a single and widespread orogenic ore-fluid could become oxidized, and lead to the formation of ore-related sulfides with variable sulfur isotopic compositions, depending on the nature and orientation of major fluid pathways, the nature of wall-rocks through which it circulates, and the precise ore-depositional processes that develop during fault-valve cycles.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Western Australia -- Eastern Goldfields</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Archaean</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- Western Australia -- Eastern Goldfields</field><field name="subject">Orogenic gold deposits</field><field name="subject">Yilgarn</field><field name="subject">Fractal dimensions</field><field name="subject">Sulfur isotopes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A radiological and biochemical perspective on ageing and degeneration of the human thoracic intervertebral disc</field><field name="creator">Tan, Celia I. C.</field><field name="description">Disc degenerative changes are directly or indirectly associated with spinal pain and disability. Literature revealed a high prevalence of disc degeneration in the thoracic region, however thoracic MRI degeneration trends and information on disc biochemical matrix constituents are limited for thoracic discs compared to lumbar and cervical discs. The objective of this thesis was to use MRI to investigate the prevalence of disc degenerative changes affecting the human thoracic spine, and to determine the factors affecting spinal disc biochemical matrix. A 3-point subjective MRI grading scale was used to grade the films. The feasibility of using archived formalin-fixed cadaver material was investigated to analyse collagen and elastin crosslinks. The prevalence of degenerative changes in human thoracic discs and vertebrae (T1 to T12) was determined retrospectively from an audit of 216 MRI cases, using sagittal T1- and T2-weighted MR images. In a subsequent series of ex-vivo studies, human thoracic discs and LF from 26 formalin-fixed and two fresh spines, involving all thoracic levels, were examined macroscopically to determine the degeneration status. Subsequently, disc and ligament tissues were analysed biochemically for collagen (pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline) and elastin (desmosine and isodesmosine) crosslinks. These crosslinks were extracted from hydrolysed samples by cellulose partition chromatography, and analysed by reverse-phase HPLC. Collagen content was determined using its hydroxyproline content, and proteoglycan content was assayed using a modified DMB assay for chondroitin sulphate. Finally the MRI and macroscopic assessments of thoracic discs, were compared with the biochemical data from two fresh cadaver thoracic spines. The 3-point MRI grading scale had a high inter- (k = 0.57 to 0.78) and intra-rater (k = 0.71 to 0.87) reliability. There were no significant differences in the collagen and elastin content and extent of collagen crosslinks between formalin fixed and unfixed ligament and disc tissues, after 25 weeks of formalin fixation. From the in-vivo MRI series of investigations (n = 216 MRI films), the prevalence of thoracic disc degenerative and vertebral morphological changes revealed significant age, gender and spinal level trends (p &lt; 0.05).Generally, males had a higher propensity for disc degeneration in contrast to females, especially older females, where the trend showed a higher prevalence of osteophytes and vertebral body changes. In particular, the mid and lower thoracic levels have a higher prevalence of degenerative changes, except for osteophytes and anterior vertebral wedging. With increased age, there was a concomitant increase in anterior wedging and bi-concavity and disc degenerative changes except for end-plates. The biochemical investigations on the ex-vivo series of formalin-fixed thoracic discs (n = 303) also revealed significant changes in the disc matrix due to degeneration status, age, gender and spinal regional factors. With increased age, normal disc matrices have significantly lower collagen content and extent of pyridinoline (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the degenerated disc matrix revealed significantly higher collagen content and extent of deoxypyridinoline (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that an altered matrix existed in normal ageing discs, which render the disc prone to injury and degeneration over the life span. The higher collagen and deoxypyridinoline in degenerated disc matrices reflects an increase in chondrocyte synthesis, and is also a novel finding, suggesting that they may be used as markers of ageing and degeneration processes. The biochemical investigations on another series of ex-vivo spinal LF tissues (n = 364), revealed that this had a lower collagen and pyridinoline, but significantly higher elastin and deoxypyridinoline compared to spinal discs (p &lt; 0.05). Elastin crosslinks however were difficult to detect in spinal discs, being present in negligible amounts in a few lumbar discs. The elastin crosslinks in the LF were not significantly affected by age, but were significantly higher in calcified, and female ligamentum tissues, and also in the lumbar region (p &lt; 0.05). These MRI prevalence findings enhanced our knowledge of vertebral body and disc degeneration trends in the thoracic region and contributed to the interpretation of MR images for pathology in the human thoracic spine. Information on the associated collagenous and elastic changes in the disc and ligamentum matrices provide original data and insight on the pathogenesis of degeneration in the disc matrix from a biochemical perspective, highlighting gender, age and spinal level influences on the matrix tensile strength and cellular synthetic activities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thoracic vertebrae -- Aging</field><field name="subject">Thoracic vertebrae -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Thoracic vertebrae -- Magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Degeneration (Pathology)</field><field name="subject">Spinal osteophytosis</field><field name="subject">Collagen</field><field name="subject">Elastin</field><field name="subject">Human thoracic intervertebral disc</field><field name="subject">Pyridinoline</field><field name="subject">Deoxypyridinoline</field><field name="subject">Human spinal ligamentum flavuum</field><field name="subject">Desmosine</field><field name="subject">Isodesmosine</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postprandial lipoprotein metabolism in patients at high risk of coronary artery disease : effects of statin therapy</field><field name="creator">Dane-Stewart, Cheryl Ann</field><field name="description">[Formulae and  special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Atherosclerosis is a common degenerative disease in which the clinical manifestations are often through stroke or myocardial infarction. Some of the established risk factors for atherosclerosis include elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM) and cigarette smoking. Of the risk factors, an elevation in plasma LDL is one of the most established and the most researched. This is partly a consequence of the deposition of cholesterol within arterial intima being a crucial step in the progression of atherosclerosis, combined with the finding that LDL particles are a major transporter of cholesterol in circulation. Recently there is increasing evidence showing a role of the other major transporter of cholesterol in circulation, chylomicron remnants, in the progression of atherosclerosis. The notion of atherosclerosis as a postprandial phenomenon has been further substantiated by the emergence of evidence showing a direct role of chylomicron remnants in arterial cholesterol deposition. Based on evidence that chylomicron remnants are proatherogenic, the suggestion arises that accumulation of postprandial lipoproteins in plasma may add another dimension of risk to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). This thesis tests the general hypothesis that individuals with or at high risk of CAD have postprandial dyslipidaemia and that this metabolic abnormality is correctable with a class of lipid-lowering drugs called statins. To test the hypothesis, clinical studies were conducted in normolipidaemic CAD patients, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. Determination of postprandial dyslipidaemia by comparison with control populations were conducted initially in each patient group (Studies 1, 3 and 5), followed by intervention studies investigating possible modulation of the dyslipidaemia with a statin (Studies 2, 4 and 6). Six observation statements based on case-control comparisons of postprandial lipaemia in patients with or at risk of CAD and the effects of statins on postprandial dyslipidaemia in the patient groups were derived from the general hypothesis. The observation statements were examined in the individual studies described below.  Postprandial lipoprotein metabolism was assessed using a number of methods. For comparison of postprandial lipaemia in Studies 1 and 2, a classic oral fat challenge was utilised. As markers of chylomicrons and chylomicron remnants, retinyl palmitate and triglyceride were measured postprandially as well as apolipoprotein (apo) B48 concentrations, a specific marker of intestinal lipoproteins. ApoB48 was also measured in the fasting state and found to predict the postprandial responses of retinyl palmitate, triglyceride and apoB48. This suggested that fasting measurement of apoB48 could be used as a simple indicator of postprandial dyslipidaemia. Consequently for Studies 3 - 6, fasting apoB48 measurements were used as primary markers of postprandial dyslipidaemia. Other markers for chylomicrons and their remnants utilised were fasting plasma concentrations of remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C) and apoC-III. As well as these static markers, chylomicron remnant catabolism was measured using a stable isotope breath test. The breath test involves the intravenous injection of a chylomicron remnant-like emulsion labelled with &#185;&#179;C-oleate and measurement of enriched &#185;&#179;CO2 in expired breath by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of the injected emulsion was subsequently calculated using multi-compartmental modeling (SAAM II). The studies are presented in this thesis as published and unpublished works. In Study 1, postprandial lipoprotein metabolism was compared between 18 normolipidaemic CAD patients (cholesterol 4.54 &#177; 0.12 mmol/L, triglyceride 1.09 &#177; 0.16) with 13 asymptomatic healthy controls using an oral fat challenge. Normolipidaemic CAD patients had higher postprandial area-under-curve (AUC) for triglyceride (+34%, p=0.019), retinyl palmitate (+74%, p=0.032) and apoB48 (+36%, p&lt;0.001). Fasting apoB48 was also higher (+41%, p=0.001) and found to correlate significantly with AUC of triglyceride (p=0.017), retinyl palmitate (p=0.001) and apoB48 (p&lt;0.001). The data suggest that normolipidaemic CAD patients have increased concentrations of intestinal lipoproteins in the fasting and postprandial state. In addition to these findings, significant correlations of fasting apoB48 with postprandial markers (p&lt;0.02) suggests the fasting marker to be a simpler surrogate marker for the degree of total postprandial lipaemia. Study 2 investigated the effect of atorvastatin treatment on postprandial dyslipidaemia found in the 18 near-normolipidaemic CAD patients from Study 1. The trial was conducted in a randomised, placebo-controlled design, using oral fat challenges before and after 12-weeks atorvastatin/placebo treatment. Compared with the placebo group, atorvastatin decreased the total postprandial AUC for iii triglyceride (-22%, p=0.05) and apoB48 (-34%, p=0.013). Fasting markers of apoB48 (-35%, p=0.019) and RLP-C (-36%, p=0.032) also decreased significantly. Atorvastatin was also found to increase LDL-receptor activity by +218% (p&lt;0.001) as reflected in binding studies. The data suggest atorvastatin reduces the fasting levels of intestinal lipoproteins as well as total postprandial lipaemia, but without acute dynamic changes in postprandial lipaemia. The reduction in fasting and total postprandial lipoprotein levels could be partly attributed to an increase in LDL-receptor mediated removal from circulation. In Study 3, postprandial lipaemia was compared in 15 heterozygous FH patients with 15 healthy controls. FH patients had higher fasting concentrations of apoB48 (+56%, p&lt;0.001) and RLP-C (+48%, p=0.003). The elevation in these fasting markers of chylomicrons and their remnants suggests FH patients have postprandial dyslipidaemia due to an accumulation of these particles in plasma. Study 4 examined the effects of long- (&gt; 6 months) and short-term (4 weeks) simvastatin treatment on modulating postprandial dyslipidaemia found in the 15 FH patients from Study 3. Short- and long-term simvastatin treatment decreased the fasting concentrations of apoB48 (-29% and 15% respectively, p&lt;0.05) and RLP-C (both -38%, p&lt;0.001), but did not significantly alter the FCR of the injected chylomicron remnant-like emulsion. The data suggest that in heterozygous FH both long- and short-term simvastatin treatments decrease the fasting markers of postprandial lipoproteins by mechanisms that may not be mediated via processes differentiated by the 13CO2 breath test. This implies that the effect on postprandial lipaemia may be from a decrease in production and/or a possible increase in catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). In Study 5, postprandial lipaemia was compared in 24 postmenopausal women age and body mass index matched with 14 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. Postmenopausal diabetic women were found to have higher fasting concentrations of apoB48 (+21%, p=0.021) and apoC-III (+16%, p=0.042) as well as lower FCR of the chylomicron remnant-like emulsion (-50%, p&lt;0.001). The data suggest that postmenopausal diabetic women have postprandial dyslipidaemia, and that this is due to delayed catabolism of chylomicron remnants. Study 6 was an hypothesis-generating exercise examining the effects of 4-weeks pravastatin treatment on postprandial dyslipidaemia found in 7 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM from Study 5. Although  plasma LDL-cholesterol was reduced (-19%, p=0.028), there were no significant effects found on fasting apoB48 concentrations (-12%, p=0.116) or the FCR of the chylomicron remnant-like emulsion (+38%, p=0.345). A larger sample size of patients and/or treatment with a more potent statin at a dosage known to affect chylomicron remnant metabolism would be required to demonstrate a significant reduction in postprandial dyslipidaemia in postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. The results of the above mentioned studies combined support the general hypothesis that postprandial dyslipidaemia is a feature of patients with or at risk of CAD. This defect may be demonstrated using fasting apoB48 as an indicator of the degree of postprandial lipaemia. Postprandial dyslipidaemia may reflect a reduction in catabolism, as suggested with the breath test in type 2 DM, and/or an over overproduction of chylomicrons. Both these mechanisms would also increase competition for lipolysis and clearance pathways between hepatically and intestinally-derived lipoproteins. The exact mechanisms by which postprandial dyslipidaemia occurs are yet to be determined. Statins appear to improve defective postprandial lipaemia in patients with or at risk of CAD, which is in agreement with the general hypothesis. The effectiveness of a statin is dependant on their potency in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and increasing receptor mediated clearance of LDL and chylomicron remnants. The studies conducted in this thesis show that postprandial dyslipidaemia can be reduced by statins but not to the extent demonstrated in controls. However, the demonstrated reduction in fasting and total postprandial lipaemia translates to a lowering in overall arterial exposure to circulating proatherogenic particles. The elevation in fasting and postprandial levels of proatherogenic chylomicron remnants found in the patient groups described in this thesis indicates another dimension to their risk of coronary disease. The reductions in the overall levels of proatherogenic particles in patients with or at high CAD risk, infers a possible reduction in the risk of coronary disease in these patients.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipoproteins -- Metabolism -- Disorders</field><field name="subject">Statins (Cardiovascular agents)</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Chylomicron</field><field name="subject">Chylomicron remnant</field><field name="subject">Postprandial</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shear-slip induced seismic activity in underground mines : a case study in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Reimnitz, Marc</field><field name="description">Mining induced seismic activity and rockbursting are critical concerns for many underground operations. Seismic activity may arise from the crushing of highly stressed volumes of rock around mine openings or from shear motion on planes of weakness. Shear-slip on major planes of weakness such as faults, shear zones and weak contacts has long been recognized as a dominant mode of failure in underground mines. In certain circumstances, it can generate large seismic events and induce substantial damage to mine openings. The Big Bell Gold mine began experiencing major seismic activity and resultant damage in 1999. Several seismic events were recorded around the second graphitic shear between April 2000 and February 2002. It is likely that the seismic activity occurred as a result of the low strength of the shear structure combined with the high level of mining induced stresses. The stability of the second graphitic shear was examined in order to gain a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms of the seismic activity recorded in the vicinity of the shear structure as mining advanced. The data were derived from the observation of the structure exposures, numerical modelling and seismic monitoring. The numerical modelling predictions and the interpreted seismic monitoring data were subsequently compared in order to identify potential relationships between the two. This thesis proposes the Incremental Work Density (IWD) as a measure to evaluate the relative likelihood of shear-slip induced seismic activity upon major planes of weakness. IWD is readily evaluated using numerical modelling and is calculated as the product of the average driving shear stress and change in inelastic shear deformation during a given mining increment or step. IWD is expected to correlate with shear-slip induced seismic activity in both space and time. In this thesis, IWD was applied to the case study of the second graphitic shear at the Big Bell mine. Exposures of the second graphitic shear yielded information about the physical characteristics of the structure and location within the mine. Numerical modelling was used to examine the influence of mining induced stresses on the overall behaviour of the shear structure. A multi-step model of the mine was created using the three- dimensional boundary element code of Map3D. The shear structure was physically incorporated into the model in order to simulate inelastic shear deformation. An elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb material model was used to describe the structure behaviour. The structure plane was divided into several elements in order to allow for the comparison of the numerical modelling predictions and the interpreted seismic data. Stress components, deformation components and IWD values were calculated for each element of the shear structure and each mining step. The seismic activity recorded in the vicinity of the second graphitic shear was back analysed. The seismic data were also gridded and smoothed. Gridding and smoothing of individual seismic moment and seismic energy values resulted in the definition of indicators of seismic activity for each element and mining step. The numerical model predicted inelastic shear deformation upon the second graphitic shear as mining advanced. The distribution of modelled IWD suggested that shear deformation was most likely seismic upon a zone below the stopes and most likely aseismic upon the upper zone of the shear structure. The distribution of seismic activity recorded in the vicinity of the shear structure verified the above predictions. The seismic events predominantly clustered upon the zone below the stopes. The results indicated that the seismic activity recorded in the vicinity of the second graphitic shear was most likely related to both the change in inelastic shear deformation and the level of driving shear stress during mechanical shearing. Time distribution of the seismic events also indicated that shear deformation and accompanying seismic activity were strongly influenced by mining and were time-dependant. Seismic activity in the vicinity of the second graphitic shear occurred as a result of the overall inelastic shear deformation of the shear structure under mining induced stresses. A satisfactory relationship was found between the spatial distribution of modelled IWD upon the shear structure and the spatial distribution of interpreted seismic activity (measured as either smoothed seismic moment or smoothed seismic energy). Seismic activity predominantly clustered around a zone of higher IWD upon the second graphitic shear as mining advanced. However, no significant statistical relationship was found between the modelled IWD and the interpreted seismic activity. The lack of statistical relationship between the modelled and seismic data may be attributed to several factors including the limitations of the techniques employed (e.g. Map3D modelling, seismic monitoring) and the complexity of the process involved.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Gold mines and mining -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Seismic activity</field><field name="subject">Seismic monitoring</field><field name="subject">Numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">Shear slip</field><field name="subject">Planes of weakness</field><field name="subject">Geological structures</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The complexities of farce : with a case study on Fawlty Towers</field><field name="creator">Dalla Costa, Dario</field><field name="description">This thesis will counter the argument that farce is a simplistic dramatic form low in the theatrical hierarchy and demonstrate that it is both complex and multifaceted. It will be shown to have a long history and to have influenced many different dramatic forms. The thesis is in two sections. The first will explore farce in general, and the second will use the sitcom Fawlty Towers as a case study in order to explore the televisual mode and its relevance to the contemporary context. The question &#8220;What is farce?&#8221; will be answered in detail, thus developing an unambiguous perception of the genre which will form a contextual basis for the rest of the thesis. Recurring themes will be used to link chapters together and certain issues raised in early chapters will be expanded upon in later ones. A key aspect to be taken into consideration is the importance the physical plays in farce. Thus, my focus will be specifically on performance texts, and not limit itself to the &#8220;literary&#8221; texts. The theatrical hierarchy will be addressed directly, exploring why and how the genre has been delegated to the lowest rung of the hierarchical ladder. Such a classification will be destabilised and shown to be unfounded because it is based on such assumptions as tragedy being the &#8220;best&#8221; genre because it is tragedy, and farce the worst because it is farce. The conclusions made in this section will then be demonstrated by approaching farce in a more oblique manner through an exploration of Commedia dell&#8217;Arte and Medieval Carnival. This will reveal the extent to which farce and/or its techniques have manifested themselves. Fawlty Towers will be introduced to determine how farce has translated to the televisual medium. Fawlty Towers is useful because, unlike the &#8220;literary texts&#8221; studied earlier, its recordings provide visual/aural examples which are more practical in exploring farce&#8217;s physical characteristics. The farcical aspects of Commedia and Carnival will be re-explored to show how they have evolved and manifested themselves in the sitcom form. Integral to the thesis is a study on laughter. Various laughter theories will be studied in relation to Fawlty Towers to establish that, like farce, laughter is also a complicated subject matter worthy of study. Through association, farce is shown to be even more complex. The thesis concludes with an analysis of the Fawlty Towers performance text to illustrate farce&#8217;s multifaceted nature, and that it can, and should, be taken &#8220;seriously&#8221;. The series&#8217; &#8220;closed world&#8221; will be examined to discover how it ideally suits the farcical paradigm. Then, using Victorian beliefs and ethics as a contextual base, I explore how farce parodies this outdated value system as it is played out  anachronistically  through the character of Basil Fawlty. The thesis terminates with a brief conclusion summing up what was analysed, while affirming that the premise proposed in the introduction has been achieved.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Farce</field><field name="subject">Laughter</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magmatic-hydrothermal architecture of the Archean Volcanic Massive Sulfide (VMS) System at Panorama, Pilbara, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Drieberg, Susan L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of this abstract for an accurate representation.] The 3.24 Ga Panorama VMS District, located in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia, is exposed as a cross-section through subvolcanic granite intrusions and a coeval submarine volcanic sequence that hosts Zn-Cu mineralization. The near-complete exposure across the district, the very low metamorphic grade, and the remarkable preservation of primary igneous and volcanic textures provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine the P-T-X-source evolution of a VMS ore-forming system and to assess the role of the subvolcanic intrusions as heat sources and/or metal contributors to the overlying VMS hydrothermal system. Detailed mapping of the Panorama VMS District has revealed seven major vein types related to the VMS hydrothermal system or to the subvolcanic intrusions. (1) Quartz-chalcopyrite veins, hosted in granophyric granite immediately beneath the granite-volcanic contact, formed prior to main stage VMS hydrothermal convection, and were precipitated from mixed H2OCO 2-NaCl-KCl fluids with variable salinities (2.5 to 8.5 wt% NaCl equiv). (2) Quartz-sericite veins, ubiquitous across the top 50m of the volcanic sequence, were formed from an Archean seawater with a salinity of 9.7 to 11.2 wt% NaCl equiv at temperatures of 90&#176; to 135&#176;C. These veins formed synchronous with the regional feldspar-sericite-quartz-ankerite alteration during seawater recharge into the main stage VMS hydrothermal convection cells. (3) Quartz-pyrite veins hosted in granophyric granite, and (4) quartz-carbonate-pyrite veins hosted in andesitebasalt, also formed from relatively unevolved Archean seawater (5.5 to 10.1 wt% NaCl equiv; 150&#176; to 225&#176;C), but during the collapse of the VMS hydrothermal system when cool, unmodified seawater invaded the top of the subvolcanic intrusions. (5) Quartz-topaz-muscovite greisen, (6) quartz-chlorite-chalcopyrite vein greisen, and (7) hydrothermal Cu-Zn-Sn veins are hosted in the subvolcanic intrusions. Primary H2O-NaCl-CaCl2 fluid inclusions in the vein greisens were complex high temperature hypersaline inclusions (up to 590&#176;C and up to 56 wt% NaCl equiv). The H2O-CO2-NaCl fluid inclusions in the Cu-Zn-Sn veins have variable salinities, ranging from 4.9 to 14.1 wt% NaCl equiv, and homogenization temperatures ranging from 160&#176; to 325&#176;C. The hydrothermal quartz veins and magmatic metasomatic phases in the subvolcanic intrusions were formed from a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid that had evolved through wallrock reactions, cooling, and finally mixing with seawater-derived VMS hydrothermal fluids.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formations (Geology) -- Western Australia -- Pilbara Region</field><field name="subject">Hydrothermal deposits -- Western Australia -- Pilbara Region</field><field name="subject">Mineralogy -- Western Australia -- Pilbara Region</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Archaean</field><field name="subject">VMS</field><field name="subject">Archean</field><field name="subject">Volcanic massive sulfide</field><field name="subject">Fluid inclusion</field><field name="subject">Volcanogenic massive sulfide</field><field name="subject">Stable isotope</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1) : effects of glycerol and identification of the membrane binding domain</field><field name="creator">Headlam, Madeleine Joyce</field><field name="description">The first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones occurs in the mitochondria where cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by cytochrome P450scc (CYP11A1). Cholesterol is insoluble in water and is supplied to the CYP11A1 directly from the inner mitochondrial membrane to which the enzyme is bound. The aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of bovine CYP11A1 with the phospholipid membrane. The effect of osmotic stress provided by glycerol on the spin-state, activity and degree of hydration of CYP11A1 was also investigated. Multiple sequence alignment of mitochondrial P450s revealed that there are 46 absolutely conserved residues, with the highest conservation in the heme-binding region at the C-terminal. The greatest variablility between subfamilies is in the regions believed to be involved in substrate binding (SRSs), as defined for the CYP2B family. The secondary structure prediction for CYP11A1 suggests that there is strong similarity in secondary structure to P450s of known structure. A model structure of CYP11A1 was built from primary sequence alignment to template P450 structures using the SwissModel automated server. From the model and other bioinformatic analyses, the distal face of the P450 which includes the A&#8217; helix, F-G loop and beta sheet 1 regions, were predicted to interact with the membrane. Tryptic digests of CYP11A1 were performed with the aim of identifying membrane bound peptides that may be protected from protease activity. HPLC tryptic maps were similar in profile between soluble and vesicle-bound P450 which suggests that there is not a large region of CYP11A1 protected from protease digestion when the enzyme is attached to a membrane. Mass spectrometric analysis of peptides resulting from tryptic digestion revealed a number of peptides in the soluble digest that were not present in the digest of vesicle-bound P450.  These peptides were located at the N-terminal and the J to J&#8217; helix and interestingly, there was an absence of C-terminal peptides for both digests. This C-terminal peptide could be detected in digests of vesicle-bound P450 but not in digests of soluble P450 by tricine SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western transfer and N-terminal sequence analysis. Based upon the bioinfomatic and tryptic digestion data, a set of N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of CYP11A1 were expressed in E. coli and fractionated based on their association with the soluble or membrane fraction of the cells. The N-terminal deletion of the A&#8217; helix resulted in an increase in the proportion of CYP11A1 in the soluble fraction while the C-terminal deletion did not alter membrane localisation. There are eight tryptophan residues in mature CYP11A1. The accessibility of these tryptophans to a water-soluble fluorescence quencher was determined for soluble and vesicle-bound enzyme. When CYP11A1 was associated with the vesicle membrane an average of 2 tryptophan residues were protected from quenching compared to soluble CYP11A1. This suggests that these tryptophan residues become buried within the membrane following association of CYP11A1 with the vesicles and are no longer accessible to quencher. The only free cysteine (C265S) of bovine CYP11A1 was removed by site directed mutagenesis and new cysteine residues introduced at selected sites based upon earlier results and the modelled CYP11A1 structure. The cysteine mutants were expressed, purified and labelled with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxal-3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (NBD). There was an increase in the hydrophobicity of the NBD environment following the association of CYP11A1 with vesicles for the labeled mutants V212C and L219C. This indicates that these residues which are in the F-G loop, become localized to a more hydrophobic environment following membrane binding. Labeled cysteine residues introduced into the A&#8217;, B&#8217; and G helices and &#946;4-2 did not show major changes in hydrophobicity following membrane integration of CYP11A1. Osmotic stress of CYP11A1 induced by glycerol resulted in a low-spin spectral response and inhibition of activity. The change to low spin correlated with the dissociation of five or six water molecules from CYP11A1 and the inhibition of activity with cholesterol as substrate correlated with the dissociation of two molecules of water. In conclusion, this study shows that CYP11A1 is held to the membrane, at least in part, by the F-G loop region, and that the removal of water from the active site of CYP11A1 by osmotic stress causes a low spin spectral response and inhibition of activity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">Glycerin</field><field name="subject">Lipid membranes</field><field name="subject">CYP11A1</field><field name="subject">Pregnenolone</field><field name="subject">Membrane interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory of mind and executive function impairments in autism spectrum disorders and their broader phenotype : profile, primacy and independence</field><field name="creator">Wong, Dana</field><field name="description">Impairments in both theory of mind (ToM; the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others) and executive function (EF; a group of high-level cognitive functions which help guide and control goal-directed behaviour) have been demonstrated in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Both deficits have been proposed by different groups of researchers as being the single primary cognitive deficit of autism, which can subsume the other deficit as secondary or artefactual. However, few studies have examined the nature of the relationship between ToM and EF in ASDs or conducted a systematic investigation of their relative primacy. This research principally sought to establish the primacy and independence of impairments in ToM and EF in ASDs and thereby evaluate the validity of single versus multiple primary deficit models of autism. These aims were addressed in two studies, both broad in scope. The first study was an investigation of the profile, primacy, and independence of ToM and EF impairments in individuals with ASDs. The sample included 46 participants with ASDs and 48 control participants matched on age and non-verbal ability. The profile of impairments was examined by measuring ToM and a range of EF components using tasks employing, wherever possible, process-pure indices of performance. Primacy was measured by focussing on i) whether or not the deficits observed were universal among individuals with ASDs; ii) whether the deficits were able to discriminate individuals with ASDs from matched controls (i.e., predict group membership); and iii) the ability of ToM and EF deficits to explain the full range of autistic symptomatology, as measured by correlating cognitive performances with behavioural indices. The relationship between ToM and EF impairments was investigated by conducting correlations between ToM and EF variables as well as analysing the incidence of dissociations between impairments in the two domains. The ASD group was found to demonstrate significant impairments in ToM and several components of EF including planning, verbal inhibition, working memory (in a context where inhibitory control was required), and both verbal and non-verbal generativity. However, neither ToM nor EF impairments were able to meet all of the criteria for a primary deficit in ASDs. EF deficits were found to be more primary, but could not account for ToM as a secondary deficit, as ToM and EF were found to be independent (i.e., uncorrelated and dissociable) deficits in the ASD group. This pattern of results suggested that a multiple deficits model involving at least two independent impairments appeared to best characterise ASDs, but the data were compatible with several variants of such a model (e.g., involving distinct subtypes versus a multidimensional spectrum). The second study was an investigation of ToM and EF impairments in siblings of individuals with ASDs, who have previously been found to demonstrate a subclinical &#8220;broad autism phenotype&#8221;. The main aims of this study were i) to identify whether ToM or EF deficits could meet criteria for an &#8220;endophenotype&#8221; or vulnerability marker for the autism genotype in unaffected relatives, which would have further implications about the primacy of ToM and EF in ASDs; and ii) to further investigate the validity of various multiple deficits models of ASDs by examining the pattern of ToM and EF performance in those showing the broad phenotype. Participants were 108 siblings of individuals with ASDs and 67 siblings of controls, tested on the same ToM and EF tasks used in the first study. Confirming the superior primacy of EF deficits found in Study One, there was no significant difference in ToM performance between ASD and control siblings, but ASD siblings showed weaknesses on two measures of EF. Furthermore, there appeared to be different subgroups of siblings demonstrating different cognitive profiles, consistent with the heterogeneity evident in the first study. This research indicated that ASDs cannot be explained by a single primary cognitive deficit. These findings hold important theoretical and empirical implications and highlight further questions about which type of multiple deficits model might best explain ASDs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autism -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of mind</field><field name="subject">Theory of mind</field><field name="subject">Executive function</field><field name="subject">Broad autism phenotype</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial and temporal variability of nearshore currents</field><field name="creator">Johnson, David</field><field name="description">The nearshore current field, defined here as the residual horizontal flow after averaging over the incident wave period, exhibits variability at a range of time and space scales. Some of the variable currents are low frequency gravity wave motions. However, variable, rotational (in the sense of possessing vertical vorticity) flow can also exist as part of the overall nearshore current field. A field and numerical modelling investigation of these variable rotational currents has been carried out.  Drifters, which were developed for surfzone use, enabled measurement of the nearshore current structure; the design and testing of these new instruments is described. Two sets of field measurements, using the new drifters and Eulerian instruments were carried out for conditions with swell perpendicular to a plane beach and in strong longshore currents. In the perpendicular swell conditions, an interesting and well-defined feature of the measured trajectories was the development of transient rip currents. Discrete vortices were also observed. In the longshore current case, trajectories with the longshore current displacement removed had complex meandering paths. Lagrangian data were used to make estimates of length scales and dispersion, both of which provide strong evidence that the current field cannot be due to low frequency gravity waves alone. Under the assumption of equipartition of kinetic and potential energy for low frequency gravity waves, Eulerian measurements of velocities and pressure show significant energy due to non-divergent, rotational flow in both the perpendicular swell and longshore current case.  A numerical model that can simulate horizontal flow with a directionally spread, random wave field incident on a plane beach was implemented. The model developed transient rip currents that are qualitatively very similar to those seen in the drifter trajectories from the field. The number and intensity of rip currents in the model depended on the beach slope and incident wave spectra. The energy content and cross-shore flux (and hence transport of material) of the rotational current flow component in the simulated flow fields is comparable to that due to low frequency gravity waves. The modelling also provided some evidence that there may be universal characteristics of the rotational currents.  The field results and modelling show that variable rotational currents are ubiquitous in the field even when longshore currents and hence shear waves are not present. The term &#8220;infragravity turbulence&#8221; is suggested to describe the general class of nearshore hydrodynamics not directly associated with shear waves, which is largely disorganised, but contains well defined features such as transient rips currents and large scale horizontal vortices. The results have important implications in the understanding of the transport of material, including sediment, biological material, pollution, and sometimes bathers, in the nearshore zone.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean currents</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Nearshore currents</field><field name="subject">Surf zone</field><field name="subject">Rip currents</field><field name="subject">Drifters</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology and fishery of Roe's abalone Haliotis roei Gray in south-western Australia, with emphasis on the Perth fishery</field><field name="creator">Hancock, Andrew (Boze) T.</field><field name="description">The Roe&#8217;s abalone (Haliotis roei) fishery near Perth, Western Australia, is uniquely accessible, and highly vulnerable to overexploitation. The sustainability of this intensively utilized fishery requires robust assessment. To facilitate an assessment, this research aimed to provide rigorous and detailed biological information with appropriate interpretation. Four critical aspects of the species&#8217; biology and population dynamics were investigated: (1) the stock structure; (2) the recreational catch; (3) an appropriate growth curve and description of size at age; and (4) abundance measures against which to assess the impact of fishing mortality. Allozyme electrophoresis was used to investigate stock structure across the species&#8217; distribution. Standardized variance in allelic frequencies between 10 sites in south-western Australia indicated high levels of gene flow across the 3000 km sampled (mean FST = 0.009). An isolation-by-distance was evident when pairwise measures of GST were related to geographic distance (r=0.45, P&lt;0.001). The area of complete genetic mixing was estimated from samples within the Perth fishery to be less than the distance between the two nearest sites, or 13 km. Consequently, the Perth fishery comprises numerous discrete stocks, each requiring independent assessment. A possible mechanism for this population structure is the retention of larvae in the wind driven currents oscillating in the near-shore lagoons, with rare pulses of long distance dispersal via the southerly Leeuwin current, running further offshore. The presumed impact of intensive recreational fishing, combined with substantial commercial quotas for the Perth fishery, had led to tight restrictions on fishing effort, without any quantitative measure of the recreational catch. A stratified creel survey was adapted to estimate the effort, catch rate and mean weight of abalone harvested by the recreational sector. Catches were estimated for reef complexes, or stocks, of less than 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) of coast. Between 1997 and 2000 the recreational catch varied from 30 to 45 tonnes whole weight, approximately equivalent to the commercial quota of 36 tonnes. On average 88% of the recreational catch came from two stocks, while 98% of the commercial catch came from these two, and one additional, stocks. The incidental mortality from recreational fishing, measured as the number of abalone left dead on the reef as a proportion of the estimated catch, was approximately 7% and 20% at two sites surveyed. Spatial and temporal patterns of growth were examined on the west coast of Western Australia. Growth increments were measured for abalone larger than about 30 mm from tagging studies at five sites in the Perth fishery, a site at the northern extent of the species&#8217; distribution and a site in the southwest. Mean annual growth increments of the 0+ year class were obtained by fitting components to length frequencies from five sites in the Perth fishery, and combined with growth increments from each Perth tag site for model fitting. A von Bertalanffy growth curve provided a slightly better fit to the tag data, but a Gompertz growth curve was a much better fit when the mean increment from the 0+ to 1+ cohort was included, with the inflection occurring at about 40 mm, the size at sexual maturity. There was no difference in annual growth between the two years studied. There was significant variation in growth between the reef platform and adjacent sub-tidal reef, but this variation was site specific and faster growth rates were not consistently associated with either habitat. There was no latitudinal trend in growth rate. Growth at the Perth sites was the fastest and similar at all five sites with growth increments greater in summer than in winter. Size and abundance of abalone were measured using fixed transects and quadrats. Abalone densities were highest on the outer edge of the platform, intermediate in the middle of the reef platform, and lowest on both the inner platform and the sub-tidal reef. The pattern of mean lengths of abalone was the inverse of the density. Mean length and abundance were driven by the presence of post-settlement juveniles on the outer and middle reef habitats. There was a high spatial variation in abundance, with densities varying between transects at the same site, but the trend between years for each transect at a site was not significantly different. Abalone abundances, by size class, were examined from sites sampled between 1996 and 2002. A low density of post-settlement juveniles at all sites in 1997 was reflected in low densities of the 1+ and 2+ year classes in subsequent years. Abalone abundances at an unfished site were steady over the seven years. Two sites were located within each of the main stocks utilised by the recreational fishery. Abundance was stable or increasing in one stock, corresponding to a stable total catch. In the second stock the total catch increased over time and abundances declined. Perth is the focus of the Roe&#8217;s abalone fishery, with recreational and commercial fishers take about equal shares of the annual catch. Stocks are highly subdivided, with most of this catch coming from only 3 stocks occupying about 20 nautical miles of coast. Growth rates were found to be lower than previous estimates, and more similar to other commercial species of abalone. All life history stages are highly habitat specific, particularly the recruits, and the distribution and abundance through time indicate that the main stocks are near, or slightly over, the limit of sustainable fishing.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abalones -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Abalone fisheries -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Population biology -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Fish populations -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Roe's abalone</field><field name="subject">Haliotis roei</field><field name="subject">Recreational catch</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Stock assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying statistical and syntactic pattern recognition techniques to the detection of fish in digital images</field><field name="creator">Hill, Evelyn June</field><field name="description">This study is an attempt to simulate aspects of human visual perception by automating the detection of specific types of objects in digital images. The success of the methods attempted here was measured by how well results of experiments corresponded to what a typical human&#8217;s assessment of the data might be. The subject of the study was images of live fish taken underwater by digital video or digital still cameras. It is desirable to be able to automate the processing of such data for efficient stock assessment for fisheries management. In this study some well known statistical pattern classification techniques were tested and new syntactical/ structural pattern recognition techniques were developed. For testing of statistical pattern classification, the pixels belonging to fish were separated from the background pixels and the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models was used to locate clusters of pixels. The means and the covariance matrices for the components of the model were used to indicate the location, size and shape of the clusters. Because the number of components in the mixture is unknown, the EM algorithm has to be run a number of times with different numbers of components and then the best model chosen using a model selection criterion. The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and the MDL (Minimum Description Length) were tested.The MDL was found to estimate the numbers of clusters of pixels more accurately than the AIC, which tended to overestimate cluster numbers. In order to reduce problems caused by initialisation of the EM algorithm (i.e. starting positions of mixtures and number of mixtures), the Dynamic Cluster Finding algorithm (DCF) was developed (based on the Dog-Rabbit strategy). This algorithm can produce an estimate of the locations and numbers of clusters of pixels. The Dog-Rabbit strategy is based on early studies of learning behaviour in neurons. The main difference between Dog-Rabbit and DCF is that DCF is based on a toroidal topology which removes the tendency of cluster locators to migrate to the centre of mass of the data set and miss clusters near the edges of the image. In the second approach to the problem, data was extracted from the image using an edge detector. The edges from a reference object were compared with the edges from a new image to determine if the object occurred in the new image. In order to compare edges, the edge pixels were first assembled into curves using an UpWrite procedure; then the curves were smoothed by fitting parametric cubic polynomials. Finally the curves were converted to arrays of numbers which represented the signed curvature of the curves at regular intervals. Sets of curves from different images can be compared by comparing the arrays of signed curvature values, as well as the relative orientations and locations of the curves. Discrepancy values were calculated to indicate how well curves and sets of curves matched the reference object. The total length of all matched curves was used to indicate what fraction of the reference object was found in the new image. The curve matching procedure gave results which corresponded well with what a human being being might observe.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fish stock assessment -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Image analysis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Optical pattern recognition -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition systems</field><field name="subject">Clusters</field><field name="subject">Curvature</field><field name="subject">Model selection</field><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two studies of the Australian Wheat Board : a traditional price discrimination model, and the privatisation process and pricing behaviour of a risk averse firm</field><field name="creator">Lobb, Alexandra E.</field><field name="description">This thesis is motivated by the impacts of contemporary political and economic issues such as microeconomic reform and regulatory control on the Australian wheat industry. Firstly, the suggestion of whether the AWB (International) Ltd commands market power and secondly, that the objectives of the AWB Ltd have changed since semi-privatisation of the Australian Wheat Board under the Wheat Marketing Act, 1989. The AWB (International) Ltd&#8217;s ability to price discriminate is a key component to the retention of the single desk regulatory arrangement for the export of Australian wheat. Due to data restrictions the market power of the AWB (International) Ltd has not been determined within this thesis. To complement this traditional approach, a more novel proposal is developed to determine the effect of microeconomic reform on the Australian wheat industry. Conceptualising the change of the AWB Ltd&#8217;s objectives as a shift from revenue maximization to profit maximization, this study examines the impact of such a change on the pricing policies of a multi- market price-setting firm. More specifically, this study investigates, for two hypothetical objective functions, a risk averse firm&#8217;s price-setting behaviour in an &#8220;overseas&#8221; and a &#8220;domestic&#8221; market, given differing costs of supply, uncertain demand functions and differing price elasticities of demand in each market.

A re-interpretation of a standard technique, non-maxima suppression for corner detectors was attempted. In addition, a thinning filter, Hall-Guo, was modified to achieve better results.

AD is characterised by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and congophillic amyloid angiopathy in the brain tissue of affected individuals. Of these neuropathological features the extracellular amyloid plaques are the most characteristic containing a peptide termed amyloid- beta (A&#946;); the major protein component of these structures. In addition a number of genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. Of these the &#949;4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene found on chromosome 19 is considered to be the main genetic risk factor attributing to about 40-60% of all AD cases in most populations. Although there is strong evidence that genetic risk factors play an important role in AD they do not actually trigger the disease process. Deficits in memory and learning are the most common clinical signs of AD in the initial stages of the disease. Neuropsychological tests such as the CAMCOG and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) are important diagnostic tools used for the assessment of cognition. The CAMCOG is an accurate and efficient measure of global cognitive ability, while the CVLT is more specific to areas of cognition influenced in the early stages of the disease such as verbal memory. Substantial evidence indicates that changes in sex hormones following menopause in women are important factors in AD. Specifically, the reduced levels of oestrogen in post-menopausal women have been linked to cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. In addition the elevated level of the gonadotropins, a characteristic of the post-menopausal period, have been implicated with the disease. Numerous nonhormonal factors such as age and education may also be associated with the development and progression of cognitive decline.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders -- Endocrine aspects</field><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="subject">Post-menopausal women</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of land-use change on phosphorus forms in South-West Australian soils</field><field name="creator">George, Suman Jacob</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Eleven sites, each with the trio of land uses: Eucalyptus globulus plantation, pasture and natural vegetation, representing from the Mediterranean climate, high rainfall region (&lt;550 mm annually) of south-western Australia were investigated to assess medium-term changes in the P-supplying capacity of soils in eucalypt plantations growing on agricultural land. The natural vegetation soils were a benchmark for comparing soil P change since land clearing and development for agriculture. The experimental framework provided an ideal basis for studying changes in P forms since land clearing and fertilization for agriculture and the ensuing conversion to plantations (on an average 9 years ago). Conventional soil P indices measure plant available P that is more relevant to short duration annual crops and pastures. To predict medium-term P availability, P forms were determined using Hedley et al.&#8217;s (1982) fractionation scheme and fractions were grouped using the Guo and Youst (1998) criteria into readily, moderately and sparingly available P. The P species were also determined by 31P NMR spectroscopy of 0.5M NaOH-0.1M EDTA extracts. Hedley et al.&#8217;s (1982) inorganic P extracted by anion exchange resin and by NaHCO3 are widely considered to be approximations to the actual plant available P. The availability to plants of other P fractions is less certain and this is examined in an experiment to compare the plant availability of various P fractions in soils from fertilized and unfertilized land uses following exhaustive cropping in the glasshouse. The soil texture for the sites studied included coarse sand, loamy sand, clayey sand, and sandy loam. Surface soils (0-10 cm) have pH(CaCl2) in the acidic range (mean 4.4) and there is no significant difference due to differences in land use (P&lt;0.05). The soils are of low EC (1:5 H2O) - 6 mS m-1. There is an almost 5-fold variation in organic C among sites (from 1.4% to 8%) but organic C values did not show any significant effect (P&lt;0.05) of changes in land use. To evaluate the degree of similarity of soils within each triplet set at a site principal component analysis was carried out on those soil chemical&#8260;mineralogical characteristics that were least likely to be affected by changes in land use practices. This analysis showed good matching of the triplet of sub-sites on the whole, especially for the duo of pasture and plantation land uses.

This thesis will examine the role of beliefs about self and others in social anxiety/phobia; specifically, how people high and low on social anxiety/phobia evaluate themselves (private self-referent representations), how they believe they are evaluated by others (public self-referent representations) and how they evaluate other people (other-referent representations).

Five studies addressed this issue by assessing these representations in people high and low on social anxiety/phobia. Previous investigations of the above representations have mostly employed self-report measures, which suffer from serious limitations. The current research employs both self-report measures and performance-based measures to provide a picture of explicit and implicit beliefs or representations about self, about other people and about how people think they are viewed by others.

Despite this, there is little understanding of the physiological and pathological processes occurring before, during and following mastitis. In this study 26 women who, on the basis of my previous research, were assessed to be at risk for developing mastitis, were recruited during the first week post partum and followed prospectively throughout the course of their lactation. Breastmilk, and 24 hour urine samples were collected at Days 5, 14, 30, 60 and 90 post partum and blood was collected at Days 5 and 14 post partum. If participants experienced inflammation of the breast at any time, either during the 90 day reference sampling period or later in their lactation, samples were then collected daily for the duration of symptoms and then, as a follow up, again one week following resolution of symptoms. Breastmilk samples were analysed for a range of biochemical components that reflect immunological (sIgA, lactoferrin) and acute phase (C-reactive protein) response, synthetic activity (lactose, glucose), and permeability of the paracellular pathway (sodium, chloride, lactose and serum albumin) within the breast. Blood and 24 hour urine samples were analysed for lactose, and blood was also analysed for C-reactive protein (CRP). Bacteriological examination of milk samples was undertaken where clinical mastitis was present. Results from these analyses were compared to the severity of breast and systemic symptoms experienced. Twenty-two episodes of mastitis and 13 episodes of blocked duct(s) were identified during the study period. When adjusted for co-existing breast pathology milk composition in the breast affected by blocked duct(s) was generally not different from that of healthy breasts. One mother, who was IgA deficient, experienced six of the 13 episodes of blocked duct(s). It is possible that the absence of sIgA in the milk of this mother increased her susceptibility to inflammation of the breast. During mastitis there was a significant increase in sodium, chloride, and serum albumin to a median concentration of 23 mmol&#8260;l; (p&lt;0.001); 30 mmol&#8260;l; (p&lt;0.001) and 0.8g&#8260;l; (p&lt;0.001) respectively, and a decrease in the median concentration of lactose in milk to 152mmol&#8260;l; (p&lt;0.016) from the mastitis breast when compared to the contralateral asymptomatic breast. Increased permeability of the paracellular pathway was confirmed by a significant increase in the median daily excretion of lactose in urine to 7.5 mmol&#8260;24hour (p&lt;0.001). The rate of excretion of lactose in urine over a 24 hour period proved to be, not only a reliable means of assessing breast permeability, but also allowed the researcher to discern whether milk sampled from the breast affected was representative of milk at the site of the inflammation. The changes in lactose in urine were generally consistent with the changes in sodium, chloride and lactose in milk confirming milk expressed for sample analysis was representative of milk from the site of the inflammation</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Fibrocystic disease</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lactation disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of innovation for Australian-invented medical patents and the case of the VenousAid Stocking</field><field name="creator">Mattes, Eugen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]   Technological innovation is considered the main contributor to economic growth. The systems of innovation framework aims to examine the causal pathways leading to technological innovation. However, most existing research under this framework, due to theoretical or methodological weaknesses, is unable to validate causal pathways or determinants of innovation. Institutions that guide human interaction within innovation systems are thought to be particularly important. The challenge has been to develop a taxonomy with which to conduct an empirical analysis of the impact of the institutional milieu on innovation. This thesis examines medical technological innovation within Australia and provides a basis from which such a taxonomy and other associated measures for systems of innovation have been developed. Medical industries are economically significant in developed countries and are amongst the most profitable worldwide. They use patents extensively to protect their innovations. In this context medical patents are an efficient means of examining the determinants of innovation. Few studies worldwide have explored the commercialisation process from patent to technological innovation and none has examined medical patents specifically. This thesis contains three empirical studies: - a description of Australian medical technology patented in the US between 1984-1999; - a survey of their inventors to examine the commercialisation process and identify the determinants of technological innovation; and - a case study of the commercialisation of an invention arising within an Australian university using qualitative methods. The first study is a population-based descriptive study of all US medical patents granted to Australian resident inventors between 1984 and 1999. During this period 7,835 US patents were granted to Australian resident inventors. Of these, 17% are identified as medical, and the proportion of medical patents rose from 10% to 25% of all Australian patents in the US from 1984 to 1999. The increase is largely due to Australian biotechnology patents, which increased from 10% to 55% of all medical patents during this period. Overall, medical patents are an increasingly significant proportion of Australia&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio. The second study is a survey of 402 first-named Australian inventors listed on the 602 medical patents granted in the US in 1984-1994.

One of the major ways that the cell achieves this signal transduction is through the process of phosphorylation. Protein kinases are the enzymes responsible for catalysing this transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to amino acid residues of their specific substrates. A subfamily of serine/threonine kinases known as the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) is essential in a diverse range of cell processes including growth, metabolism, differentiation and death. The first identified MAPKs, the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERKs), were found to be activated in response to mitogenic stimuli such as growth factors. However, since the discovery of the ERKs, other pathways leading to the activation of related kinases have been recognised. These kinases are preferentially activated in response to stress, and are thus termed &#8220;Stress-Activated Protein Kinases&#8221; or SAPKs. They consist of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase isoforms 1, 2 and 3 (also called SAPK1&#947;, SAPK1&#945; and SAPK&#946; respectively) and the p38 MAPKs, p38&#945;, p38&#946;, p38&#947; and p38&#948; (also called SAPK2a, SAPK2b, SAPK3 and SAPK4 respectively). A major challenge in this field has been to identify the substrates and functions of the SAPKs. This has been partly achieved by the development of inhibitors for the JNK MAPKs and SAPK2a/b. However, no inhibitors currently exist that specifically inhibit SAPK3 and SAPK4. Therefore, elucidating the function of these SAPKs has proved more difficult. Recent studies suggest that SAPK3 may play a unique role in the cell compared to other members of the p38 MAPK family. For example, several signalling proteins appear to specifically activate SAPK3 in certain circumstances while not activating other members of the p38 MAPK family. In addition, SAPK3 contains a unique sequence motif that allows it to bind to specialised domains known as PDZ domains. The interaction of SAPK3 with proteins containing these domains may regulate its subcellular localisation and interactions with other proteins in the cell. This project was undertaken to expand the knowledge on the expression, localisation, substrate specificity and binding partners of SAPK3. In Chapter 3 of this thesis, a SAPK3 monoclonal antibody was evaluated for its ability to specifically recognise endogenous SAPK3 protein. SAPK3 was found to be expressed in immortalised cell lines and primary cultures of neonatal rat myocytes, and to be colocalised with the mitochondria of these cells. This co-localisation remained unaltered in response to treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B, and with exposure to osmotic shock, suggesting that SAPK3 substrates may be localised at the mitochondria</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">Phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">Intracellular signalling</field><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling nonlinear time series using selection methods and information criteria</field><field name="creator">Nakamura, Tomomichi</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Time series of natural phenomena usually show irregular fluctuations. Often we want to know the underlying system and to predict future phenomena. An effective way of tackling this task is by time series modelling. Originally, linear time series models were used. As it became apparent that nonlinear systems abound in nature, modelling techniques that take into account nonlinearity in time series were developed. A particularly convenient and general class of nonlinear models is the pseudolinear models, which are linear combinations of nonlinear functions. These models can be obtained by starting with a large dictionary of basis functions which one hopes will be able to describe any likely nonlinearity, selecting a small subset of it, and taking a linear combination of these to form the model. The major component of this thesis concerns how to build good models for nonlinear time series. In building such models, there are three important problems, broadly speaking. The first is how to select basis functions which reflect the peculiarities of the time series as much as possible. The second is how to fix the model size so that the models can reflect the underlying system of the data and the influences of noise included in the data are removed as much as possible. The third is how to provide good estimates for the parameters in the basis functions, considering that they may have significant bias when the noise included in the time series is significant relative to the nonlinearity. Although these problems are mentioned separately, they are strongly interconnected</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time-series analysis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear time series</field><field name="subject">Parameter estimation</field><field name="subject">Selection methods</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between sea urchins and macroalgae in south-western Australia : testing general predictions in a local context</field><field name="creator">Vanderklift, Mathew Arie</field><field name="description">Generalist herbivores profoundly influence the biomass and species composition of macroalgae assemblages. In subtidal ecosystems of temperate latitudes, large invertebrates are usually the most influential herbivores. I tested the prediction that exclusion of invertebrate herbivores would lead to changes in the biomass and species composition of the macroalgae assemblages that are a prominent feature of the reefs in south-western Australia. The most abundant invertebrate herbivores were sea urchins (Heliocidaris erythrogramma, Phyllacanthus irregularis and Centrostephanus tenuispinus), and these occupied different trophic positions. Heliocidaris was present at virtually all reefs surveyed, and was particularly abundant in the Fremantle region. Analyses of stable isotopes and direct observations of gut contents revealed that it was almost exclusively herbivorous, and that it mainly ate foliose brown algae. In contrast, Phyllacanthus and Centrostephanus were omnivorous; while they consumed large proportions of algae, a substantial proportion of the diet of both species was animal tissue. Because Heliocidaris is a generalist herbivore that occurs at high densities, it could exert a large influence on the macroalgae assemblage. This prediction was tested by a series of press experiments. Contrary to the prediction, Heliocidaris exerted a very minor influence on the biomass, and no detectable influence on the species composition, of attached macroalgae. However, it exerted a major influence on the retention of drift macroalgae and seagrass by trapping and feeding on drift. It exerted a particularly strong influence on retention of the kelp Ecklonia radiata. This kelp was not abundant in the attached algae assemblage (when all plots were pooled it ranked 35th in biomass), but was abundant as drift (ranking 1st). Most of the drift Ecklonia was retained by sea urchins, rather than freely drifting.Herbivorous fish may also influence macroalgae assemblages. To compare the effects of sea urchins versus fish on recruiting and adult macroalgae a 13-month exclusion experiment was conducted. There were no detectable effects of sea urchins (mainly Heliocidaris) on either recruiting or adult macroalgae. There were some patterns in the biomass of recruiting algae consistent with an influence by herbivorous fish; however,  these patterns were also consistent with the presence of artefacts (shading and reduced water flow) by fish exclusion devices. I began with the prediction that large invertebrate herbivores were a major influence on the macroalgae assemblages of subtidal reefs in south-western Australia. Overall, there was little evidence to support this prediction: within spatial extents of tens of square metres and over periods of 1-2 years, only minor effects were detected. However, it remains plausible that herbivores exert an influence over long time periods across large spatial extents in south-western Australia. I propose that trophic subsidies support the comparatively high densities of Heliocidaris that exist at some reefs. I further propose that these subsidies mediate the effects of sea urchins on the attached macroalgae assemblage, and that they might play an important role in energy and nutrient cycling in these nearshore ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sea urchins -- Ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Reef ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Marine algae -- Ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the relationships between managers' job-related affective well-being, intrinsic job satisfaction and performance</field><field name="creator">Hosie, Peter</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for the complete text.]  This study examines the 'happy-productive worker' thesis, by investigating the impact of job-related affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction on managers' performance. The fundamental goal of the research was to establish which indicators of managers' affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction predict dimensions of their contextual and task performance. A critique was undertaken of the substantial literature on affective well-being, intrinsic job satisfaction and managers' performance. Key theoretical developments were integrated to provide linkages between the conceptual bases of these constructs. Warr's Vitamin Model was identified as the most comprehensive synthesis of research and theories into affective well-being. Evidence has emerged to suggest that managers' job performance comprises both contextual and task performance domains. Decades of research have been unable to establish a strong link between job satisfaction and performance. Affect has rarely been used as a predictor of managers' job performance outcomes. Despite mixed empirical evidence, there is support in the literature to suggest that a relationship exists between affective well-being, intrinsic job satisfaction and managers' performance. A series of ancillary research questions, underscoring the main goal of the study, were developed from the gaps identified in the literature to establish if there was an association between managers' affective well-being, intrinsic job satisfaction and their contextual and task performance. To what extent does affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction determine different dimensions of managers' contextual and task performance? Does the construct of managers' performance consist of the two dimensions, contextual and task performance? Does positive affective well-being result in enhanced managers' performance, and is poor affective well-being detrimental to managers' performance? These research questions were formed into hypotheses for testing.   Questionnaire items were derived from the literature to establish the affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction scales. Managers' contextual and task performance scales were developed through an analysis of the literature. Questionnaire items were further refined using feedback from expert reviewers and a pilot survey. A cross-sectional survey was administered to managers (n=1,552) from a range of occupational groupings in 19 Western Australian private, public, and third sector organisations. A total of 400 useable questionnaires was returned, representing a response rate of 26%. Self-report data were used to measure affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction, while superiors' ratings provided an evaluation of managers' contextual and task performance. An empirical methodology was used to test the hypotheses to enable the research questions to be answered and to suggest a Partial Model of Managers' Affective Well-being, Intrinsic Job Satisfaction and Performance. Answering the research questions required the development of an instrument to measure the structure of managers' contextual and task performance. An 8- dimensional measurement model of managers' performance, derived from the survey data, was tested by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to differentiate the structure of managers' contextual and task performance. The performance construct was operationalised in terms of four contextual dimensions (Endorsing, Helping, Persisting, Following) and four task dimensions (Monitoring, Technical, Influencing, Delegating). These dimensions were confirmed through multi-sample analysis and cross-validation techniques of managers' and superiors' ratings (n = 200 and n = 125). Canonical correlation and standard multiple regression were used to analyse the linear combination of managers' affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction with contextual and task performance. Indicators of affective wellbeing and intrinsic job satisfaction were found to predict dimensions of managers' performance, irrespective of whether the performance scores were from self-report or superiors' ratings.  A large amount of the variance of managers' performance was explained by affective well-being and intrinsic job satisfaction. Affective well-being selfreport (Positive Affect, Intrinsic Job Satisfaction) was found to be positively associated with a dimension of superiors' reports on task performance (Influencing). Positive associations for dimensions of affective well-being selfreport (Positive Affect, Anxiety and Relaxation) were also found to be negatively associated with dimensions of superiors' reports on managers' task performance (Monitoring) and contextual performance (Following) that was also negatively associated with the task performance dimension (Technical). As predicted, positive affective well-being was related to enhanced managerial performance, whereas diminished affective well-being indicated poorer performance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Executives -- Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Performance -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Performance standards</field><field name="subject">Managers</field><field name="subject">Intrinsic job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Happy-productive worker thesis</field><field name="subject">Job performance</field><field name="subject">Job-related affective well-being</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic identification of water-oxygen and water-hydroxyl complexes and their importance to icy outer solar system bodies</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis studies hydrated oxygen and hydroxyl radicals as a basis for understanding the species formed in the icy surfaces of outer solar system bodies. Infrared spectroscopy is used to identify the species water-oxygen (H2O&#183;O2) and water-hydroxyl (H2O&#183;HO) complexes in inert gas matrices and presents a new mechanism for O2 formation in irradiated ices. The H2O&#183;O2 Complex -- The H2O&#183;O2 complex was identified in solid argon matrices at 11 K by measuring the infrared spectra of H2O&#8260;O2&#8260;Ar matrices. Absorption bands at 3731.6, 3638.3, 1590.2&#8260;1593.6 and 1551.9&#8260;1548.8 cm-1 were respectively assigned to asymmetric OH water stretching, symmetric OH water stretching, H2O bending, and the O2 stretching vibrations. This experimental data was in good agreement with the results of quantum mechanical calculations that predict the vibrational frequencies and intensities for H2O&#183;O2. These calculations gave a binding energy of 0.72 kcal mol-1 for the complex. The H2O&#183;HO Complex --  The H2O&#183;HO complex was identified in solid argon matrices at 11 K by measuring the infrared spectra of OH&#8260;H2O&#8260;Ar matrices. The OH was formed in a Tesla coil discharge of an H2O&#8260;Ar gas stream. This gas stream also provided the source of H2O and Ar needed for the experiments. Three absorption bands were assigned to the OH stretch of the hydroxyl group in the complex. These three bands were caused by the occupancy of three different lattice sites. This experimental data was in good agreement with quantum mechanical calculations that predict the vibrational frequencies and intensities for H2O&#183;HO. These calculations gave a binding energy of 5.69 kcal mol-1 for the complex. O2 Formation in Irradiated Ice --  A new mechanism for O2 formation in irradiated ice is presented. This mechanism draws on experimental evidence in the literature to explain the observations of solid O2 on or near the surface of the icy Galilean satellites, Europa and Ganymede. It is proposed that on these bodies, hydrogen peroxide, formed from the radiolysis and photolysis of the ice, is present in highly localized aggregates that hinder O2 diffusion out of the icy surface into the tenuous atmosphere. Further radiolysis and photolysis of these hydrogen peroxide aggregates can then lead to O2 formation via the formation of a short lived water-oxygen atom complex, H2O&#183;O.

While in healthy hosts most infections with CMV are asymptomatic, the virus can cause severe disease in immunocompromised hosts. Thus, the increase in organ transplantation and the HIV/AIDS pandemic have established human CMV (HCMV) as a clinically important pathogen. Indeed, HCMV infections are now the major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients, which has led to more research targeting CMV for effective anti-viral treatment. The discovery that cytomegaloviruses encode several genes which are involved in immune escape has prompted a new area of research, aimed at understanding immune escape mechanisms for exploitation as potential anti-viral therapeutics. By targeting the viral proteins directly, or their receptors in the host, it may be possible to treat CMV disease by agonistic/antagonistic therapy. The first part of this thesis describes the first demonstration of anti-NK1.1 staining in situ to identify NK cells using a modified in vivo perfusion/fixation method. Using this method, we have compared the acute NK1.1+ cellular response to wild-type MCMV infection in the visceral organs of genetically susceptible intra-NK complex recombinant BALB.B6-CT6 (Cmv1s, NK1.1+) mice with resistant C57B&#8260;J (Cmv1r, NK1.1+) and BALB.B6-Cmv1r mice (Cmv1r, NK1.1+). Expression of viral antigens and the consequences of infection on other cellular subsets, were also analyzed in this study. The data show that in susceptible mice (Cmv1s) MCMV infection is predominent in the marginal zone of splenic white pulp, resulting in local changes in various cellular constituents, including macrophages, NK cells and DC. In the liver, distinct foci of infection were comprised of large numbers of macrophages and NK1.1+ cells surrounding infected cytomegalic cells.

Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  This thesis reviews, extends and applies to urban traffic analysis the entropy concept of Shannon and Luce's mathematical psychology in a fairly complex and mathematically demanding model of human decision making, if it is solved as a deeply nested structure of logit calculus. Recognising consumers' different preferences and the universal propensity to seek the best choice when going to some desired goal (k), a transparent mathematical program (MP) is developed: the equivalent of a nested multinomial logit model without its inherent computational difficulty. The MP model makes a statistical assessment of individual decisions based on a randomised (measurable) utility within a given choice structure: some path through a diagram (Rk, Dk), designed a priori, of a finite number of sequential choices. The Equivalence Theorem (ET) formalises the process and states a non-linear MP with linear constraints that maximises collective satisfaction: utility plus weighted entropy, where the weight (1/&#952;n) is a behavioural parameter to be calibrated in each case, eg for the Perth CBD. An optimisation subject to feasible routes through the (Rk, Dk) network thus captures the rational behaviour of consumers on their individually different best-choice decision paths towards their respective goals (k). This theory has been applied to urban traffic assignment before: a Stochastic User Equi-librium (SUE). What sets this thesis apart is its focus on MP models that can be solved with standard Operations Research software (eg MINOS), models for which the ET is a conditio sine qua non. A brief list of SUE examples in the literature includes Fisk's logit SUE model in (impractically many) route flows. Dial's STOCH algorithm obviates path enumeration, yet is a logit multi-path assignment procedure, not an MP model; it is nei-ther destination oriented nor an optimisation towards a SUE. A revision of Dial's method is provided, named STOCH[k], that computes primal variables (node and link flows) and Lagrangian duals (the satisfaction difference n&#8594;k). Sheffi &amp; Powell presented an unconstrained optimisation problem, but favoured a probit SUE, defying closed formulae and standard OR software. Their model corresponds to the (constrained) dual model here, yet the specifics of our primary MP model and its dual are possible only if one restricts himself to logit SUE models, including the ET, which is logit-specific.  A real world application needs decomposition, and the Perth CBD example is iteratively solved by Partial Linearisation, switching from (measured) disutility minimisation to Sheffi &amp; Powell's Method of Successive Averages near the optimum. The methodology is demonstrated on the Perth Central Business District (CBD). To that end, parameter &#920; is calibrated on Main Roads' traffic count data over the years 1997/98 and 1998/99. The method is a revision of Liu &amp; Fricker's simultaneous estimation of not only &#920; but an appropriate trip matrix also. Our method handles the more difficult variable costs (congestion), incomplete data (missing observations) and observation errors (wrong data). Finally, again based on Main Roads' data (a sub-area trip matrix), a Perth CBD traffic assignment is computed, (a) as a logit SUE and - for comparison - (b) as a DUE (using the PARTAN method of Florian, Gu&#233;lat and Spiess). The results are only superficially similar. In conclusion, the methodology has the potential to replace current DUE models and to deepen transport policy analysis, taking into account individual behaviour and a money-metric utility that quantifies 'social benefits', for instance in a cost-benefit-analysis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stochastic analysis</field><field name="subject">Entropy (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Traffic assignment -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Traffic assignment -- Western Australia -- Perth -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">City traffic -- Western Australia -- Perth -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">City traffic -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchange processes between littoral and pelagic waters in a stratified lake</field><field name="creator">Marti, Clelia Luisa</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The lake boundaries are an important source of sediment, nutrients and chemicals. For life inside the lake, the exchange between the lake boundaries (littoral) and lake interior (pelagic) is of central importance to Limnology as the net flux of nutrients into the water column is both the driving force and limiting factor for most algae blooms found during the stratification period. Consequently, the understanding of the relevant processes defining such an exchange is a further step toward a sound basis for future decisions by lake managers in order to ensure high water quality. The objective of this research was to investigate the physical processes responsible for the exchange of water and particles between the lake boundaries and the lake interior. An integrated approach using field experiments and 3D modelling as applied to Lake Kinneret (Israel) is presented. The field data revealed large-scale metalimnion oscillations with amplitudes up to 10 m in response to westerly diurnal winds, the existence of a well-defined suspended particle intrusion into the metalimnion of the lake, characterized by high concentrations of organic matter, and a well-mixed benthic boundary layer (BBL). The changes in the thermal structure explained the observed vertical and horizontal movements of the suspended particle intrusion. The horizontal advective transport via the metalimnion, associated with the velocities induced by the basin-scale mode-two Poincare wave, controlled the exchange between the lake boundaries and lake interior on daily time scales. The observed BBL over the lake slope varied markedly with time and space. Detailed comparison of simulation results with field data revealed that the model captured the lake hydrodynamics for time scales from hours to days. The model could then be used to extract the residual motions in the various regions of the lake. The residual motions below the surface layer were predominantly forced by the basin-scale internal wave motions, but the residual motion in the surface layer was found to be very sensitive to the curl of the wind field. The residual circulation was responsible for redistributing mass throughout the lake basin on time scales from days to weeks. A clear connection of dynamics of the BBL with the large-scale features of the flow was addressed. The time history of the mixing in the BBL and the resulting cross-shore flux was shown to vary with the phase of the basin-scale internal waves.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tiberias, Lake (Israel)</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Circulation -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Littoral drift -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Stratified flow -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Exchange processes</field><field name="subject">Lake Kinneret</field><field name="subject">Benthic boundary layer</field><field name="subject">Flux path</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Welfare implications of nonidentical time valuations under constrained road pricing policies : analytical studies with corridor and urban-wide networks</field><field name="creator">Sapkota, Virginia A.</field><field name="description">The goal of the research is to devise an equitable road pricing system which would leave the majority of routes free of tolls, so that low income people would suffer no cash loss although they would probably suffer loss of time. The aims of the dissertation are twofold. The first is to provide a numerical analysis of how urban commuters with differing abilities to pay would respond to additional road user charges. The welfare implications of such differential responses are examined and their policy implications analysed. The second aim is to develop a practical framework to model congestion pricing policies in the context of heterogeneous users. To achieve these aims, the following objectives have been set: (a) Using a simple network with two parallel competing routes, determine both welfare maximising and revenue maximising tolls under the constraint that only one route can be priced. In this setting, determine the allocation of traffic between the alternative routes, the efficiency gain, the revenue, the changes in travel cost and the distributional effects. (b) Establish a realistic model of an actual urban area to examine the impacts of selectively tolling congestible routes. As in the simple network case, assess the effects of toll policy on traffic distribution, network efficiency, revenues, and the welfare of the individual consumer and society. (c) Evaluate whether the non-identical treatment of users will enhance the acceptability of congestion pricing as a transport policy. Results from the simulations indicate that non-identical treatment of drivers? responses to toll charges provides better understanding of the differential impacts of various pricing policies. Allowing for heterogeneity in time valuation provides a better assessment of the efficiency of pricing policies and of the welfare impacts of toll charges, as it is able to capture their differential effects. More importantly, it shows that low-income commuters may not be significantly worse off with pricing especially when there is a free alternative route. This research demonstrates the need to adopt appropriate analytical techniques and assumptions when modelling the traffic equilibrium in a network with tolls. These include relaxing the homogeneity assumption, examining sensitivity to supply function parameter values and to the effect of vehicle operating cost, and using a route rather than link based measure of consumer surplus</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toll roads</field><field name="subject">Toll roads -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Congestion pricing</field><field name="subject">Second-best</field><field name="subject">Non-identical time valuations</field><field name="subject">Welfare impact of tolls</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A high-resolution superconducting pressure gauge and irreversible magnetic effects in Nb and NbTi wires</field><field name="creator">Saxey, David W.</field><field name="description">A high resolution pressure gauge has been developed for use in thermodynamic measurements along the lambda line in liquid helium. The gauge was designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures and provide pressure measurements up to 30bar, with an accuracy of 3 &#215; 10&#175;&#185;&#186;bar in a 1Hz bandwidth. Experiments reported here show the gauge to have met these specifications; at least for measurements close to zero pressure, at temperatures close to 4.5K. It is expected that operation at higher pressures, and at temperatures closer to the lambda transition, will result in similar or even improved performance. The gauge consists of a titanium-alloy diaphragm with a superconducting position transducer read-out. Compensation techniques internal to the superconducting circuit were used to eliminate any significant sensitivity to temperature fluctuations and in-line acceleration. For high values of common-mode rejection, thermal compensation revealed a non-linear temperature characteristic which was exploited to provide a further reduction in the temperature sensitivity. Acceleration compensation was achieved up to a common-mode rejection of more than 78dB. Present performance appears to be limited by thermal gradient fluctuations at low frequencies and at higher frequencies by a noise source which appears to originate beyond the superconducting transducer. It is expected that some further improvement may be gained in this higher frequency band simply by trapping a larger persistent current in the superconducting circuit. In the course of development and characterization of the gauge several anomalous effects were discovered and investigated. In response to changes in temperature, the gauge was found to exhibit irreversible behaviour in a variety of ways. These phenomena were fully investigated and found to be complex in nature. A critical state model was employed which was successful in explaining many of the observed effects. Other authors have observed apparently related behaviour in samples of niobium and some have developed similar critical state models which give results generally consistent with those reported here.

One population consisted of a mixture of 40 strains sown in equal proportions, while the other was a bulk-hybrid population consisting of F2 seed from 253 crosses. Seed harvested annually and kept in cold storage was grown in an irrigated common garden at the University of Western Australia Field Station at Shenton Park, along with samples of the ancestral mixtures, to examine changes within these populations. Evolution in the strain mixture populations was measured by changes in strain frequency; strains were considered ecologically successful if their relative contribution was maintained or increased from that at sowing. Mixtures containing an additional 12 cultivars were also sown at each site to examine short-term population changes. The relative importance of 38 attributes measured in single-strain swards and spaced plants at Nabawa and Mt Barker was then related to strain success in mixtures at each site. Evolution in the bulk hybrid populations was measured in spaced plants at Shenton Park by changes in mean values and variability of 26 attributes. The ancestral populations evolved into markedly different populations at each site. Most evolution occurred within three years of sowing, due to elimination of poorly adapted genotypes. Within sites, the direction of selection was similar for both mixtures. In the strain mixture populations, different strains became dominant at each site. Divergent strains, those not identical to the sown strains, were significant components of the populations, particularly at Mt Barker, but their frequency did not increase. In the bulk hybrid populations, changes occurred in the means of 20 characters and variability declined in 11 characters at one or both sites. Appropriate flowering time was fundamental for success in both environments. At Nabawa, early flowering was crucial, while successful genotypes at Mt Barker were midseason and late flowering. Flowering time in both environments was a compromise between sufficient earliness for adequate seed production prior to the onset of summer drought, and deferment for as long as possible to allow plants to develop maximum size to compete for light in spring. The balance between these two competing forces differed in response to length of the growing season at each site</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subterranean clover -- Genetics -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Subterranean clover -- Phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasound imaging of anatomy and milk ejection in the human lactating breast</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Donna T.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  In women, as in other mammals, the ability to successfully lactate depends on both complete functional development of the mammary gland and the stimulation of the milk ejection reflex to enable the suckling young to remove stored milk. Prior to my studies, Sir Astley Cooper&#8217;s carried out the most comprehensive investigation of the gross anatomy of the lactating human breast in 1840. I have used ultrasound to image the anatomy of the breasts of fully breastfeeding women (1-6 months, n=22) with particular emphasis on the distribution of the main milk ducts, glandular and adipose tissue. Scanning of the milk duct system demonstrated that the anatomy in the region of the areola and nipple is different to that depicted in standard anatomical textbooks. The main milk ducts were small (diameter, left: 1.9 &#177; 0.6 mm; right: 2.1 &#177; 0.7 mm), superficial (depth, left: 4.50 &#177; 1.98 mm; right: 4.74 &#177; 1.59 mm) and branched close to the nipple (within 8.20 &#177; 6.27 mm, left; 7.00 &#177; 3.98 mm, right) (mean &#177; SD). The lactiferous sinuses (described in current textbooks) were not observed and the number of main ducts detected at the base of the nipple was less than the quoted 15-20 (9.4, range 4-18). Quantitative descriptions of the morphology of either the lactating or, indeed, the non-lactating breasts have not been attempted using ultrasound. I developed a systematic approach to ultrasound imaging of the breast that provided a semi-quantitative description of the distribution of glandular and adipose tissues within the lactating breast. Approximately two thirds of the breast was comprised of glandular tissue. Intraglandular fat was identified as hypoechoic transects within the hyperechoic glandular tissue. Over 65% of the glandular tissue together with 50% of the intraglandular fat and 25% of the subcutaneous fat was located within a 30 mm radius of the base of the nipple. The absence of lactiferous sinuses and the arrangement of tissue within a 30 mm radius of the nipple suggested that the current conceptualisation of sucking dynamics of the infant requires revision. Successful milk removal depends on the stimulation of the milk ejection reflex and currently subjective assessments of milk ejection such as the mother&#8217;s sensations and an alteration in the infants sucking and swallowing are used clinically to confirm milk ejection whereas in research two stressful invasive procedures; changes blood oxytocin and intra-ductal pressure have been used.

This original system has been designed to aid radiologists to detect breast cancer on mammograms. The system embodies attribute-driven segmentation in which the attributes of an image are extracted progressively in a step-by-step, hierarchical fashion. Global, low-level attributes obtained in the early stages are used to derive local, high-level attributes in later stages, leading to increasing refinement and accuracy in image segmentation and analysis. The proposed system can be characterized as: &#8226; a bootstrap engine driven by the attributes of the images; &#8226; a solid framework supporting the process of hierarchical segmentation; &#8226; a universal platform for the development and integration of segmentation and analysis techniques; and &#8226; an extensible database in which knowledge about the image is accumulated. Central to this system are three major components: 1. a series of applications for attribute acquisition; 2. a standard format for attribute normalization; and 3. a database for attribute storage and data exchange between applications. The first step of the automatic process is to segment the mammogram hierarchically into several distinctive regions that represent the anatomy of the breast. The adequacy and quality of the mammogram are then assessed using the anatomical features obtained from segmentation. Further image analysis, such as breast density classification and lesion detection, may then be carried out inside the breast region. Several domain-specific algorithms have therefore been developed for the attribute acquisition component in the system. These include: 1. automatic pectoral muscle segmentation; 2. adequacy assessment of positioning and exposure; and 3. contrast enhancement of mass lesions. An adaptive algorithm is described for automatic segmentation of the pectoral muscle on mammograms of mediolateral oblique (MLO) views</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Radiography -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Radiography -- Positioning</field><field name="subject">Radiography -- Image quality</field><field name="subject">Image analysis -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Mammograms</field><field name="subject">Image segmentation</field><field name="subject">Attribute-driven</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical processes controlling circulation and frontal zones in Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Nahas, Elizabeth Leila</field><field name="description">Shark Bay is a large inverse estuary, located in Western Australia. It has a number of unique habitats that support important species. The dynamics of circulation in Shark Bay have an influence on the species that inhabit the region, on small, local scales as well as on large Bay-wide scales. Numerical modeling and field data were used to examine small-scale dynamics in relation to an important recreational fish, pink snapper (Pagrus auratus). Icthyoplankton surveys collected and recorded egg density in regions where snapper are found. A barotropic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a two-dimensional Lagrangian particle-tracking program to simulate the passive transport of eggs through regions where spawning is known to occur. Circulation modeling results indicated residual flows on small scales that served to retain the eggs in the region where they were originally spawned. Results corroborate genetic work on adult snapper, which found no evidence intermixing of populations in Shark Bay. The numerical model was then further refined to run in a baroclinic mode. Simulations of salinity and temperature gradients were used to recreate frontal systems in Shark Bay. Frontal regions divide the Bay into a northern and a southern section as well as separate it from the ocean. Application of an analytical method for calculating front locations was consistent with the observed results and indicated that the primary forces determining frontal locations in the Bay are tides and gravitational circulation.

It was introduced accidentally during the latter part of the 19th century, apparently independently through the major ports of southern Australia. The widespread success of wild radish, and therefore the likelihood of distinct populations, gives us the opportunity to study the colonizing process with adaptation in annual outbreeding species, and to explore their genetic diversity. The aims of this thesis were to study the genetic diversity of wild radish and to investigate which factors are important in its success. After an initial review of the literature (chapter 2), the thesis describes experiments where genetic variation between and within populations was compared at 55 sites in transects across the wheat belt and high rainfall zones of temperate Western Australia (chapter 3). In chapter 4, variation in life history traits was compared with variation in AFLP molecular markers. The role of seed dormancy in the survival of the species was examined in chapter 5, and variation in the oil content of seeds and their fatty acid composition was examined in chapter 6. Finally, the results were discussed in chapter 7 with special reference to the adaptive value of outcrossing in annual weeds. The results suggest that wild radish has evolved to fit the Australian environment. However, measurement of 14 morphological and phenological characters showed that in most cases within site variation was much greater than that between sites. Most of the variation between sites was associated with geoclusters, a name given to zones of similar environmental conditions in regard to rainfall and temperature. Thus plants from areas with high rainfall and low temperature produced longer, wider pods with more segments, heavier seeds and flowered later than plants from more arid areas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radishes -- Genetics -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Radishes -- Adaptation -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Radishes -- Genetics -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Radishes -- Adaptation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant population genetics -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Plant population genetics -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The timing and source of gold-bearing fluids in the Laverton Greenstone Belt, Yilgarn Craton, with emphasis on the Wallaby gold deposit</field><field name="creator">Salier, Brock Peter</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The Laverton Greenstone Belt (LGB), located in the northeastern part of the Eastern Goldfields Province (EGP) of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, has a total contained gold endowment of over 690t. An important feature of the gold deposits in the LGB is their close spatial association with granitoids, with many gold deposits located adjacent to, or hosted by, granitoids. Recently-proposed genetic models for Archaean orogenic gold deposits have emphasised the role of granitoids in the formation of ore-deposits, but differ significantly in the nature of that role. Some models suggest that the granitoids are a source of ore-fluids and solutes, whereas others suggest that granitoids exert an important structural control on gold mineralisation. Such competing genetic models for gold mineralisation variably propose either a proximal-magmatic or distal-metamorphic, or less commonly distal-magmatic, source for goldbearing fluids, or mixing of fluids from multiple sources. Isotope geochemistry and geochronological studies are used to constrain the source and timing of auriferous fluids at nine gold deposits in the LGB in an attempt to differentiate between conflicting genetic models. To overcome the lack of detailed deposit-scale geological constraints inherent to any regional study, hypotheses generated from regional datasets are tested in a detailed case-study of the Wallaby gold deposit. The Pb-isotope compositions of ore-related sulphides from deposits in the LGB plot along the line representing crustal-Pb in the Norseman-Wiluna Belt of the EGP, with individual deposits clustering with other nearby deposits based on their geographic location. This trend is similar to that recorded in the Kalgoorlie-Norseman region in the southern EGP, and is consistent with a basement Pb reservoir for gold-bearing fluids. As such, data are consistent with a similar fluid source for all gold deposits. The Nd and Sr isotopic composition of goldrelated scheelite in the LGB clusters very tightly. The inferred ore-fluid composition has a slightly positive &#949;Nd, similar to ore fluids at other gold deposits in the EGP for which a proximal magmatic source is highly improbable. As such, Sr and Nd data are consistent with a similar fluid source for the gold deposits analysed in the LGB, but cannot unequivocally define that source. The median S, C and O isotopic compositions of ore minerals from all nine different gold deposits studied in the LGB fall in a very narrow range</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Western Australia -- Laverton</field><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Western Australia -- Yilgarn Craton</field><field name="subject">Greenstone belts -- Western Australia -- Laverton</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Archaean</field><field name="subject">Geochronology</field><field name="subject">Isotope</field><field name="subject">Wallaby</field><field name="subject">Yilgarn</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking about the responsible parent : freedom and educating the child in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">McGowan, Wayne S.</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with how educational legislation shapes and uses freedom for the purpose of governing the parent. The key question guiding the study was: How does the Act constitute the &#8216;parent&#8217; as a subject position responsible for schooling the child? Central to the work is an examination of the School Education Act 1999 (the Act) using Foucault&#8217;s thinking on governmentality. This is prefaced by historical accounts that bring together freedom and childhood as contrived styles of conduct that provide the governmental logic behind the Act. The study reveals how the Act shapes and uses the truth of freedom/childhood to construct the responsible parent as a style of conduct pegged to a neo-liberal political rationality of government. It is this political rationality that provides the node or point of encounter between the technologies of power and the self within the Act which forms the &#8216;responsible&#8217; identity of the parent as an active self-governing entrepreneur made more visible by the political construction of &#8216;others.&#8217; This is a legal-political subjectivity centred on the truth of freedom/childhood and a neo-liberal rationality of government that believes that any change to our current ethical way of being in relation to educating the child would ruin the very freedoms upon which our civilised lifestyle depends. In essence, the Act relies on the production of &#8216;others&#8217; as the poor, Aboriginal and radical who must be regulated and made autonomous to constitute the &#8216;parent&#8217; as an active consumer whose autonomous educational choices are an expression of responsibility in relation to schooling the child</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault, Michel</field><field name="subject">Western Australia.</field><field name="subject">Liberty -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Parent and child (Law) -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Parent and child (Law) -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Responsibility -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Parent-teacher relationship -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Parenthood -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Social control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Children's rights -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Children's rights -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Children -- Legal status, laws etc. -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Children -- Legal status, laws etc. -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Education -- Law and legislation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Education -- Law and legislation -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Freedom and politics of education</field><field name="subject">Criticism and educational law</field><field name="subject">Parents and schooling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Figuring space : considering the figure in the construction of space as materialist film</field><field name="creator">Kuronen, Suzanne</field><field name="description">Figuring Space; considering the figure in the construction of space in materialist film is an analysis of film space that uses either the image of a figure or the actual figure of the viewer in its construction. The thesis focuses on particular screen works of William Raban, Guy Sherwin, Malcolm Le Grice, Chris Welsby, Nicky Hamlyn, Peter Gidal (all members of the London Filmmakers&#8217; Cooperative) and the Canadian artist Michael Snow. It discusses the works in relation to the basic materials of time, light and sound found in film and video. The thesis looks at the way the film frame was implemented in the work of these artists to challenge preconceived notions of film space. It also highlights the uncertainty of spatial relativity within the screen image once the techniques imposed by the artist undermine previous determinations of positions in space. The frame provides necessary elements with which a reading of a pictorial space can be made. In addition, with some of the works discussed, the frame defines an exterior screen space that at times questions the boundaries between on-screen and off-screen, and fictive space and real space. While in other works that are addressed, binaries exist within which the boundaries of a picture plane are utilized to determine an object&#8217;s spatial relativity, which in turn questions the relativity of those boundaries that determine it. The frame that previously confirmed the illusions of space within the pictorial plane could no longer be prescribed as definitive. Calculations of the film space would become dependent upon a point of origin that is situated within actual time and space at the position of the viewer.

C.</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.] In In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) modulator generating Continuous-Phase-Frequency-Shift-Keying (CPFSK) signals, shortcomings in the implementation of the analogue reconstruction filters result in the loss of the constant envelope property of the output signal. Ripples in the envelope function cause undesirable spreading of the transmitted signal spectrum into adjacent channels when the signal passes through non-linear elements in the transmission path. This results in the failure of the transmitted signal in meeting transmission standards requirements. Therefore, digital techniques compensating for these shortcomings play an important role in enhancing the performance of the IQ modulator.  In this thesis, several techniques to compensate for the irregularities in the I and Q channels are presented. The main emphasis is on preserving a constant magnitude and linear phase characteristics in the pass-band of the analogue filters as well as compensating for the imbalances between the I and Q channels. A generic digital pre-compensation model is used, and based on this model, the digital compensation schemes are formulated using control and signal processing techniques.    Four digital compensation techniques are proposed and analysed. The first method is based on H2 norm minimization while the second method solves for the pre-compensation filters by posing the problem as one of H&#8734; optimisation. The third method stems from the well-known principle of Wiener filtering. Note that the digital compensation filters found using these methods are computed off-line.  We then proceed by designing adaptive compensation filters that runs on-line and uses the &#8220;live&#8221; modulator input data to make the necessary measurements and compensations. These adaptive filters are computed based on the well-known Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithm. The advantage of using this approach is that the modulator does not require to be taken off-line in the process of calculating the pre-compensation filters and thus will not disrupt the normal operation of the modulator.    The compensation performance of all methods is studied analytically using computer simulations and practical experiments. The results indicate that the proposed methods are effective and are able to provide substantial compensation for the shortcomings of the analogue reconstruction filters in the I and Q channels. In addition, the adaptive compensation scheme, implemented on a DSP platform shows that there is significant reduction in side-lobe levels for the compensated signal spectrum.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Digital filters (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Digital compensation</field><field name="subject">IQ modulator</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's parenting expectations and their influence on adjustment to parenthood</field><field name="creator">Harwood, Kate</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The transition to parenthood places a number of emotional, physical, and cognitive demands on individuals.

The study sought to find which aspects of learning styles and strategies each gender enjoyed as a way to provide information to improve classroom language study and enrolment, particularly among boys. The study involved two, private schools, one boys&#8217; and one girls&#8217; &#8212; from the same socio-economic background. The schools were chosen because they had high enrolments in second languages, allowing meaningful amounts of data to be obtained. The single gender classes also permitted clear analysis of which classroom behaviours and activities suited each gender. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods was used. Data were collected using a student questionnaire, classroom observations and teacher interviews. Gender differences were found in a number of aspects of learning styles and strategies. Girls favoured collaborative learning styles that emphasised experience and support. Boys favoured a learning style emphasising clear parameters and expectations and opportunities to produce comprehensible output in the target language. The study found that teachers matched speaking activities to the preferred learning styles of the gender being taught.

To address the first question, we use a pattern recognition algorithm, called the penalised LSE approach. By defining bear markets as those stock market regimes where the average returns are statistically significantly negative or below the risk free rate, we are able to detect two bear market periods in Australia in the past 20 years. These are the November 1987 to February 1988 and the April 2000 to May 2000 periods. To address the second question, we study the change in investors&#8217; attitudes to varieties of systematic risk and the aggregate number and dollar value of shares traded in portfolios as a result of the regime switch from pre-bear to bear period. Out of the 7 categories of risk considered in this study, the transition from pre-bear to bear regime in both sample periods had a significant impact mainly on investors&#8217; attitude toward the size risk factor. Investors systematically became more sensitive to firm size as stock market conditions entered into the 1987&#8260;1988 bear market.

We also find that the regime switches resulted in lower portfolio trading volumes.

Alterations in blood oxygen levels and blood distribution evoke integrated neural, mechanical and humoral responses which modulate peripheral vasomotor tone to maintain systemic cardiovascular integrity. The balance between the local effects of hypoxia and changes in chemoreflex control of vascular tone during hypoxia determine whether net vasoconstriction or vasodilatation is evident in the peripheral vasculature. The mechanisms contributing to hypoxic vasodilatation per se have not previously been defined in healthy humans. Study 1 of this thesis (Chapter 3) investigated the mechanisms contributing to vasomotor responses to chemoreflex activation in the human forearm ...

The results of this thesis indicate that in healthy humans isocapnic hypoxia induces sympathetic vasoconstriction, which masks underlying &#946;-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilatation. The normal vasomotor response to isocapnic hypoxia is impaired in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

In particular, the most important concept in this theory, the maximal monotone operators. Here we make an attempt to describe most of the important results and concepts on maximal monotone operators and how they all tie together. We will take a brief look at subdifferentials, which generalize the notion of a derivative. The subdifferential is a maximal monotone operator and it has proved to be of fundamental importance for the study of maximal monotone operators. The theory of maximal monotone operators is somewhat complete in reflexive Banach spaces. However, in nonreflexive Banach spaces it is still to be developed fully. As such, here we will describe most of the important results about maximal monotone operators in Banach spaces and we will distinguish between the reflexive Banach spaces and nonreflexive Banach spaces when a property is known to hold only in reflexive Banach spaces. In the latter case, we will state what the corresponding situation is in nonreflexive Banach spaces and we will give counter examples whenever such a result is known to fail in nonreflexive Banach spaces. The representations of monotone operators by convex functions have found to be extremely useful for the study of maximal monotone operators and it has generated a lot of interest of late. We will discuss some of those key representations and their properties. We will also demonstrate how these representations could be utilized to obtain results about maximal monotone operators. We have included a discussion about the very important Rockafellar sum theorem and some its generalizations. This key result and its generalizations have only been proved in reflexive Banach spaces. We will also discuss several special cases where the Rockafellar sum theorem is known to be true in nonreflexive Banach spaces.

Data on the viability and persistence of species in landscapes altered by humans are scarce but an understanding of these dynamics is essential for enabling long-term species conservation in a modified world. Habitat loss, fragmentation and ensuing salinisation are of particular concern for species in Australia&#8217;s temperate agricultural regions where the rapid conversion of continuously vegetated landscapes to small fragments has occurred in less than 200 years. This thesis investigated the local and metapopulation structure of Heleioporus albopunctatus to determine the current population structure and likely future of this species in a highly degraded landscape: the wheat and sheep growing areas of southwestern Australia ... The life-history attributes of H. albopunctatus, including high fecundity, high adult longevity and low to moderate dispersal contribute to a robust regional metapopulation, responsive to changes, but with a strong chance of persistence over the long-term. H. albopunctatus appears to have adjusted to a radically modified landscape but its long-term persistence may be dependent on the existence of a small number of source populations that recruit in most years.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spotted frog -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Spotted frog -- Habitat -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Population genetics -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">Habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">Population biology</field><field name="subject">Metapopulation</field><field name="subject">Frog</field><field name="subject">Amphibian</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and management of bushland in Australian cities</field><field name="creator">Stenhouse, Renae N.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Native vegetation (bushland) in urban areas remains in small, isolated patches embedded within a matrix of human-dominated land uses.

The intercellular communication between these two cells is the quintessential mechanism in bone remodelling. Unfortunately, the importance of this interaction is often neglected and its significance is only realised when disruption of this &#8220;cross-talk&#8221; results in debilitating bone diseases. Additionally, the number of known proteins that are involved in this &#8220;cross-talk&#8221;, especially those that are osteoclast-derived, and act specifically on osteoblasts, is limited. This discrepancy leads to the question: Can osteoclasts directly control the growth and function of osteoblastic cells by expressing specific proteins that bind directly to osteoblasts? If so, is it possible to use these proteins to control and, possibly, treat bone disease? The objective of this thesis is to identify and characterise osteoclast-derived factors that can modulate bone homeostasis, as well as contribute to the intercellular communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts ... Collectively, the data in this thesis culminates in one important conclusion: the identification of a novel paracrine secretory factor that has the potential to directly induce the formation of bone. These findings represent the first ever characterisation of a protein that allows the osteoclasts to directly control the growth and function of osteoblasts.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important leguminous crop that is increasingly used in rotations with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Western Australia&#8217;s major crop. Chickpea and a range of other species exude P-mobilising carboxylates into the rhizosphere. Plants that exude carboxylates may need less P fertiliser or may use P in the soil that is unavailable to other plants. There is a wealth of information about P mobilisation and carboxylate exudation by white lupin; in contrast, research on carboxylate exudation by chickpea is fairly limited. The major aim of this PhD research project was to investigate the relationships between exudation of carboxylates and soil and plant P status for chickpea ... In conclusion, whereas carboxylate exudation of plants such as white lupin is clearly targeted at P acquisition, chickpea showed constitutive carboxylate exudation  mainly of malonate  into the rhizosphere in a series of experiments, each with a different design. Unlike white lupin, chickpea forms associations with mycorrhizal fungi that may improve plant P status.

Increasingly prevalent within the Australian mining industry are moves towards a riskbased philosophy instead of prescriptive design procedures. A barrier to this has been the lag in availability of resources (personnel and technical) required for the intensive effort of applying probabilistic methods to geotechnical engineering at mines ... One of the missing components for quantitative risk analysis in mines has been an accurate model of personnel exposure to geotechnical hazards, from which meaningful estimates can be made of the probabilities of serious or fatal injury given a rockfall. Exposure profiling for geotechnical risk analysis at minesites has traditionally involved the simple classification of travelways and entry areas by their occupancy rate, not taking into account traffic and work characteristics which may significantly influence the risks.

The site is an important colonial farm in Western Australia&#8217;s history; the location for the first farm in Western Australia (1827) and linked to many important individuals in the state&#8217;s colonial past. The site is owned and managed by the National Trust of Australia (W.A.) and is registered on both the West Australian, Heritage Council Register of Historical Places and the Australian Heritage Commission&#8217;s National Estate. Past historical and cultural biases had created an incomplete interpretation of this site that did not represent all social groups, including indentured servants, convict and Aboriginal labourers and women. The research has provided a holistic site interpretation that identified all social groups living and working on this site in the 1800s by analysing historical documents and archaeological excavated materials. The historical documentary record included both personal and official correspondence, diaries and drawings, as well as two valuable farm log books that documented the day to day events on the farm in the early to mid 1800s. The archaeological excavation was restricted to small area excavations in habitation areas still present on the site or in areas identified from 19th century surveyor maps. Both of these data sources were analysed to identify social and economic relationships, such as gender, status, class and ethnicity so that a comparison could be made between historical and archaeological data and a complementary interpretation created. The research was divided into three main periods of site occupation, firstly by convict gardeners during the government farm period from 1827 to 1832. The Spencer family period from 1833 to 1889, which is further defined by two phases, the six years from their arrival until Richard Spencer&#8217;s death in 1839 and the dispersal of the family and the property decline until it was sold in 1889. The third period of occupation by the Bird family was not discussed due to the discontinuation of a farming subsistence that distinguished it from a rural rather than an urban property. This study provides the current heritage managers with an updated interpretation of the site&#8217;s past and changing social and economic relationships on site and with the early town of Albany. It is hoped that this interpretation will be used to improve the site&#8217;s current representation and becomes the basis for a heritage conservation plan which not only recognises the importance of existing site structures, but also sub surface remains. This thesis also identifies a number of avenues for future research that will further enhance the site&#8217;s interpretation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strawberry Hill (Albany, W.A.) -- Antiquities</field><field name="subject">Farms -- Western Australia -- Albany -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Albany (W.A.) -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Historical archaeology</field><field name="subject">Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Western Australian history</field><field name="subject">Albany</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oceanographic forcing of phytoplankton dynamics in the coastal eastern Indian Ocean</field><field name="creator">Hanson, Christine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This work was the first large-scale biological oceanographic study to be undertaken in the coastal eastern Indian Ocean adjacent to Western Australia, and covered both northwest (Exmouth Peninsula to the Abrolhos Islands) and southwest (Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin) regions. The study area was dominated by the Leeuwin Current (LC), an anomalous eastern boundary current that transports tropical water poleward and prevents deep nutrients from reaching the surface by creating large-scale downwelling. Indeed, LC and offshore waters were consistently associated with low nitrate concentrations and low phytoplankton biomass and production (&lt; 200 mg C m-2 d-1). However, the physical forcing of the LC was offset, during the summer months, by upwelling associated with wind-driven inshore countercurrents (Ningaloo and Capes Currents), which provided a mechanism to access high nutrient concentrations normally confined to the base of the LC. ...  Limited seasonal investigations off the Capes region of southwestern Australia showed that the winter production scenario can be very different than summer conditions, with strong Leeuwin Current flow that meanders onto the continental shelf and entrains seasonally nutrient-enriched shelf waters. However, production in the LC was still low (&#8804;450 mg C m-2 d-1) due to light limitation resulting from both increased light attenuation and reduced surface irradiance characteristic of the winter months. This investigation provides fundamental knowledge on physical-biological coupling off Western Australia, with implications for fisheries management in view of seasonal and inter-annual variability in the strength of both the Leeuwin Current and inshore countercurrents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine phytoplankton -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Marine phytoplankton -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Oceanography -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Oceanography -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Primary production</field><field name="subject">Coastal upwelling</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Price discovery and information diffusion in the Perth housing market 1988-2000</field><field name="creator">Costello, Greg</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines informational efficiency and price discovery processes within the Perth housing market for the period 1988-2000 by utilising a rich source of Western Australian Valuer General&#8217;s Office (VGO) data. Fama&#8217;s (1970) classification of market efficiency as potentially weak form, semi-strong, or strong form has been a dominant paradigm in tests of market efficiency in many asset markets. While there are some parallels, the results of tests in this thesis suggest there are also limitations in applying this paradigm to housing markets. The institutional structure of housing markets dictates that a deeper recognition of important housing market characteristics is required. Efficiency in housing markets is desirable in that if prices provide accurate signals for purchase or disposition of real estate assets this will facilitate the correct allocation of scarce financial resources for housing services. The theory of efficient markets suggests that it is desirable for information diffusion processes in a large aggregate housing market to facilitate price corrections. In an efficient housing market, these processes can be observed and will enable housing units to be exchanged with an absence of market failure in all price and location segments. Throughout this thesis there is an emphasis on disaggregation of the Perth housing market both by price and location criteria. Results indicate that the Perth housing market is characterised by varying levels of informational inefficiency in both price and location segments and there are some important pricing-size influences.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing -- Prices -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Real property -- Prices -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Efficient market theory</field><field name="subject">Housing</field><field name="subject">House price index</field><field name="subject">Housing market efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching and learning about reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry</field><field name="creator">Ladhams Zieba, Meagan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study was carried out to investigate the teaching and learning processes occurring in the topic of reaction mechanisms in three tertiary level organic chemistry courses and focussed on investigating perceptions about the importance of teaching and learning about reaction mechanisms and about the difficult aspects of the topic ....

The students rarely achieved implicit outcomes anticipated by the lecturer. Lecturers demonstrate a tendency to use particular structural representations when discussing certain types of reaction process. The study identified that students commonly use these same types when working through particular reaction processes. In addition, it was found that the use of a particular structure could cue students into thinking about only one type of reaction process taking place in a given reaction. The use of language that is consistent with a consideration of only single reaction particles was also commonly observed in lectures. While this can be adequate in some circumstances, other aspects of reaction processes are better considered in terms of multiple reaction particles ...

In the male Merino sheep, nutrition is one of the most powerful factors that affect pulsatile LH secretion, used commonly to bioassay GnRH neuronal activity. More accurately, the reproductive system responds to &#8220;metabolic status&#8221;, rather than &#8220;nutrition&#8221;, and the three factors that contribute to metabolic status are food intake, the amount of body reserves and the rate of energy expenditure ... In this thesis, I tested the general hypothesis that the metabolic hormones and hypothalamic neuropeptides that are known to control food intake also mediate the effect of metabolic status on the activity of the GnRH neurons ...  In conclusion, the results from my experiments provide some insight into the mechanisms by which metabolic status affects reproductive activity in male sheep. Plasma insulin, which changes with alterations in metabolic status, appears to play a critical role in the regulation of GnRH neuronal activity. The level of leptin seems to have a permissive role only in lean animals. Orexins acting via OX2 receptors could be involved in the activation of reproductive function following an acute increase in nutrition.

Revegetation of bauxite residue sand (BRS) is problematic for a number of reasons. Harsh chemical conditions caused by residual NaOH from ore digestion mean plants must overcome extremely high pH (initially &gt;12), saline and sodic conditions. At such high pH, manganese (Mn) is rapidly oxidised from Mn2+ to Mn4+. Plants can take up only Mn2+. Thus, Mn deficiency is common in plants used for direct BRS revegetation, and broadcast Mn fertilisers have low residual value. Added to this, physical conditions of low water-holding capacity and a highly compactable structure make BRS unfavourable for productive plant growth without constant and large inputs of water as well as Mn. However, environmental regulations stipulate that the residue disposal area at Pinjarra, Western Australia, be revegetated to conform with surrounding land uses. The major land use of the area is pasture for grazing stock. Hence, pasture revegetation with minimum requirement for fertiliser and water application is desirable. This thesis investigates a number of avenues with potential for maintaining a productive pasture system on BRS whilst reducing the current level of Mn fertiliser and irrigation input.

Although many recent studies have made significant contributions in delineating the behaviour of these sediments, there is still paucity of information particularly on the cyclic behaviour of cemented calcareous soils. This thesis describes in detail the characteristic features of cemented calcareous soils and proposes methods for characterising their cyclic behaviour. Two different calcareous soils  Goodwyn (GW) and Ledge Point (LP) soils  representing extreme depositional environments were examined in this study. Artificially cemented sample were created using the CIPS (Calcite Insitu Precipitation Systems) technique, considering its superiority over other most commonly available cementation techniques in replicating the natural pattern of cementation, and the behaviour of natural calcarenite under monotonic loading conditions. The experimental program involved triaxial testing of both uncemented and calcite-cemented calcareous soils under different loading conditions, i.e. isotropic compression tests to high-pressure (16 MPa), monotonic shearing tests, undrained cyclic shearing tests and undrained monotonic post-cyclic shearing tests. Significant emphasis has been placed on the cyclic behaviour of these soils.

The present study was carried out to provide a basis for minimising environmental impact by providing a firm understanding of the soil properties that affect plant growth for soils developed from mining waste from the Wesfarmers Premier coalmine at Collie. The purpose of this study was to provide an understanding of the soil materials and to identify the potential interactions between soil properties and plants for soils developed on coalmine materials at the Premier mine, Collie. This research was to identify the nature of the manmade soils so as to determine if soil forming processes are active, to determine soil acidity including pH buffering capacity and the lime requirement of soils, to measure water retention characteristics and soil available water for plant growth, to relate soil properties to possible effects on plant growth, and to identify management strategies to improve soil conditions and overcome plant growth constraints. Seventy-seven manmade horizons from pits in 18 constructed soils, ranging from 9 to 21-years old, were analyzed throughout this study. These samples are classified based on soil depth, layer (topsoil and subsoil), and age of soil since rehabilitation. The methods for doing most of the analyses follow the Australian Soil and Land Survey handbook by Rayment and Higginson (1992). The results are presented quantitatively and soil properties are compared to provide information on pedogenic processes, the extent of soil development, the ability of the soils to resist degradation and to provide an indication of soil parent materials</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abandoned coal mines -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Collie</field><field name="subject">Abandoned mined lands reclamation -- Western Australia -- Collie</field><field name="subject">Mine soils -- Western Australia -- Collie</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Western Australia -- Collie</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anti-dynamic tube in mass flow silos</field><field name="creator">Nortje, Desiree</field><field name="description">Storage of granular solids in silos has been the practice for many years. Engineers have been faced with the problem of making the silos empty more efficiently and minimising the forces acting on the walls of the silo during material discharge. To this end the anti-dynamic tube was invented. The tube has a smaller diameter than the silo and consists of several portholes along its height and around its circumference. When the discharge gate of the silo is opened the granular material enters the tube through the portholes, flows down the inside of the tube and exits the silo through the discharge gate. Most tubes have been installed such that there was sufficient space between the base of the tube and silo bottom for the granular material to flow simultaneously through the discharge gate. The flowing material causes a down drag on the tube from the friction of the granular material on the walls of the tube. Previous research has underestimated the magnitude of these frictional forces resulting in catastrophic buckling failure of the tubes, blocking the discharge gate of the silo. A blockage of the discharge gate requires top emptying of the silo resulting in financial losses and down time of equipment. A steel model silo with an anti-dynamic tube was set up in the laboratory to measure the friction on the tube during material flow. From the results of these experiments, an equation has been derived to estimate the magnitude of the down-drag force. Furthermore, an empirical expression was developed for the effects of the speed of the flowing material on the magnitude of the down-drag force. To keep construction costs down, it is necessary to optimise the wall thickness of the tube. There is currently no theory for the buckling capacity of a thin walled cylindrical shell with multiple perforations around its height and circumference. Therefore additional experiments were undertaken on a cylindrical shell with multiple perforations subjected to a combination of an axial as well as an external lateral pressure. Following on from the experiments, finite element analyses were undertaken to compare with the experimental results. For each finite element analysis an out-of-roundness was introduced as an initial wall imperfection. From these analyses and the cylinder experiments, a method of producing interaction curves for tubes with varying ratios of open area has been developed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bulk solids flow</field><field name="subject">Silos -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Structural dynamics</field><field name="subject">Loading and unloading</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The degeneration of internal waves in lakes with sloping topography</field><field name="creator">Boegman, Leon</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Observations are presented from Lake Biwa (Japan) and Lake Kinneret (Israel) showing the ubiquitous and often periodic nature of high-frequency internal waves in large stratified lakes.

The self-regulation model posits that illness representations influence coping, and via coping, adaptive outcomes. In the adult literature, illness representations or perceptions of symptoms, cause, time-line, consequences and control of illness have been found to be important determinants of coping and adjustment. No study, however, has examined illness representations in relation to coping and adjustment in children with a chronic illness or their parents. A second goal was to examine the influence of parents on the coping processes of their children. One hundred and twenty-eight children (7-13 years) with asthma and their 120 primary caregivers (96% mothers) were individually interviewed regarding their illness representations, and completed self-report questionnaires of coping and psychological adjustment. For both children and parents, illness representations had a direct association with psychological adjustment that was not mediated by coping. Children and parents who considered the child&#8217;s asthma to be a serious condition with frequent symptoms and serious consequences reported poor psychological adjustment, over and above any effect of the clinical severity of the illness itself. Parental illness representations and adjustment were significantly related to these same variables for children. However, after controlling for relevant demographic/asthma variables in regression analyses, only children&#8217;s illness representations remained significantly associated with parental illness representations. Children who demonstrated more negative illness representations had parents who also held more negative beliefs about asthma. These findings suggest illness representations to be an important target for psychological interventions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma in children -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Parents of chronically ill children</field><field name="subject">Illness representations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive dysfunction underlying auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia : a combined-deficits model</field><field name="creator">Waters, Flavie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Auditory hallucinations are some of the most distressing and disabling symptoms of schizophrenia. However very little is known about the exact processes responsible for auditory hallucinations. The aim of this thesis is to provide a new perspective on the nature of the cognitive deficits underlying auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. As a preliminary study to the investigation of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia, a factor analysis of a measure of hallucinatory predisposition, the Launay- Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (Bentall &amp; Slade, 1985), was carried out on data from a large sample of undergraduate students (N = 562). An overlap in characteristics between hallucinatory-like experiences in normal individuals and auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia should draw attention to factors that are important to the hallucinatory experience in general. One of the findings from this study was that intrusiveness is a commonly reported characteristic of hallucinatory-like experiences in normal individuals. Intrusiveness is also one of the defining features of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Since the process of inhibition is essential for suppressing unwanted thoughts, the first set of two studies using patients with schizophrenia (N = 43) investigated the presence of an (intentional) inhibition failure in auditory hallucinations using the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT; Burgess &amp; Shallice, 1996) and the Inhibition of Currently Irrelevant Memories Task (ICIM; Schnider &amp; Ptak, 1999). It was found that auditory hallucinations were linked to a deficit in intentional inhibition as measured by these tasks. The process of inhibition was further investigated using the Affective Shifting task, but auditory hallucinations were not associated with a deficit on this task. Possible differences in the inhibitory demands of the HSCT, ICIM and Affective Shifting tasks are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Cognition disorders</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychiatry</field><field name="subject">Cognitive neuroscience</field><field name="subject">inhibition</field><field name="subject">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the dynamic angle of gait and radiographic characteristics of the first metatarsophalangeal joint in subjects with hallux limitus</field><field name="creator">Taranto, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Limitation of sagittal plane dorsiflexion, or hallux limitus (HL), represents the second most commonly encountered pathomechanical disorder affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint, after hallux valgus (HV). The kinematic role of the first metatarsophalangeal joint represents an integral component of the gait cycle. It has often been reported that for adequate leverage and propulsion to occur during normal gait, the hallux must be able to dorsiflex approximately 65&#176; on the head of the first metatarsal. Secondary gait compensation mechanisms have often been observed clinically as a result of HL. The effect of HL on gait can be reflected in transverse plane alteration of the foot in relation to the line of progression during gait, defined as the angle of gait (AOG). The first purpose of this study served to investigate potential differences in dynamic angle of gait AOG in subjects with HL compared to a control group. A validated technique using coloured powdered footprints was used to quantify AOG. Furthermore, it was required to establish whether the relative amount of transverse plane motion observed in the AOG was related to factors intrinsic or extrinsic to the foot. Intrinsic factors such as the amount of forefoot to rearfoot abduction was considered, and achieved by measuring the rearfoot to forefoot axis (RFA) angle using a weight bearing composite (COMP) view radiograph. The remaining objectives of the study served to investigate other common aetiological factors associated with HL and their potential influence on AOG in subjects with HL ...   Results further indicated that the amount of first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsiflexion did not appear to influence AOG in the two groups, and that AOG did not reflect the iii amount of forefoot to rearfoot abduction in a foot with HL compared to the control group. When comparing foot type, as indicated by CIA, it appeared AOG did not significantly alter between the HL and control groups. Finally, the results indicated AOG did not differ significantly between subjects with unilateral HL. This thesis study indicated that with the current sample population, the wide variability in AOG prevented detection of any subtle differences that may exist in subjects with HL. Results also emphasised the need to incorporate other variables such as symptomology and foot dominance when considering the effects first metatarsophalangeal joint pathology might have on HL, such as AOG.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metatarsus -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Toes -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Gait disorders</field><field name="subject">Dynamic</field><field name="subject">First metatarsophalangeal joint</field><field name="subject">Angle of gait</field><field name="subject">Hallux limitus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of dynamic angle of gait and radiographic features in subjects with hallux valgus</field><field name="creator">Taranto, Julie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Hallux valgus (HV) is one of the most common foot deformities encountered in clinical practice. This complex deformity primarily affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ), leading to altered foot structure and function. By virtue of the lateral displacement of the hallux on the first metatarsal, HV has the potential to influence adjacent joints of the foot. In doing so, function of the foot may be altered, and clinically this may result in abduction of the foot during the stance phase of gait. However the relationship between an abducted angle of gait (AOG) and HV has never been substantially examined. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between HV and AOG, and determine if specific radiographic features are associated with the deformity or with a particular AOG. Such information would assist in understanding aetiological factors and the effects of intervention to treat the deformity ...  Length and elevation of the first metatarsal were associated in subjects with HV, implying that length of the metatarsal may be related to whether or not it becomes elevated (R: 0.50, CI: 0.21, 0.71, P&lt; 0.05). Similarly, an association was found between length of the first metatarsal and the amount of first MPJ dorsiflexion, suggesting perhaps length of the metatarsal has implications for first MPJ range of motion (R: -0.37, CI: -0.62, -0.04, P&lt;0.05). However the amount of first MPJ dorsiflexion did not influence the AOG in HV subjects when compared to the control group. First MPJ dorsiflexion was also associated with the first intermetatarsal angle. Interestingly, the HV group alone did not show an association between the hallux abductus angle and the first intermetatarsal angle. The findings of this study are contrary to those suspected in clinical practice and alluded to in the literature. Despite the documented support for the biomechanical causes of HV, an abducted AOG was not significantly different in HV subjects when compared to controls. Possible explanations may have related to limitations of the present study including the size and gender demographics of the sample population, and greater variability in normal AOG ranges than reported in the literature. The present study indicated a possible need to gather information regarding foot dominance and leg length; factors extrinsic to the foot capable of influencing transverse plane orientation of the foot; and, the influence of symptoms and subsequent compensatory mechanisms adopted during gait.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hallux valgus</field><field name="subject">Gait disorders</field><field name="subject">Toes -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Angle of gait</field><field name="subject">Radiographic features</field><field name="subject">Abduction</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of high energy milling on the performance of silicate rock fertilizers</field><field name="creator">Priyono, Joko</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Many researchers have proposed the use of silicate rock fertilizers (SRFs) as alternatives to chemical fertilizers. However, the application of SRFs in modern agricultural practices is limited due mainly to the slow release of plant-nutrient elements from SRFs and consequently many tonnes/ha of SRFs may need to be applied. Simple and inexpensive methods of modifying the physicochemical properties of SRFs are needed to improve the agronomic effectiveness of SRFs. This thesis is focused on the evaluation of high-energy milling to produce superfine particles to improve the effectiveness of mafic (basalt and dolerite) and felsic (gneiss and K-feldspar) rocks for use as fertilizers. The ground mafic rocks are for use as Ca and Mg fertilizers and the ground felsic rocks as K fertilizers. Laboratory and glasshouse experiments were conducted with several potential SRFs. In laboratory experiments, initially milled rocks (&#216;&lt; 250 &#956;m for basalt, dolerite, and gneiss; &#216; &lt; 150 &#956;m for K-feldspar) were further milled with a ball mill (Spex-8000) for 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min under dry and wet (rock/water ratio = 1/3) conditions. To investigate possible reaction between constituents, other subsamples of initially milled basalt, dolerite, and gneiss were added to reagent grade NaCl or KCl (4.5 g rock + 0.5 g NaCl or KCl) and milled for 120 min under dry and wet conditions. Basalt and dolerite were also mixed with K-feldspar at a ratio of 1 : 1 and milled for 120 min under dry and wet conditions. For use in the glasshouse experiment, the initially milled rocks were further milled with a vertical stirred ball mill for 1 h in a dry condition. The elemental and mineralogical compositions of the SRFs were determined using XRF and XRD. Effects of milling on major physicochemical properties of milled rocks were determined, including particle size (Malvern Mastersizer), surface area (BET-N2), quantities of amorphous constituents (XRD, oxalic acid-oxalate extraction, TEM), extractable cations (1M CH3COONH4 pH 7), pHH2O, and electric conductivity. Dissolution kinetics in 0.01M acetic-citric acids (for 56 days) and soil (for 10 months) were determined. Based on the results of these laboratory experiments, a glasshouse experiment was carried out for 12 months to evaluate the effects of SRF application on growth and nutrient uptake of ryegrass grown on several soils. Milling reduced particle size, enhanced amorphism, and increased the release of structural cations from the rocks, with the effects due to dry milling being greater than for wet milling. The optimum milling times which produced maximum amounts of exchangeable cations (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) were 30 - 90 min, depending on rock type.

Please see the pdf version of the abstract for the complete text.]  Thirty impact structures of confirmed or possible status are currently identified in Australia. Twenty-two of these structures are confirmed by the presence of meteorite fragments or shock metamorphic features that are diagnostic of meteorite impact. The remainder have an impact origin supported by strong secondary evidence. New impact structures are being discovered in Australia at a rate of about one every year, with geophysics a key tool in the identification of candidate structures for further investigation. It is estimated that between two and five times the current number of impact structures are yet to be discovered on the Australian continent. Past compilations of the geophysical signatures of impact structures, particularly of their potential field responses, have been focused on structures formed in mainly crystalline targets. From these studies the expected gravity response is an overall low due to fracturing of the target rocks, with a local gravity high common over the centre of large complex structures, due to the structural uplift of denser material. An overall demagnetisation of the target rocks by the high shock pressures generated by the impact is also expected, although central magnetic highs may also be produced by remanently magnetised melt or the uplift of magnetic rocks from depth. The geophysical signatures of fifteen Australian impact structures are discussed, including individual case studies on nine structures and a detailed study of the Yallalie structure. Only one of the structures discussed here was formed in crystalline rocks, with a further two in mixed sedimentary / crystalline targets. The other structures that were studied were formed in either Phanerozoic basins or mildly-deformed Proterozoic sedimentary rocks. The potential field responses of these structures show a greater variability than was expected, particularly between structures that were formed in different types of target rock. A positive gravity response is found over four structures formed in clastic sedimentary rocks deposited in a Phanerozoic basin. These anomalies are due to the emplacement of denser rock into the central uplift. A decrease in density due to brecciation is not apparent in this target rock type. Furthermore, it is suggested that by collapsing pore space and removing water, the density of wet sedimentary rocks may be locally increased by impact. Circular magnetic anomalies are found outside the central uplift of six impact structures formed in either Phanerozoic or weakly-metamorphosed Proterozoic sedimentary basins.Four possible sources for these anomalies are proposed; remanently magnetised melt or suevite surrounding the central uplift, creation of new magnetic minerals along internal faults within the crater by post-impact hydrothermal fluids, deformation of a flat-lying magnetic layer within the target stratigraphy, and magnetic (maghemite, heavy minerals) minerals concentrated within the post-impact crater fill. It is not possible to definitively identify an impact crater from geophysical evidence alone. Consequently, candidate structures selected from geophysical data, even those as strongly supported as Silverpit, should not be given equal status to structures that have been proven beyond doubt by diagnostic geological criteria. However, it is proposed that structures that possess several pieces of secondary evidence, such as circular shape, interpretation of characteristic geophysical features and crater morphometry, be reclassified as &#8220;provisional&#8221; impact structures and be given a status that is between &#8220;possible&#8221; and &#8220;probable&#8221;. A global compilation of the natural resources known to be associated with impact structures has been undertaken. Where possible, an economic value is calculated for the total definable resource for each structure. The prospectivity of impact structures for petroleum, mineral or water resources is reconfirmed by this work. Almost 20% of all known terrestrial impact structures are associated with some form of resource that is, or has been, exploited. The most numerous, and generally most valuable, of these resources are hydrocarbon accumulations stored in structural traps or brecciated rocks within, or around, the structure. The structural displacements resulting from crater formation can expose from beneath cover, or preserve from erosion, a pre-existing, or progenetic, mineral deposit. While the massive base-metal deposits of the Sudbury Mining Camp are perhaps the most famous of all impact-related economic resources, they require the preservation of the melt sheet formed by a very large (&gt;150 km diameter) impact structure. The Sudbury mineralisation is probably unique on the Earth, but may be a valid target for metal exploration on other planets. Other types of natural resource include surface or ground water, deposits of chemical or organic-rich sedimentary material, hydrothermal ores and industrial diamonds.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meteorite craters -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Prospecting -- Geophysical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative grazing systems and pasture types for the South West of Western Australia : a bio-economic analysis</field><field name="creator">Sounness, Marcus Neil</field><field name="description">Alternative grazing systems and pasture types for wool production in the south west of Western Australia were analysed using bio-economic modelling techniques in order to determine their relative productivity and profitability. After reviewing the experimental and modelling literature on perennial pastures and grazing systems, seven case studies of farmers were conducted in order to investigate the practical application of innovative grazing systems and use of perennial pastures. Together these case studies provided information for identifying relevant variables and for calibrating the modelling work which followed. The core of the work lies in a bio-economic model for investigating the comparative value of the three grazing systems and two pasture families mentioned above. A baseline scenario using currently available and reliable scientific data provides baseline results, after which a number of sensitivity analyses provide further insights using variations of four key parameters: persistence, heterogeneity, water soluble carbohydrates, and increased losses. Results show that perennial pastures are in the studied region more profitable than annual pastures. Under current baseline conditions, continuous grazing with perennial pastures is the most profitable enterprise, but this superiority is not robust under parameter variations defined by other scenarios. The more robust solution in terms of enterprise profitability is cell grazing with perennial pastures. The results indicate that intensive grazing systems such as cell grazing have the potential to substantially increase the profitability of grazing operations on perennial pasture. This result is an encouraging one in light of its implications for water uptake and salinity control. It means that economics and land care can go hand in hand, rather than be competitive. It is to be noted that it is the choice of the grazing system in combination with the pasture species, rather then the pasture species itself, that allows for such complementarity between economics and sustainable land use. This research shows that if farmers adopt practices such as cell grazing they may be able to increase the area that they can profitably plant to perennial pasture thus reducing the impacts of dryland salinity. This finding is consistent with the findings of the case studies where the farmers perceived that, provided grazing was planned, increasing the intensity of their grazing management and the perenniallity of their pastures would result in an increase in the profitability of their grazing operation. As a result this research helps to bridge a gap which has existed in this area of research, between the results of scientific research and those reported in practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grazing -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Grazing -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Pastures -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Pastures -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Salinization -- Control -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Grazing management</field><field name="subject">Perennial pasture</field><field name="subject">Rotational grazing</field><field name="subject">Bio-economic modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical power output and neuromuscular activity during and following recovery from repeated-sprint exercise in man</field><field name="creator">Mendez Villanueva, Alberto</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to examine the time-course of mechanical power output and neuromuscular activity during fatiguing repeated-sprint exercise and recovery in man. Prior to the main study, we also investigated the reproducibility of power output during a single 6-s cycling sprint. For this study, eleven healthy moderately trained males performed a 6-s standing sprint on the front-access cycle ergometer on four separate occasions. The results of the study showed that reliable power outputs can be obtained after one familiarization session in subjects unfamiliar with maximal cycling sprint exercise. However, the inclusion of an extra familiarization session ensured more stable power outputs. Therefore, two trials should allow adequate familiarization with the maximal 6-s cycling test. For the main study, eight young moderately trained adult men performed an exercise protocol that consisted of ten, 6-s sprints on a wind-braked cycle ergometer interspersed with 30 s of recovery. After 6 min of passive recovery, five, 6-s sprints were repeated, again interspersed by 30 s of recovery. Peak power output (PPO) and mean power output (MPO) were measured during each sprint and EMG data (i.e., RMS) from the vastus lateralis muscle were also recorded. A one-way ANOVA with repeated measures (i.e., sprint number) was used to allocate the significant differences in each dependent variable over time. Analysis revealed a decline in power output during the fatiguing exercise that was accompanied by a decrease in EMG amplitude of the vastus lateralis muscle. Six minutes after the fatiguing exercise, power output during sprint 11 significantly recovered with respect to values recorded in sprint 10, but remained significantly lower than that recorded in the initial sprint. Thus, 6 min was insufficient to fully recover from the fatiguing repeated sprint protocol utilised in this study. The main findings in the present study were that: 1) the partial recovery of power output in sprint 11 was not accompanied by the recovery V of EMG amplitude; 2) similar mean power outputs were recorded during sprint 4 and 11 despite a significantly lower EMG activity recorded during the latter sprint; and 3) despite comparable mean power outputs during sprint 4 and 11, the decrease in power output over the next five sprints was greater for sprints 11 to 15 than for sprints 4 to 8.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sprinting -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular transmission</field><field name="subject">Muscle strength</field><field name="subject">Power output</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular activity</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Output</field><field name="subject">Repeated sprints</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active control of fan noise and vortex shedding</field><field name="creator">Wong, Yee-Jun</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The subject of fan noise generating mechanisms and its control has been studied intensively over the past few decades as a result of the ever-increasing demand for more powerful fans. A unique feature of fan noise is that it consists of high-level discrete frequency noise related to the blade passing frequency, and low-level broadband noise due mostly to turbulent airflow around the fan. Of the two types of fan noise, the discrete frequency noise is the more psychologically annoying component. Past research into fan noise has shown that the discrete frequency fan noise are dipole in nature and are caused predominantly by the fluctuating lift acting on the surfaces of the fan blades. Based on this, several theoretical models have been established to correlate these fluctuating lift forces to the far-field sound pressure. However, one general assumption in these models is that the fan blades are assumed rigid, and the consequence of such an assumption is that it is unclear if the far-field sound pressure is caused solely by the aerodynamic lift force, or whether the blade vibration also plays a substantial role in the generation of the far-field fan noise. One of the goal of this thesis was thus to experimentally quantify the contribution of blade vibration to far-field fan noise and it was found that blade vibration, whilst coherent with the far-field fan noise, did not contribute significantly. Aside of this, several experiments aimed at filling knowledge gaps in the understanding of fan noise characteristics were also be conducted, in particular, to understand the relationship between far-field sound pressure level to blade lengths as well as the number of blades on the fan. The experiments showed that for fans with many blades, the dependency of the far-field sound pressure on blade length is stronger than fans with less blades. Furthermore, dipole measurements showed that the dipole characteristics of fan noise does not occur only at the discrete frequencies, but also within a range of broadband frequencies, implying that the source for both discrete and broadband is the same. The second section of this thesis deals with the study of vortex shedding and its active control. When a circular cylinder (or any object) is placed in a flow within a specified Reynolds number range, flow separation and periodical wake motion is formed behind the cylinder, which is known as vortex shedding. It has been found in previous research that this wake motion is affected by acoustic field imposed on it via loudspeakers. This suggests that there is a strong acoustic-vortex relationship. However, little of this relationship is understood as conventional methods of studying vortex centre around the use of hot-wire anemometry, which effectively measures the velocity fluctuation in the flow. This thesis is the first in using a microphone to study the acoustic characteristic of the vortex wake, and experimental results shows that the two parallel shear layers of the wake carry the strongest pressure signals at the vortex shedding frequency, whilst the entrapped region between the layers carries the strongest pressure signals at the first harmonic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fans (Machinery) -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Vortex-motion</field><field name="subject">Fan noise</field><field name="subject">Vortex shedding</field><field name="subject">Active noise control</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural chemistry of copper(1) / pnicogen-ligand adducts</field><field name="creator">Somers, Neil</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  Group 15 Lewis base adducts of Group 11 coinage metal salts of the form MX : L (1:n), where M=Cu(I),Ag(I),Au(I); X=(pseudo-)halide (Cl,Br,I,SCN,CN) and oxyanion;  L-uni- or bi-dentate pnicogen ligand and n=1-4, may adopt monomeric, dimeric, oligomeric or polymeric structural forms.  For the purpose of this study, the pnicogen bases are divided into two groups:  the 'harder' nitrogen base ligands and 'softer' phosphine/arsine/stibine ligands.  A sizeable body of structural data exits for adducts of silver(I) salts.  Those with uni-dentate nitrogen base ligands are usually restricted to readily accessible liquid bases such as pyridine and its derivatives.  The extension of such series to encompass ligands with more varied base characteristics may assist in the access of new bonding modes and stereochemistry, leading to control of these and of stoichiometry.  Herein a number of complexes of copper(I) salts with uni-dentate nitrogen and bi-dentate phosphine/arsine/stibine adducts with differing degrees of complexity have been characterized, extending the known range of structural forms.  Systematic variations in stoichiometry, halide, ligand and solvent of crystallization have provided a range of complexes whose structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques.  The structural relationship between these and other known adducts, often including their silver analogues, are considered, permitting comparisons of various common features and differences.  The first section of this thesis (Chapter 3 and Chapter 4) reports a number of complexes of the form CuX : L (1:n) (CuX)Ln, L=uni-dentate nitrogen base ligand with n=1-3, the second section (Chapter 5 through Chapter 10) reports adducts with bi-dentate bis(diphenylpnicogeno)alkane ligands, Ph2E(CH2)xEPh2 (whereE=P,AS,Sb and x=1-6).  The structural types and copper(I) coordination environments are influenced by CuX (salt) : ligand stoichiometry, the stereochemistry and basicity of the ligand, the type and size of the counter-ion (where applicable) and crystallization solvent.  The structural types found for copper(I) (pseudo-)halide and oxyanion species are similar to those found for their silver(I) analogues, although the transitions between structural types may occur with different pnicogen and halide atoms, consequent on the smaller size of the copper(I) ion and differences in stereochemical preferences.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copper salts -- Structure</field><field name="subject">Copper compounds -- Structure</field><field name="subject">Ligands -- Structure</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography and population genetic structure of the Australian sea lion, neophoca cinerea</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Richard</field><field name="description">The Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, is Australia?s only endemic pinniped, and one of the rarest sea lions in the world. This species suffered localised extinction events, and a probable population decline during the commercial sealing era of the 18th to 20th centuries. This species also has a unique reproductive cycle and breeding system compared with all other pinnipeds. Unlike the usual annual, synchronous cycle, this species has a 17.5 month breeding cycle which is asynchronous across its range. Small groups of proximate colonies appear to breed synchronously, but otherwise the timing appears randomly distributed. It was proposed that this system is endogenously controlled and maintained by exclusive female natal site fidelity (Gales et al. 1994). This would have a discernible impact on the population genetic structure, and would be directly applicable to conservation management practices. Investigation of population genetic structure of the Australian sea lion using mtDNA and microsatellite markers revealed a highly subdivided population that showed strong patterns of sex-biased dispersal, and strong regional divisions. The level of female natal site fidelity was extreme, resulting in very high levels of genetic differentiation, unparalleled in other marine mammal populations. Significant divisions existed across both macro and micro geographic scales, with fixed differences occurring between colonies separated by as little as 20 kilometres. Strong phylogeographic patterning suggested that divisions between populations are of some antiquity. High levels of fixation in mtDNA markers among the many small colonies in Western Australia was attributed to the high rate of genetic drift in small populations, especially for these markers. Genetic subdivison, as measured by microsatellite markers, revealed a malebiased dispersal pattern. Levels of male dispersal were sufficient in overcoming the female natal site fidelity and rendering small groups of colonies effectively panmictic. However, the range of male dispersal was limited to approximately 200 kilometres and resulted in a regional population structure best defined by geographic distance. This level of subdivision was perhaps greater than expected given the dispersal capabilities of this species, and suggested that some behavioural processes may limit dispersal. Historical processes of extinction and colonisation are thought to have had a strong influence on the current pattern of population subdivision as well.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sea lions -- Genetics -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Sea lions -- Australia -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Sea lions -- Population viability analysis -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between global integration and performance in multinational professional engineering companies</field><field name="creator">Osegowitsch, Thomas</field><field name="description">This study investigates the link between global integration -- defined as the intra-firm cross-border transfer of operational resources -- and performance in multinational professional engineering companies. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, we find some support for a positive association. We review two bodies of scholarship germane to our topic: the global integration - performance literature and the multinationality - performance literature. The inclusion of the latter is justified since the espoused performance benefits of multinationality are predominantly realised through global integration. Based upon an evaluation of these two bodies of scholarship and qualitative insights, we propose a positive relationship between global integration and performance as well as a mediating relationship, with global integration acting as a mediator between multinationality and performance. Hypothesis testing is performed in Partial Least Squares, a structural equation modelling technique ideally suited for small samples. Results reveal a significant positive association between global integration and MNC profitability. A separate research model testing the relationship between global integration and the alternative dependent, MNC growth, is rejected. Further analysis of the profitability-based research model provides support for the mediational hypothesis: the relationship between multinationality and profitability is fully mediated, suggesting no gains from multinationality per se. Supplementary tests reveal that the profitability effects of global integration are enhanced when it is strongly motivated by the desire to take advantage of specialised skills within the MNC; no such claim of moderation can be made when global integration is strongly motivated by a desire to improve staff utilisation on a global basis. The relationship between global integration and profitability is also unaffected by the origins (headquarters vs. subsidiaries) of the intra-firm operational resource transfers that constitute global integration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International business enterprises -- Management</field><field name="subject">Intra-firm trade</field><field name="subject">Engineering firms -- Management</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vivo measurement and imaging of ferrimagnetic particle concentrations in biological tissues</field><field name="creator">Pardoe, Heath</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners were used to investigate the measurement and imaging of ferrimagnetic particle concentrations in biological tissues in vivo. The presence of ferrimagnetic particles tends to increase the proton transverse relaxation rate (R2) of water protons in tissue. A quantitative image of R2 can be generated using a series of single spin echo magnetic resonance images acquired using clinical MRI scanners and analysing the images using techniques based on that reported by Clark and St. Pierre (2000). If ferrimagnetic particles have a high enough concentration, there is a monotonic relationship between particle concentration and R2; therefore an image of R2 gives a map of the ferrimagnetic particle concentration in the tissue. These techniques were used to investigate the feasibility of in vivo measurement of the concentration and distribution of both synthetic and biogenic ferrimagnetic particles in tissue. Rabbit liver was loaded with ferrimagnetic particles of ?-Fe2O3 (designed for magnetic hyperthermia treatment of liver tumours) by injecting various doses of a suspension of the particles into the hepatic artery in vivo. R2 images of the livers in vivo, excised, and dissected were generated from a series of single spin-echo images. Mean R2 values for samples of ferrimagnetic-particle-loaded liver dissected into approximate 1 cm cubes were found to linearly correlate with tissue iron concentration over the range from approximately 0.1 to at least 2.7 mg Fe/g dry tissue when measured at room temperature. Changing the temperature of ferrimagnetic-particle-loaded samples of liver from 1?C to 37?C had no observable effect on tissue R2 values. However, a small but significant decrease in R2 was found for control samples containing no ferrimagnetic material on raising the temperature from 1?C to 37?C. Both chemically measured iron ii concentrations and mean R2 values for rabbit livers with implanted tumours tended to be higher than those measured for tumour-free liver. This study indicates that tissue R2 measurement and imaging by nuclear magnetic resonance may have a useful role in magnetic hyperthermia therapy protocols for the treatment of liver cancer. In order to investigate the use of clinical MRI scanners to measure biogenic ferrimagnetic particle concentrations in human brain tissue, agar gel based phantoms containing ferrimagnetic particles were made in order to determine the lower concentration detection limit for such particles in a homogenous medium. Magnetite/maghemite nanoparticles were synthesized in the presence of either dextran or polyvinyl alcohol, yielding cluster- and necklace-like aggregates, respectively. Magnetization, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and microscopy measurements indicated that the arrangement of the particles within the aggregates affects the magnetic properties of the particles resulting in smaller particles in the clusters having higher superparamagnetic blocking temperatures than larger particles in the necklaces.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Magnetite</field><field name="subject">Proton transverse relaxation rate imaging</field><field name="subject">Biomineralisation</field><field name="subject">Biogenic magnetite</field><field name="subject">Magnetic nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Liver</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of labour supply and fertility behaviour : a study of Australian women</field><field name="creator">Birch, Elisa Rose</field><field name="description">There are many potential determinants of women?s labour supply including wages, unearned income, human capital endowments, demographic characteristics and family traits.

R.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The Tintina Gold Province (TGP) comprises numerous (&lt;15) gold belts and districts throughout interior Alaska and Yukon that are associated with Cretaceous plutonic rocks. With a gold endowment of &#8764;70Moz, most districts are defined by their placer gold contributions, which comprise greater than 30 Moz, but four districts have experience significant increases in gold exploration with notable discoveries at Fort Knox (5.4 Moz), Donlin Creek (12.3 Moz), Pogo (5.8 Moz), True North (0.79 Moz), and Brewery Creek (0.85 Moz). All significant TGP gold deposits are spatially and temporally related to reduced (ilmenite-series) and radiogenic Cretaceous intrusive rocks that intrude (meta-) sedimentary strata. The similar characteristics that these deposits share are the foundation for the development of a reduced intrusion-related gold deposit model. Associated gold deposits have a wide variety of geological and geochemical features and are categorized as intrusion-centered (includes intrusion-hosted, skarns and replacements), shear-related, and epizonal. The TGP is characterized by vast, remote under-explored areas, unglaciated regions with variable oxidation depths and discontinuous permafrost, which, in combination with a still-evolving geological model, create significant exploration challenges. Twenty-five Early and mid-Cretaceous (145-90 Ma) plutonic suites and belts are defined across Alaska and Yukon on the basis of lithological, geochemical, isotopic, and geochronometric similarities. These features, when combined with aeromagnetic characteristics, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and whole-rock ferric:ferrous ratios define the distribution of magnetite- and ilmenite-series plutonic belts. Magnetite-series plutonic belts are dominantly associated with the older parts of the plutonic episode and comprise subduction-generated metaluminous plutons that are distributed preferentially in the more seaward localities dominated by primitive tectonic elements. Ilmenite-series plutonic belts comprise slightly-younger, slightly-peraluminous plutons in more landward localities in pericratonic to continental margin settings. They were likely initiated in response to crustal thickening following terrane collision. The youngest plutonic belt forms a small, but significant, magnetite-series belt in the farthest inboard position, associated with alkalic plutons that were emplaced during weak extension. Intrusion-related metallogenic provinces with distinctive metal associations are distributed, largely in accord with classical redox-sensitive granite-series. Copper, Au and Fe mineralisation are associated with magnetite-series plutons and tungsten mineralisation associated with ilmenite-series plutons. However, there are some notable deviations from expected associations, as intrusion-related Ag-Pb-Zn deposits are few, and significant tin mineralisation is rare. Most significantly, many gold deposits and occurrences are associated with ilmenite-series plutons which form the basis for the reduced intrusion-related gold deposit model</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural -- Yukon Territory</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural -- Alaska</field><field name="subject">Intrusions (Geology) -- Yukon Territory</field><field name="subject">Intrusions (Geology) -- Alaska</field><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Yukon Territory</field><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Alaska</field><field name="subject">Magmatism -- Yukon Territory</field><field name="subject">Magmatism -- Alaska</field><field name="subject">Metallogeny -- Yukon Territory</field><field name="subject">Metallogeny -- Alaska</field><field name="subject">Intrusion-related</field><field name="subject">Cretaceous</field><field name="subject">Plutonism</field><field name="subject">Yukon</field><field name="subject">Alaska</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental study of a scanning laser doppler flowmeter</field><field name="creator">Townsend, Russell James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Purpose: To improve our ability to interpret and validate Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (HRF) flow images by recording flow measurements from specific regions of the retinal vasculature in in-vitro and in-vivo eye models in which retinal blood flow can be manipulated. Methods: The first experiments utilised an isolated perfused pig eyes perfused with a 50%/50% Krebs/RBC solution at known flow rates ranging from zero to 300 &#956;l/min. After HRF image acquisition, the retinal vasculature was perfused with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), for fluorescence microscopy. Using the standard HRF software and a 10&#215;10 pixel measurement window, flow rates were measured from a retinal artery, vein, arteriole, venule, and the retinal capillary bed and a capillary-free-zone. The relationship between HRF measured flow and perfusion flow in the different measurement regions was determined. For the second study, HRF flow images were acquired at retinal sites in Brown Norway rats over a range of focus levels before and after cessation of retinal blood flow by laser-induced central retinal artery occlusion. Using the 10&#215;10 pixel and 4&#215;4 pixel measurement windows, HRF measured flow was performed in retinal artery, vein, arteriole, capillary and choroidal vessel locations. The relationship between HRF measured flow and focus depth was determined for each location before and after central retinal artery occlusion. At the conclusion of each experiment the effect of reduction of systemic blood pressure (by exsanguination) on HRF flow measurements in choroidal vessels and in locations without visible choroidal vessels was assessed. Finally, HRF flow measurements were acquired after euthanasia, to determine the HRF flow signal which was still present under zero biological flow conditions (the zerooffset). Results: In the isolated perfused pig eye experiments it was found that the HRF flow response varied according to vascular location. At zero perfusate flow, HRF flow was consistently greater than zero at all locations, averaging 171.9 &#177; 44.7 AU (n=97), representing background noise. Arteries and veins yielded the highest HRF measured flow values, but the relationship between HRF measured flow and perfusate flow was not linear. In arterioles the HRF flow was more linear over a broader range of perfusate flow rates but the peak flow signal was an order of magnitude smaller than that in arteries and veins. Both the linearity and magnitude of the flow signal in venules was less than that in arterioles.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laser Doppler blood flowmetry</field><field name="subject">Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy</field><field name="subject">Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental response to burrowing seabird colonies : a study in ecosystem engineering</field><field name="creator">Bancroft, Wesley J.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Ecosystem engineers are organisms that physically modify habitat in a manner that modulate resource flows and species within ecosystems.

Aqueous ethanol solutions were recirculated through the inner volume of the silicone polymer tubing in the mat, to allow permeation and delivery of ethanol by diffusion through the tubing walls to a target contamination zone. The aim of the system was to provide control over subsurface geochemistry by overcoming carbon source limitations, and as a result stimulate indigenous bacteria to remove contaminants. The physical properties of the silicone tubing were initially characterised, which included the determination of the ethanol sorption and diffusion properties of the tubing. A model for the mass of ethanol transferred via diffusion from an aqueous solution on the inner volume of a length of polymer tubing was developed to enable prediction of the ethanol delivery capacity of the silicone polymer mats. A number of large-scale laboratory column studies were then conducted to validate this ethanol mass delivery model, and to evaluate the use of silicone polymer mats to deliver ethanol and promote the biodegradation of a range of different contaminated groundwaters. The laboratory column experiments were observed to produce ethanol mass flux delivery statistically similar to that predicted by the model; however this was only with the application of an effective diffusion coefficient within the model, which was determined from the model under subsurface-simulated conditions. Ethanol delivery using the silicone tubing polymer mat system was also quantified in a pilot field-scale demonstration. The mass of ethanol delivery in the field was shown to be within the range of model-predicted ethanol delivery; however delivery was not as consistent and predictable as that observed in the column studies. Successful ethanol enhanced nitrate contamination removal (via denitrification) was observed at a field scale. For field applications, this innovative polymer mat amendment delivery system may provide targeted, predictable and cost-effective amendment delivery compared to aqueous injection methods for groundwater bioremediation, however, knowledge and quantification of the hydrogeology of the particular field site is required. Two other ethanol-driven biologically-mediated contaminant removal processes were also investigated in the laboratory-scale soil column studies, and included the assessment of the removal of dissolved metals/sulfate via sulfate reduction and metalsulfide precipitation, and the removal of trichloroethene via reductive dechlorination.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Purification</field><field name="subject">Bioremediation</field><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Biological treatment</field><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Fixed-film biological process</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of partial-flow operation on the axial vibration of double-suction centrifugal pumps</field><field name="creator">Hodkiewicz, Melinda R.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Centrifugal pumps are designed to operate at a capacity that maximizes the efficiency of the pump. Operation below this design capacity results in reduction of pump efficiency as the geometric configuration of the impeller and casing no longer provide an ideal flow pattern. Consequently there are changes in the flow field within the pump, including flow separation and regions of localized, non-uniform, unsteady flow. This flow interacts with rotating and stationary components inside the pump creating additional disturbance and hydraulic excitation. It is anticipated that the local hydrodynamic and global hydroacoustic excitation due to partial-flow operation will affect the structural vibration measured on the pump. In this study, the effects of partial-flow operation on the vibration signal at the pump bearing housing are measured on a number of industrial double-suction pump units. These are a particular class of centrifugal pump commonly used in high volume applications such as water distribution. The aims are to understand how the vibration signals change at the different operating conditions and to determine which parameters are best suited to monitoring the observed changes. Comparison is made between the response, under similar operating conditions, of pumps both within sets of identical size and design, across sets of similar design and different sizes, and between different designs. The pumps are all in-service industrial units. In double-suction pumps the impeller motion in the axial direction (along the line of the shaft) is not constrained. Due to symmetry in impeller design, axial stability is maintained by equal and opposite hydraulic forces on the two opposing sides of the impeller. The potential for loss of axial hydraulic balance during partial-flow operation is examined from a theoretical perspective, based on a literature review, and by measurement of the axial displacement of the shaft. Structural vibration is measured using accelerometers mounted at the non-drive end bearing housing in the horizontal and axial orientations. Changes in signal contribution and characteristics are examined using a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. Test signals are used to assess the limitations of the techniques and the effect of parameter selection on the interpretation of the signals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centrifugal pumps -- Vibration</field><field name="subject">Double suction pumps</field><field name="subject">Vibration</field><field name="subject">Partial flow</field><field name="subject">Short-time Fourier</field><field name="subject">Transform</field><field name="subject">Wavelets</field><field name="subject">Axial displacement</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic excitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring conceptual geodynamic models : numerical method and application to tectonics and fluid flow</field><field name="creator">Wijns, Christopher P.</field><field name="description">Geodynamic modelling, via computer simulations, offers an easily controllable method for investigating the behaviour of an Earth system and providing feedback to conceptual models of geological evolution. However, most available computer codes have been developed for engineering or hydrological applications, where strains are small and post-failure deformation is not studied. Such codes cannot simultaneously model large deformation and porous fluid flow. To remedy this situation in the face of tectonic modelling, a numerical approach was developed to incorporate porous fluid flow into an existing high-deformation code called Ellipsis. The resulting software, with these twin capabilities, simulates the evolution of highly deformed tectonic regimes where fluid flow is important, such as in mineral provinces. A realistic description of deformation depends on the accurate characterisation of material properties and the laws governing material behaviour. Aside from the development of appropriate physics, it can be a difficult task to find a set of model parameters, including material properties and initial geometries, that can reproduce some conceptual target. In this context, an interactive system for the rapid exploration of model parameter space, and for the evaluation of all model results, replaces the traditional but time-consuming approach of finding a result via trial and error. The visualisation of all solutions in such a search of parameter space, through simple graphical tools, adds a new degree of understanding to the effects of variations in the parameters, the importance of each parameter in controlling a solution, and the degree of coverage of the parameter space. Two final applications of the software code and interactive parameter search illustrate the power of numerical modelling within the feedback loop to field observations. In the first example, vertical rheological contrasts between the upper and lower crust, most easily related to thermal profiles and mineralogy, exert a greater control over the mode of crustal extension than any other parameters. A weak lower crust promotes large fault spacing with high displacements, often overriding initial close fault spacing, to lead eventually to metamorphic core complex formation. In the second case, specifically tied to the history of compressional orogenies in northern Nevada, exploration of model parameters shows that the natural reactivation of early normal faults in the Proterozoic basement, regardless of basement topography or rheological contrasts, would explain the subsequent elevation and gravitationally-induced thrusting of sedimentary layers over the Carlin gold trend, providing pathways and ponding sites for mineral-bearing fluids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geodynamics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Geophysics -- Fluid models</field><field name="subject">Numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">Tectonics</field><field name="subject">Crustal fluid flow</field><field name="subject">Interactive evolutionary computation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acoustical wave propagator technique for structural dynamics</field><field name="creator">Peng, Shuzhi</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  This thesis presents three different methods to investigate flexural wave propagation and scattering, power flow and transmission efficiencies, and dynamic stress concentration and fatigue failures in structural dynamics. The first method is based on the acoustical wave propagator (AWP) technique, which is the main part described in this thesis. Through the numerical implementation of the AWP, the complete information of the vibrating structure can be obtained including displacement, velocity, acceleration, bending moments, strain and stresses. The AWP technique has been applied to systems consisting of a one-dimensional stepped beam, a two-dimensional thin plate, a thin plate with a sharp change of section, a heterogeneous plate with multiple cylindrical patches, and a Mindlin?s plate with a reinforced rib. For this Mindlin?s plate structure, through the comparison of the results obtained by Mindlin?s thick plate theory and Kirchhoff?s classical thin plate theory, the difference of theoretical predicted results is investigated. As part of these investigations, reflection and transmission coefficients, power flow and transmission efficiencies in a onedimensional stepped beam, and power flow in a two-dimensional circular plate structure, are studied. In particular, this technique has been successfully extended to investigate wave propagation and scattering, and dynamic stress concentration at discontinuities. Potential applications are fatigue failure prediction and damage detection in complex structures. The second method is based on experimental techniques to investigate the structural response under impact loads, which consist of the waveform measuring technique in the time domain by using the WAVEVIEW software, and steady-state measurements by using the Polytec Laser Scanning Vibrometer (PLSV) in the frequency domain. The waveform measuring technique is introduced to obtain the waveform at different locations in the time domain. These experimental results can be used to verify the validity of predicted results obtained by the AWP technique. Furthermore, distributions of dynamic strain and stress in both near-field (close to discontinuities) and far-field regions are investigated for the study of the effects of the discontinuities on reflection and transmission coefficients in a one-dimensional stepped beam structure. Experimental results in the time domain can be easily transferred into those in the frequency domain by the fast Fourier transformation, and compared with those obtained by other researchers. This PLSV technique provides an accurate and efficient tool to investigate mode shape and power flow in some coupled structures, such as a ribbed plate. Through the finite differencing technique, autospectral and spatial of dynamic strain can be obtained. The third method considered uses the travelling wave solution method to solve reflection and transmission coefficients in a one-dimensional stepped beam structure in the time domain. In particular, analytical exact solutions of reflection and transmission coefficients under the given initial-value problem are derived. These analytical solutions together with experimental results can be used to compare with those obtained by the AWP technique.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustical engineering</field><field name="subject">Sound waves -- Scattering</field><field name="subject">Structural dynamics</field><field name="subject">Acoustical wave propagator</field><field name="subject">Dynamic stress concentration</field><field name="subject">Chebyshev polynomial and fast Fourier transformation</field><field name="subject">Structural discontinuities</field><field name="subject">Power flow</field><field name="subject">Time perception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living with asthma in Australia : an anthropological perspective on life with a chronic illness</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Mary Denise</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  In Australia, asthma is a common chronic illness, which often requires complex treatment regimens. This study used an anthropological perspective to explore the experience of people living with asthma, with the specific aim of contributing to the health care programs offered to people living with asthma. The study was conducted in an Australian city (Perth, Western Australia). The foci of the study were Australian lay people, from the general community, living with asthma, and a small number of non- English speaking Vietnamese-Australian migrants. Some spouses of the Australians and biomedical practitioners were also included. Questionnaires, and particularly indepth interviews, were used to explore the explanatory models of asthma for doctors and lay people with the condition. The explanatory models of the doctors focused primarily on assessing and treating the physiological dimension of asthma, and educating patients. The explanatory models for lay people with asthma reflected their everyday reality: in addition to its impact on their physical health, asthma affected their daily life, social roles and participation, and their personal identity. Placing the experience of asthma in this wider perspective showed that the Australians used practical reasoning to make a trade-off between using medication, such that they felt safe from `attacks? and could `do all they wanted to do?, and minimising their `dependence? on potentially harmful medications. Responding to acute episodes involved a risk assessment in which people weighing the health risk of waiting against the social risk of seeking help unnecessarily. For the Vietnamese- Australians, caring for asthma was strongly shaped by their social position as non- English speaking migrants. They lacked access to information about asthma and to specialist care. They had sufficient medication, but were ill-informed about how to use their medicines effectively and safely: in general, the Vietnamese people were overmedicated but under-serviced in the care of their asthma. Beyond explanatory models, the Australian participants (lay people and doctors) shared a cultural model of asthma as a chronic illness. This Australian cultural model shaped the experience and care of asthma. It included concepts such as framing the past as an adjustment process, and the present as `living normally? with asthma. Taking care of asthma was expressed as `taking control? of asthma, so a person could minimise the illness and still be healthy. The Vietnamese-Australians did not share this cultural model of asthma as a chronic illness, as reflected in their expression of the hardship asthma created in limiting their ability to work hard for their family, and how they expected a cure for their condition from biomedicine. The Australians also shared a cultural model of health that was derived, in part, from the health promotion messages that are targeted at lay people. These promotional messages were the basis of a morality in health: people shared an implicit understanding that a person deserved health, and assistance when ill, when he/she displayed the required self-discipline in performing health behaviours.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical anthropology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Social aspects -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Asthma as chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Explanatory models</field><field name="subject">Cultural models</field><field name="subject">Australians and Vietnamese migrants</field><field name="subject">Health care programs</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement, classification and conceptualisation of atypical handedness in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Dragovic, Milan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Atypical handedness is found to be more prevalent in schizophrenia patients than in psychiatric and normal controls, suggesting atypical brain lateralisation, particularly of regions associated with language. This &#8216;behavioural aberration&#8217; is commonly considered as a marker of disturbed neurodevelopment, which is usually indexed by minor physical abnormalities. A prevailing view in the literature is that the atypical lateralisation of hand preference provides an additional index for the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. Consistent with this hypothesis, an atypical lateralisation of hand preferences can also be considered as a consequence of environmental agents that might have interfered with early embryonic development. Notwithstanding the above, an atypical lateralisation of hand preferences can occur as a result of genetic factors as well as an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The overall objective of this thesis was to advance existing knowledge on atypical laterality in schizophrenia by addressing its various (though related) aspects, including measurement, classification and conceptualisation. Atypical lateralisation of hand preferences in schizophrenia patients was approached by five separate studies.   ... Overall, this thesis argues that the causes of atypical lateralisation of hand preferences are due to combined genetic and environmental factors and that its use as a marker of vulnerability to schizophrenia is limited. A cautious interpretation of various associations between the laterality and other measures, particularly cognitive measures, is advised until a broad agreement on the true nature of handedness is reached.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Left- and right-handedness</field><field name="subject">Laterality</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia -- Physiological  aspects</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Pathological -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Handedness</field><field name="subject">Left-handedness</field><field name="subject">Schizotypy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">University selection in Singapore : a case study of students' past and intended decision-making</field><field name="creator">Rivers, Gary James</field><field name="description">This research focussed Singaporean student decision-making when choosing an institution for university studies. It is contended that if a university does not understand the dimensions of how prospective students make decisions when choosing an institution it cannot meaningfully offer representation to these potential customers. Fittingly, this thesis drew on past research from buyer behaviour and college choice studies. Adapting an established model of consumer decision-making (Engel, Blackwell and Miniard, 1990), the study investigated the degree of compliance with the Extended Problem Solving concept (Howard, 1963), including what factors determined and influenced choices, and whether students learn from past decisions. To this end, an exploratory / descriptive study used mixed methods (Creswell, 1994) to map out the dimensions of student decision-making within an Australian University and Singaporean Association case. Results indicated students? decision-making was closely aligned to simple models and their decision-making steps could be best described as (1) having a need, (2) searching and gathering information, (3) evaluating alternatives, (4) making choice/s, and (5) accepting an offer and enrolling in a university program. Further, respondents did not necessarily engage in extensive searching and gathering activities, as theorised, demonstrated limited learning and had few discernible influences on their choices. The implications for the University-Association case included the need to guide students through their decision-making processes by providing relevant data on which they could make informed choices, relative to career and income advancement. For those indicating that they would choose an institution for postgraduate studies, ensure undergraduate post-choice regret is minimised and offer more choices of management programs so that respondents would consider continuing their studies with the same institution. The study contended that, despite delimits and limitations, contributions to both theory and practise had been made and concluded with several ideas for future research, including proposing two alternative hypotheses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Students, Foreign -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Australia -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Australia -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">College choice -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">College choice -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Singaporean students -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discourses associated with the frontline management initiative and their relationship to managing practice</field><field name="creator">Barratt-Pugh, Landis G. B.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis is an analysis of a technology that is radically changing the location, process and position of manager learning, leveraging organisational learning agendas, and creating networks re-ordering institutional frameworks. The thesis examines the discourses, performances and productions associated with the Frontline Management Initiative (FMI) and provides a model of workplace-based management development. Academically, it provides new knowledge about the discourses constituting, enacting and producing manager development. Practically, it provides an understanding of the relations between workplace learning and outcomes that can inform practice. The FMI is a critical technology in terms of leveraging enterprise growth, due to its extensive national profile within the politically dominant societal structures of organisations, the critical interpreting role of frontline managers, and the innovative workplace-based, learner-centred framework. As the solitary Karpin (1995) report beacon, the FMI is positioned in highly contested terrain. Managing practice confronts the complexity of ordering knowledge work, where meaning and knowledge are more fluid and transient. Management development practice is more workplace located where knowing is more situated, distributed and relationally negotiated, but framed by politically endorsed competency-based frameworks. This study takes the unique opportunity to examine a learning technology that is being shaped by powerful mediating discourses. It examines how these multiple discourses construct FMI practice, what meanings of managing they develop and what effect these relational experiences have on subsequent managing practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Executives -- Training of -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Supervisors -- Training of -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Supervision of employees -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Management -- Study and teaching -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Management development</field><field name="subject">Frontline management</field><field name="subject">Workplace learning</field><field name="subject">Organisational development</field><field name="subject">Local agency</field><field name="subject">Extending identity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving enhanced surveillance of notifiable enteric illnesses</field><field name="creator">Leighton, Kim</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Gastroenteritis is frequently associated with a food or water borne source and the investigation of such cases is undertaken to identify potential sources of infection. Where contaminated food or water are identified as the source of infection/intoxication, action may be taken to limit or prevent further people being affected, and in so doing limit costs to the health care system. This study was undertaken to determine if there is a more effective and efficient way to collect information from patients with certain enteric illnesses. This was based on a trial process of posting self-administered questionnaires with a reply-paid return envelope to the patient and compared with the existing process where local government Environmental Health Officers interview the patient and provide a report to the Department of Health. A limiting factor in the existing process is the time lapse between the onset of illness and follow-up by Environmental Health Officers (EHOs), which results in difficulties in contacting the patient and obtaining a dietary history. Furthermore, the existing system is resource intense, requiring officers to individually interview patients either in person or by telephone. The study was of those patients living in the Perth metropolitan area whose doctor notified the Department of Health that the patient had contracted any of three notifiable enteric illnesses (campylobacterosis, giardiasis or salmonellosis), and the patient was not part of a known outbreak and was assessed as not requiring urgent follow-up. The trial process was used for patients living in five local government areas and the return rate, timeliness of return and completeness of questionnaires in the trial process was compared with the reports returned under the existing process of investigation and reporting by EHOs from 24 metropolitan local government areas that were not part of the trial process. An estimate of the potential costs to local government and the Department of Health was undertaken for both the existing and trial processes of collecting information from patients. A survey of local government EHOs in the metropolitan area was also undertaken to assess the perception of EHOs about roles and responsibilities in the follow-up investigation, the use of the Enteric Disease Investigation Report (EDIR) and the limitations that they identified in the current investigation process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastroenteritis -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Gastroenteritis -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Public health surveillance -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Enteric illness</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secondary school students engagement in educational change : critical perspectives on policy enactment</field><field name="creator">Oerlemans-Buma, Ingeborg Karin</field><field name="description">Michael Fullan (1991) commented that little was known about how students viewed educational change, as no one had thought to ask them. By 2004 there was a small but growing literature seeking the views of students on a range of issues associated with schooling. This thesis presents the findings and analysis of a study of students&#8217; perceptions of educational change. Much educational change involves shifts in power and responsibilities between the different actors, such as governments, school administrators, teachers, parents, the community and students. Despite widespread interest in educational change it is usually the macro-level policy elite who exert the most influence, using their power, privilege and status in order to propagate particular versions of schooling; students continue to be the &#8216;objects&#8217; of policy initiatives, submerged in what Freire referred to as a &#8216;culture of silence&#8217;. Students are frequently excluded as participants in both the process and decision making phases of change. This research was based on exploring the exclusion of students from the processes of change in schools, resulting from a top-down policy initiative by the State department of education in WA, the Local Area Education Planning (LAEP) Framework. How policy is defined and acted on is explored, and the roles students could have, but often do not, are highlighted. An eclectic hybrid conceptual framework drawing on both critical theory and a postmodern policy cycle approach was used to analyse the LAEP Framework policy processes and students&#8217; perceptions of the changes that ensued. The research comprised in-depth case studies of three schools undergoing substantial educational restructuring as the result of the macro-level LAEP Framework policy in the State of WA. Key elements of the policy were school amalgamations, closures and the creation of Middle Schools. Data collection methods included focus group and semi-structured interviews with students from the three schools, as well as document analysis, staff interviews and field notes. The research found that students were very perceptive about educational change, that they were deeply impacted by educational change and that they wanted to participate in restructuring agendas. Several meta-level themes emerged from the students&#8217; &#8216;voices&#8217;, including issues associated with disempowerment, and competing social justice and economic discourses. The findings foreground the often messy and contradictory tensions evident in policy processes.

Today more than 76% of children with ALL are alive and disease free at 5 years. Approximately one in 900 individuals between the ages of 16 and 44 years is a survivor of childhood cancer. In contrast, those patients who relapse with childhood ALL currently have a 6-year event free survival of 20-30%. The short arm of chromosome 9p is mutated or deleted in many cancers including leukaemia. Aberrations of the INK4A/ARF and INK4B loci at the 9p21 band are linked to the development and progression of cancer. In murine cancer models there is evidence to suggest that mutations of Ink4a/Arf and p53 gene loci promote resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs known to trigger apoptosis. The initial aim of this project was to develop an accurate, reproducible method to detect deletions at the INK4A/ARF locus in patient bone marrow specimens. This technique was then applied to detect the incidence of deletions of this locus in childhood ALL specimens. The hypothesis developed was that deletion at the INK4A/ARF locus at diagnosis in childhood ALL is an independent prognostic marker and is involved in disease progression. A secondary aim of this study was to determine which deletions at the INK4A/ARF and INK4B loci are the most relevant in leukaemogenesis in childhood ALL. ...   This study has shown that deletion of the INK4A/ARF locus is an independent prognostic indicator in childhood ALL. In addition, the frequency of deletion at the INK4A/ARF and INK4B loci is increased at relapse compared to diagnosis in childhood ALL. In the relapse study group, deletion of the p16INK4A gene at diagnosis was associated with a decreased median time to relapse compared to other genes analysed. Murine studies suggest that such deletions may result in an increased resistance to chemotherapy. If the findings from this study are confirmed in a larger cohort, it is expected that therapeutic interventions based on assessment of the p16INK4A gene in diagnostic childhood ALL specimens will be implemented to prevent relapse in standard risk patients and help to improve the outcome in high risk patients.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Polymerase chain reaction</field><field name="subject">Leukemia, childhood</field><field name="subject">Relapse</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation and maintenance of headland associated linear sandbanks</field><field name="creator">Berthot, Alexis</field><field name="description">Linear sandbanks are located globally in areas where there are strong currents and an abundance of sand. In recent years, these sandbanks have become a strategic interest as a potential source of marine aggregates (sand and gravel) and mineral deposits. They also commonly reach the sea surface and thus pose a threat to navigation. Headland-associated linear sandbanks are a specific type of sandbank, which are located in the lee of coastal topographic features such as headlands and islands. Interaction between tidal currents and topographic features generate complex three-dimensional circulation patterns that significantly influence the distribution of sediments in the vicinity of the feature. Field and numerical model investigations of the three-dimensional flow structure have been undertaken on the Levillain Shoal, a headland-associated linear sandbank present in the lee of Cape Levillain (Shark Bay, Western Australia). The field data indicated the presence of secondary flows near the tip of the Cape and around the bank, which were reproduced in the numerical simulations. Sediment transport paths near the Cape and the bank indicate that the sandbank is part of a sand circulation cell where the sand is circulating around the bank with exchanges between the sandbank and the headland. A morphological model (MTM) has been developed to understand processes responsible for the formation of the headland associated linear sandbanks. With an &#8220;idealized&#8221; Gaussian shaped headland, the formation of two symmetrical sandbanks on each side of the headland is observed. It is shown that sandbanks are formed in regions where there is a net accumulation of sand over a tidal cycle, due to the acceleration/&#8260;deceleration effects of the flow in the presence of the headland. Initially, sandbanks develop in a circular shape and grow vertically. As the sandbanks interact with the tidal flow, they evolve into elongated linear deposits (as observed in nature). The sandbank growth is dependent on the tidal regime, secondary flow, sand availability, and sediment grain size</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banks (Oceanography)</field><field name="subject">Marine sediments</field><field name="subject">Capes (Coasts)</field><field name="subject">Sandbank formation</field><field name="subject">Morphological modelling</field><field name="subject">Secondary flows</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of soft soils for deep water developments</field><field name="creator">Chung, Shin Fun</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  This research has studied the penetration and extraction resistance profiles of different types of penetrometers in soft clay. The penetrometers of interest include the cone, T&#8211;bar, ball and plate. Effects of the surface roughness and aspect ratio of the T&#8211;bar penetrometer on its resistance have also been investigated. Undrained shear strength, Su, profiles derived from the penetration tests are compared with the shear strengths measured from field vane shear tests and laboratory (triaxial and simple shear) tests. Both in situ and centrifuge model penetration tests were undertaken for the research. In addition, &#8216;undisturbed&#8217;? tube samples were retrieved from both the field and the centrifuge strongbox samples (after completion of the centrifuge tests) for laboratory testing. The in situ testing was carried out in Western Australia, at the Burswood site near Perth, with tests including cone, T&#8211;bar, ball and plate penetrometer tests, and vane shear tests. Interestingly, the T&#8211;bar, ball and plate (&#8216;full-flow&#8217;) penetrometers showed a narrow band of resistance profiles both during penetration and extraction, with a range of around 15 % between the highest and lowest profiles and standard deviation of 15 %. However, the cone penetrometer gave similar resistance at shallow depths but increasingly higher penetration resistance at depths greater than 7 m &#8211; a phenomenon that is also common in offshore results. During extraction, the cone penetrometer gave a higher resistance profile than the full&#8211;flow penetrometers for much of the depth of interest. The Su profile measured directly from the vane shear tests falls within the Su profiles derived from the penetration resistances of the full&#8211;flow penetrometers, using a single bearing factor, N = 10.5 (the value originally suggested in the literature for a T&#8211;bar penetration test). Again, the cone penetrometer demonstrated diverging results, requiring two separate values for the cone factor, Nkt (10.5 initially increasing to 13 for depths below 10 m) in order to give Su similar to the vane shear tests. This highlights the possible variability of the cone factor with depth. Cyclic penetration and extraction tests were performed at specific depths for each fullflow penetrometer. These tests comprised displacement cycles of &#177;0.5 m about the relevant depth, recording the penetration and extraction resistances over five full cycles. The results may be used to derive the remoulded strength and sensitivity of the soil. Laboratory tests such as triaxial and simple shear tests were performed on &#8216;undisturbed&#8217; tube samples retrieved from the same site to evaluate the in situ shear strengths in the laboratory. However, the resulting Su data were rather scattered, much of which may be attributed to variable sample quality due to the presence of frequent shell fragments and occasional silt lenses within the test samples. In general, N factors for the full&#8211;low penetrometers, back&#8211;calculated using Su values measured from the simple shear tests, fell mainly in a range between 9.7 and 12.8 (between 10.4 and 12.2 for the standard size T&#8211;bar (250 mm x 40 mm))</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil penetration test</field><field name="subject">Clay soils -- Western Australia -- Burswood -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Clay soils -- Western Australia -- Burswood -- Penetration resistance</field><field name="subject">Full-flow penetrometer</field><field name="subject">Plate penetrometer</field><field name="subject">T-bar penetrometer</field><field name="subject">Ball penetrometer</field><field name="subject">Undrained shear strength</field><field name="subject">Tip resistance</field><field name="subject">Cyclic test</field><field name="subject">In-situ penetration test</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A translation and historical commentary on book one and book two of the Historia of Georgi?s Pachymer?s</field><field name="creator">Cassidy, Nathan John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  My focus has been twofold.

On the other hand I have made a critical comparison between Pachymer&#275;s and the other important sources for the period, Greek, Western, and Eastern, to provide explanations for differences in the various narratives, to suggest which source is the more accurate for any given event, and to fill up the narrative &#8216;gaps&#8217; of Gomme ....

Attempts to establish aquaculture programs have been of limited success. Little is known about their visual capabilities in detail. The visual systems of fishes are known to have evolved specific adaptations that can be related to the colour of water in which they live and specific visual tasks such as predator detection and acquisition of food.

Some juveniles were also investigated. Accordingly, we developed an understanding of the features that are common to all syngnathids and those that have evolved for specific environments. Cryosections of the eyes were taken to determine morphological distinctions of this group. Lens characteristics measured using a spectrophotometer determined 50% cut-off wavelengths below 408nm for all 3 species, hence no transmission of UV light to the retina. Histological examination determined a cone dominated fovea in the ventro-temporal retina and very large rods concentrated in the peripheral retina and adjacent to the optic nerve. Microspectrophotometry measured the absorption characteristics of the visual pigments within the photoreceptors showing the presence and maximum sensitivity (&#955;max) of rods, SWS single cones, and a broad, complex array of LWS double/twin cones. The results are discussed in relation to the light environment inhabited by each species and their feeding requirements. The implications for the design of suitable light environments for aquarium and aquaculture programs for the Syngnathidae are also discussed. Rearing success of this family of fish, for both the aquarium trade and re-stocking programs, would be advised to take lighting regimes and specifics of the animals&#8217; vision into account</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sea horses -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Pipefishes -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Visual pigments</field><field name="subject">Photoreceptors</field><field name="subject">Syngnathidae</field><field name="subject">Visual system</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture</field><field name="subject">Microspectrophotometry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depositional history and mineralisation of tertiary channel iron deposits at Yandi, Eastern Pilbara, Australia</field><field name="creator">Stone, Michelle Susanne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Detailed sedimentological, petrographical, geochemical and palynological studies have provided insight into the source rocks and the processes that operated during formation of the Tertiary Yandi channel iron deposit (CID) of the eastern Pilbara, Western Australia. Yandi is the largest and most valuable CID in the world, accounting for more than 2.5% of global iron production in 2003, and is the type-example of CID. The Yandi CID occupies the palaeo-Marillana Creek in the central Hamersley Ranges. It is near-coincident-with the modern Marillana Creek which incised Proterozoic bedrock of the Weeli Wolli Formation (Hamersley Group) and associated dolerite intrusions. Three lithostratigraphic units fill the palaeo-Marillana Creek and comprise the Marillana Formation. The units in stratigraphic order are the: (1) Munjina Member; (2) Barimunya Member, which hosts the majority of the iron resource; and (3) Iowa Eastern Member. Fossil pollen and spores in organic-rich claystones in the Munjina Member indicate that deposition of the Marillana Formation most likely commenced in the Early Oligocene in response to erratic seasonal flows with high energy flood events and intervening quiescent suspension settling of clays. The Marillana Formation consists of twelve facies. These conglomerate and clay facies form three facies associations. The basal facies association is composed of polymictic conglomerate, clay and interbedded CID that represents a lag deposit along the base of the palaeochannel. This facies association characterises the Munjina Member. The second facies association consists of iron-rich conglomerate sheets, bars and subordinate scour-fills and characterises the Barimunya Member. Channel iron deposits of the overlying Iowa Eastern member consist of reworked Barimunya Member iron conglomerates. The upper facies association is polymictic conglomerate with clay that characterises the remainder of the Iowa Eastern Member. Polymictic iron conglomerate in the Munjina and Barimunya Members contains Weeli Wolli Formation and dolerite clasts indicating local derivation. Rare earth element profiles of the other iron conglomerate facies indicate derivation of the Barimunya and Iowa Eastern CID from a different source. These iron conglomerates are characterised by relatively flat LREE profiles. The LREE exhibit an enriched profile approaching the MREE [(average La/Nd)N = 0.7], and the HREE profile shows minor enrichment approaching ytterbium [(average Dy/Yb)N = 0.9]. Comparison of iron conglomerate REE profiles to those of the bedrock indicates that these conglomerates were most probably derived from the Joffre Formation BIF of the Hamersley Group</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iron ores -- Geology -- Western Australia -- Pilbara -- Yandi</field><field name="subject">Sediments (Geology) -- Western Australia -- Pilbara -- Yandi</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Tertiary</field><field name="subject">Channel iron deposit</field><field name="subject">Marillana formation</field><field name="subject">Fluvial channels</field><field name="subject">Pilbara</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for the economic analysis of road projects in an urban network with interrelated incremental traffic assignment method</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Evan Robert</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  In an urban network, any change to the capacity of a road or an intersection will generally result in some traffic changing its route. In addition the presence of intersections creates the need for frequent stops. These stops increase the fuel consumption by anywhere between thirty to fifty percent as evidenced by published standardised vehicle fuel consumption figures for urban and for country driving. Other components of vehicle operating costs such as tyre and brake wear and time costs will also be increased by varying amounts. Yet almost all methods in use for economic evaluation of urban road projects use open road vehicle operating costs (sometimes factored to represent an average allowance for stopping at intersections) for one year or sometimes two years in the analysis period and then make assumptions about how the year by year road user benefits may change throughout the period in order to complete the analysis. This thesis will describe a system for estimating road user costs in an urban network that calculates intersection effects separately and then adds these effects to the travel costs of moving between intersections. Daily traffic estimates are used with a distribution of the flow rate throughout the twenty-four hours giving variable speed of travel according to the level of congestion at different times of the day. For each link, estimates of traffic flow at two points in time are used to estimate the year-by-year traffic flow throughout the analysis period by linear interpolation or extrapolation. The annual road user costs are then calculated from these estimates. Annual road user benefits are obtained by subtracting the annual road user costs for a modified network from the annual road user costs for an unmodified network. The change in the road network maintenance costs are estimated by applying an annual per lane maintenance cost to the change in lane-kilometres of road in the two networks. The Benefit Cost Ratio is calculated for three discount rates.

Theories from, and clinical findings in, neuroscience, pharmacology, psychology and psychoneuroimmunology are integrated with extended participant observation field study involving basic shamanic training to demonstrate how Piaroa shamans learn to understand and effect biopsychosocial adaptation and promote health. It is argued that Piaroa shamanism is a sophisticated means of interpreting ecological forces and emotional processes in the interests of minimising stress across related systems: self, society, ecosystem, and cosmos. Piaroa shamans should be cadres in the promotion of an ethos, the good life of tranquillity, which serves as the basis for low-stress social relations. Piaroa mythology is predicated upon human-animal-god reciprocity and provides the shaman with a series of informationprocessing templates, designed to be invoked with the use of hallucinogens, which assist him to understand inter-systemic relations. I analyse how Piaroa shamans develop the psychic skills to divine and regulate ecological relationships and emotional processes, while highlighting possible relationships among native symbolism, neurology, consciousness and the emotions. It is argued that Piaroa shamanic practices involve conditioning the mind to achieve optimal perceptive capacities that, in association with sensitive biopsychosocial study, facilitate accurate prediction and successful psychosocial prescription.

In opposition to this view, a reading of Roth&#8217;s novels is put forward in which his desire to make sense of post-Habsburg Central Europe provides the underlying logic, thus reconciling his early novels with Radetzkymarsch and Die Kapuzinergruft. The first chapter addresses the common contention that the transformation in Roth&#8217;s work is the result of a deep identity crisis. An alternative reading of the relevance of Roth&#8217;s identity to his work is offered: namely, that Roth&#8217;s conviction that identity is multivalent explains his rejection of both nationalism and other &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the problems of post-war Europe, a sentiment that finds expression in his early novels. The interpretation of these novels, which represent Roth&#8217;s early attempts to give literary form to contemporary reality, is the focus of the second chapter of the thesis. In the third chapter Radetzkymarsch is analyzed as a historical novel in the terms first proposed by Georg Luk&#225;cs, as a novel which facilitates the understanding of the present through the portrayal of the past. Paradoxically, it is the historical form that most effectively captures and illuminates the complex reality of Roth&#8217;s contemporary times. The fourth and final chapter demonstrates that Die Kapuzinergruft is not simply an inferior sequel to Radetzkymarsch, a nostalgic evocation of an idealized lost Habsburg world and condemnation of the 1930s present, but rather continues the dialogue between past and present begun in Radetzkymarsch. In this novel, written before and in the immediate aftermath of the Anschlu&#223; of Austria to Nazi Germany, it is not Roth but his narrator who takes flight from reality, behaviour that Roth condemns as leading to the repetition of mistakes from the past and the failure to prevent the ultimate political catastrophe.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roth, Joseph, -- 1894-1939 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Roth, Joseph, -- 1894-1939.</field><field name="subject">Roth, Joseph, -- 1894-1939.</field><field name="subject">Roth, Joseph, -- 1894-1939 -- Political and social views</field><field name="subject">German fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Habsburg Empire</field><field name="subject">Jews/Jewish identity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the causal contribution of interpretive bias to anxiety vulnerability</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Edward</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  It has frequently been reported that individuals with elevated anxiety vulnerability impose threat-congruent interpretations upon emotionally ambiguous stimuli. A common hypothesis is that such threat-congruent interpretations contribute causally to the intensity and frequency of the anxiety elevations experienced by vulnerable individuals. However, no direct evidence has been provided to support this hypothesis. Empirically evaluating this theoretical position was the goal of the series of empirical studies described in this thesis. The approach employed here involved first, systematically and specifically manipulating interpretive bias, and second, assessing the consequences of such manipulations for anxiety vulnerability as assessed by individual differences in the intensity of emotional reaction to a subsequent stressor. This research was conducted in two phases. The studies in Phase 1 were designed to permit the development of training tasks, capable of inducing group differences in interpretive bias. The employed approach to such interpretive training involved the modification of priming tasks previously used to assess interpretive bias. In each trial of such priming tasks, homograph primes with both threatening and non-threatening meanings are first presented, followed by targets which, on different trials, are related to their threatening or to their non-threatening meanings. Participants are required to respond to identify each target, using the prime as a cue. In order to create interpretive training tasks capable of manipulating interpretive bias, contingencies were introduced into such priming task methodologies, such that the targets were related to differentially valenced prime meanings for different groups of participants. For the threat training group, the targets presented during training were always related to the threatening meanings of the 2 homograph primes, making it advantageous for these participants to interpret the primes in a threat-congruent fashion, with the intention of inducing a threat-congruent interpretive bias. For the non-threat training group, the targets in training were always related to the non-threatening meanings of the ambiguous primes, making it advantageous to interpret the primes in a non-threat-congruent fashion, with the intention of thus encouraging a non-threat-congruent interpretive bias. The success of these training procedures in modifying interpretive bias was then assessed in subsequent, non-contingent versions of these priming procedures</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Threat (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Interpretation of ambiguity</field><field name="subject">Emotional vulnerability</field><field name="subject">Cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical coherence tomography : technology enhancements and novel applications</field><field name="creator">Silva, K.K.M. Buddhika Dilusha</field><field name="description">In the last fifteen years, a great deal of effort has been put forth, worldwide, for investigating and enhancing various aspects of optical coherence tomography (OCT).  This thesis begins with a description of the technique of OCT, and an analysis of its underlying theory.  The design and construction of an OCT system is described, with particular emphasis on a novel delay scanning method, and novel signal processing.  Application of OCT to non-destructive characterisation of seeds, examination of skin lesions, measurement of fluid flow, and refractive index determination, are then demonstrated.  Two technological enhancements to OCT are presented in this thesis. The first, an extended-range Fourier domain optical delay line (FDODL), extends the scan range of the traditional FDODL by a factor of almost 9, by scanning the galvanometer mirror around the region of zero tilt-angle.  Polarisation optics are used to prevent light coupling back into the interferometer after only a single pass through the FDODL.  A non-coplanar version of the FDODL is also presented, which overcomes the losses associated with the polarisation-based design, but trades off scan range to do so.  Both versions of FDODL demonstrated excellent linearity and scan uniformity.  The second technology presented here, bifocal optical coherence refractometry (BOCR), affords OCT the ability to measure refractive indices within turbid media.  It achieves this by generating two confocal gates within the sample.  From knowledge of the system parameters, and measurements of the confocal gate separation, the refractive index within the medium is evaluated to within &#177;0.01.  Refractive index mapping is then demonstrated in a number of turbid samples. Three other applications of OCT are also demonstrated in this thesis.  The first is the use of OCT to measure full thickness in lupin seeds.  Although OCT could not penetrate the entire thickness of the hull, it is demonstrated that the variation in thickness of the two layers observed with OCT, explained 81% of the variation in thickness of the entire hull measured under a SEM.  OCT was then applied, for what is believed to be the first time, in a large scale seed screening program.  The second application is a preliminary investigation of the suitability of OCT to aid in the diagnosis of skin lesions.  Although our system did not possess sufficient positioning accuracy to enable a direct one-to-one comparison between OCT and histology, a number of correspondences between OCT and histology images were demonstrated.  The final application of OCT demonstrated here is a novel phase-locked-loop based demodulation scheme, to perform Doppler OCT.  This demodulation scheme demonstrated a dynamic range of 98dB, a velocity range of &#177;20mm/s, and velocity resolution of 0.5mm/s.  Using this system, laminar flow was demonstrated in milk flowing through a capillary tube.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical tomography</field><field name="subject">Coherence (Optics)</field><field name="subject">Imaging systems in medicine</field><field name="subject">Optical coherence tomography</field><field name="subject">Skin lesions</field><field name="subject">Delay lines</field><field name="subject">Skin cancer</field><field name="subject">Biomedical optics</field><field name="subject">Medical imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tidal and sediment dynamics of a partially mixed, micro-tidal estuary</field><field name="creator">O'Callaghan, Joanne M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The expansion of human populations in coastal land margins has resulted in major modifcations to estuarine ecosystems. The use of numerical models as predictive tools for assessing remediation strategies is increasing. However, parameterisation of physical processes, developed mainly through field investigations, is necessary for these models to be reliable and effective management tools. The physical processes in micro&#8211;tidal diurnal tidal systems are relatively unknown and the current study examines field measurements obtained from the upper Swan River estuary (Western Australia), a diurnal, partially mixed system during the summer when the freshwater discharge is negligible. The aims of the study were to characterise, temporally and spatially, the dominant physical processes and associated sediment resuspension. Variability at three dominant time-scales were examined: 1) sub&#8211;tidal oscillations (&#8764;5 to 10 days) resulting from local and remote forcing; 2) tidal (&#8764; 24 hours) due to astronomical forcing; and 3) intra-tidal (&#8764;2 to 3 hours) resulting from the interaction between tidal constituents. Circulation in estuaries is widely accepted in the literature to be dominated, in varying proportions, by tidal range, freshwater discharge and gravitational circulation. In the upper Swan River estuary sub&#8211;tidal oscillations were responsible for the largest upstream displacement of the salt wedge in the absence of freshwater discharge. Moreover, these sub&#8211;tidal fluctuations in water level modified the &#8216;classic&#8217; estuarine circulation. The dynamics of diurnal tides are largely controlled by the tropic month, which oscillates at a slightly different period to the lunar month, resulting in the spring&#8211;neap tidal cycle to be sometimes different from syzygy. The phase lag between the diurnal (O1 + K1) and semi-diurnal (M2 + S2) constituents, at the seasonal time scale cause the maximum tidal range to be near the solstice. Over a 24&#8211;hour tidal cycle this phase lag is manifested as an intra&#8211;tidal oscillation that occurs on the flood tide. Turbidity events that last &#8764;1 to 2 hours occur during the intra&#8211;tidal oscillation, but are not related to maximum shear stress predicted from the mean flow characteristics. The increases in turbidity during the intra&#8211;tidal oscillation is, however, correlated with the near&#8211;bed Reynolds fluxes. During the intra&#8211;tidal oscillation advection opposes the estuarine circulation in the near&#8211;bed region, promoting vertical shear that results in destratifcation of the water column. The turbulent mixing generated at the interface and in the near&#8211;bed region coincide with resuspension events. Similar turbidity data have often been disregarded and documented as being &#8216;spikes&#8217; based on the premise that the mean flow was below a critical level to resuspend sediment. Resuspension events were not simply related to mean processes and may be controlled by turbulent instabilities generated when tidal currents reverse during an intra-tidal oscillation</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuaries -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Oceanography -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Estuarine sediments -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estaury</field><field name="subject">Suspended sediments -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Tides -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Swan River Estuary (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Estuarine dynamics</field><field name="subject">Diurnal tides</field><field name="subject">Sub-tidal oscillations</field><field name="subject">Sediment resuspension</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form and reform : affective form and the garden suburb</field><field name="creator">Stickells, Lee</field><field name="description">This thesis establishes the concept of affective form as a means of examining urban design &#8211; being the intersection of architecture, planning and landscape &#8211; in relation to techniques of governance. Affective form broadly describes a built environment where people are encouraged to amend, or govern, their actions according to particular socio&#8211;political ideas. Exploration of the concept&#8217;s application as a theoretical tool is undertaken here in order to generate a means of discussing the ethical function of urban design. The emergence of notions of affective form will be located in the eighteenth century, alongside the growing confidence in the ability for humankind to effect social and cultural progress. In a series of examples, stretching throughout the twentieth century, the implicit relation of planning, architectural and landscape form to social effect is discussed. The language, and design models, used to delineate affective form are described, alongside discussion of the level of intentionality apparent in the conceptions of urban form&#8217;s social effect. Critique through affective form allows an analysis that brings together the underlying utopian elements of projects &#8211; the traces of ideology and sociological theories &#8211; with an evaluation of the formal concepts projected. As the second area of investigation, the city of Perth in Western Australia provides a contextual focus for the examination of concepts of affective form. Through a series of appropriations of urban design models a suburban archetype emerged in Perth of a planned, homogenous field of low&#8211;rise, single&#8211;family, detached dwellings within a gardenesque landscape. The process of appropriation is described as a continuing negotiation between local expectations and the implicit conceptions of affective form within the imported models. Connecting the two primary concerns of the thesis, the ability of form to influence social change and the evolution of Perth&#8217;s garden suburb ideal, is the association of that developing garden suburb model with notions of affective form. The associations are outlined through three case studies. The first is an account of the planning of the City of Perth Endowment Lands Project during the 1920s. The second describes the planning and architecture of the athlete&#8217;s village built for the VIIIth British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Perth in 1962. The third study details the development in the 1990s of Joondalup, a satellite city in the Perth metropolitan region. The account of Perth&#8217;s garden suburb ideal is intertwined with the consideration of the varying ways in which the conceptualization of affective form has been expressed. Each case study is contextualized by a preceding chapter that discusses the particular conceptions of affective form used in its examination.

C.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It is becoming increasingly obvious that cell signalling pathways are more complicated than we originally perceived. Research is revealing that, not only is there a multitude of new proteins involved in signalling cascades, but also that previously identified proteins may have additional, alternate roles in intracellular trafficking. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in conjunction with its receptor (GnRHR), the primary regulator of reproduction in all species, is no exception. In the past few years it has become readily accepted that the classic linear GnRHR-G&#945;q/11 signalling pathway is not universal and that this receptor is involved in a far greater range of cellular activities than was previously considered. In particular, it is widely accepted that continuous administration of GnRH analogs results in an inhibition of growth of a number of reproductive-derived tumours and that this may, in part, be mediated by direct activation of GnRHs expressed on these cells. However, it is not fully understood how the GnRHR mediates these growth effects or whether such effects are unique to reproductive-derived cancer cells. Research within this thesis aimed to determine how the presence or absence of this receptor in different cell types might affect the ability of GnRH to directly mediate growth effects. We demonstrate that continuous treatment with a GnRH agonist (GnRHA) induces an anti-proliferative effect in a gonadotropederived cell line (L&#946;T2) and also in HEK293 cells stably expressing either the rat or human GnRHR. The anti-proliferative effect was time- and dose-dependent and was specifically mediated via the GnRHR, as co-treatment of the GnRHRexpressing cell lines with a GnRH antagonist blocked the growth suppressive effect induced by GnRHA treatment. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the GnRHA treated HEK/GnRHR cell lines induced an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase while a G0/G1 arrest was observed in L&#946;T2 cells. Previous identification by our group of a potential interaction between the GnRHR and the transcription factor E2F4, an integral cell cycle regulatory protein, prompted further investigation as to the nature of this interaction.  Bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET) was utilised to demonstrate that the GnRHR also interacts with E2F5, another member of the E2F family of cell cycle proteins that shares a high level of homology to E2F4. In addition, it was determined that the interaction between human GnRHR and E2F4, detected using BRET, was influenced by cell density.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Luteinizing hormone releasing  hormone</field><field name="subject">Cells -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Cell proliferation</field><field name="subject">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining methods of analysis to understand the demography of corals : an example for populations of the mushroom coral Fungia fungites exposed to contrasting regimes of disturbance</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, James Paton</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]   Most ecological research investigates the demography of organisms, which can be summarised by their population dynamics and structure. Population dynamics are the rates of birth, growth, reproduction and survival of individuals, which determine the number of individuals in different stage classes, or, the population structure. Understanding the demography of organisms is particularly difficult, and requires the application of different methods of investigation. A number of methods of investigation are required because each can only investigate particular aspects of population demography, and is subject to problems of inaccuracy and bias. Thus, population demography is best understood by simultaneously collecting complimentary data using different methods of analysis to quantify how and why the dynamics and structure of populations change with their environment. The need for complimentary methods of investigation to understand population demography is even greater for organisms that have complex life histories, such as corals. The life histories of corals are particularly complex because they display a variety of modes of sexual and asexual reproduction, and their rates of growth, reproduction and survival are strongly influenced by the size of the individual, which can change rapidly. Additionally, the rates of sexual recruitment to populations of corals are notoriously variable in space and time. Thus, corals are an ideal model to investigate the usefulness of combining methods of analysis to better understand the demography of organisms. In this thesis I demonstrate that combining data from a number of methods of analysis provides a much better understanding of the demography of populations of the mushroom coral Fungia fungites that were exposed to contrasting regimes of disturbance. I used methods of analysis that produce unique and complimentary results, in the form of genetic, size-structure, life history and experimental data. Genetic data confirmed that I was correctly identifying life history stages of polyps, indicated the extent to which a stock-recruitment relationship existed between the sexual recruits and the adult polyps at each population, and provided an estimate of the relative contribution of asexual recruitment to population maintenance. Changes in the size-structures of populations were quantified to determine the effects of different regimes of disturbance, and these changes in population structure were explained by quantifying the life history traits of polyps and their rates of transition through their life cycle.

The &#8220;Silvergrasses&#8221; of the genus Vulpia are excellent examples being widely distributed, are prevalent weeds of agriculture and have had a long history to naturalise on the continent. Research was undertaken on Vulpia populations to identify if naturalising species have reproductive traits that provide propagules with the best chances of success. Furthermore, research aimed at investigating if these traits vary between species and their populations and how this variability related to the environment. A herbarium and field study was undertaken to establish what Vulpia species occur in SW Australia and to investigate environmental factors affecting their distribution. 169 herbaria specimens was examined and a botanical field survey of 189 sites was carried out in September 1998. Four species occur in the region: V. fasciculata, V. muralis, V. bromoides and two variants of V. myuros (V. myuros var. megalura and V. myuros var. myuros). V. bromoides and V. myuros were introduced early into the region while V. fasciculata and V. muralis more recently. It is plausible that Vulpia invaded the region via early seaport settlements and was spread by agricultural expansion. 96% of field sites contained V. myuros var. myuros, 79% V. myuros var. megalura, 50% V. bromoides, 6% V. fasciculata and 6% contained V. muralis. 90% of sites contained a mix of species and 9% of sites contained pure species stands. V. myuros var. myuros is the most widespread species and dominant form of V. myuros. It is found from high rainfall regions through to arid locations occurring on mostly light textured low fertility soils. V. muralis and V. fasciculata occur infrequently with the former widely dispersed and the later occurring predominantly on sands. V. bromoides occurs extensively in high rainfall regions but rarely extends to locations receiving less than 400-450mm annual rainfall and northward above 30&#176;00&#8217; latitude. It is predominantly on light to loamy textured soils that are fertile and acid. The most common species V. myuros and V. bromoides often coexist within sites but the dominance of one over the other is strongly correlated with growing season length and false break frequency. V. bromoides is positively correlated to growing season length and V. myuros is negatively related. The distribution of Vulpia species is strongly influenced by climate and soils. Variability in distribution is a reflection of the ecological differentiation between species to colonise different environments</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grasses -- Ecology -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Grasses -- Colonization -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Ecology -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Colonization -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Alien plants -- Ecology -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Alien plants -- Colonization -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Germination ecology</field><field name="subject">Colonisation</field><field name="subject">Ecotype</field><field name="subject">Vulpia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus benefits of white lupin, field pea and faba bean to wheat production in Western Australian soils</field><field name="creator">Nuruzzaman, Mohammad</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Soils of Western Australian cropping regions are very low in phosphorous.

Though other factors affect the shape of bone (e.g., genetics, hormones, blood supply), the skeleton adapts its shape mainly in response to the mechanical environment to which it is exposed throughout life. The specific relationship between the mechanical environment and the mechanical adaptation response of the skeleton is reviewed. Theories of mechanical adaptation are applied to the sites of tendon attachment to bone (entheses), the adaptation of generalised trabecular bone (i.e., Wolff&#8217;s Law of trabecular architecture), sesamoid bones that are often found where a tendon wraps around a bony pulley, and the internal trabecular structure of a whole bony sesamoid such as the patella. The relative importance of compression rather than tension in bone adaptation theories is still not fully understood. Some mechanical adaptation theories suggest that an overwhelming tensile stress at a skeletal location does not stimulate bone deposition, but would instead lead to bone resorption. The skeletal locations studied in this work were chosen because they have been proposed to be in tension. Computer simulations involving models are an ideal method to analyse the mechanical environment of a skeletal location. They are able to determine the mechanical stresses at, and the stress patterns around, complex biological situations. This study uses a two dimensional computer simulation program, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (Flac), to analyse the stress at the skeletal locations, and to test theories of mechanical adaptation over time by simulating physiological adaptation. The initial purpose of this study is to examine the stress in the skeletal tissue in generalised trabeculae, anatomical sites where a tendon wraps around a bony pulley, in the trabecular networks that fill the patella, and at tendon attachments. A secondary purpose, that follows directly from the first, is to relate the results of these initial stress analyses to existing and hypothetical skeletal tissue remodelling theories, to suggest how the complex skeletal structures might be generated solely in response to their mechanical environment. The term &#8220;remodelling&#8221; is used throughout this work to refer to mechanical adaptation of bone, usually at a surface of bone, rather than the internal regeneration of osteons (Haversion systems)</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system</field><field name="subject">Human skeleton -- Adaptation</field><field name="subject">Human skeleton -- Adaptation -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Adaptation</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Adaptation -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Mechanical properties -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Bone mechanical adaptation</field><field name="subject">Sesamoids</field><field name="subject">Patella</field><field name="subject">Entheses</field><field name="subject">Trabecular architecture</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0095</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator">Pack, David J.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The &#8216;elemental sulphur&#8217; deposition problem is a fairly recent phenomenon for gas transmission pipelines. Although known for a number of decades to cause plugging in reservoir wellhead facilities, it is since about 1990 that &#8216;elemental sulphur&#8217; deposition has openly been acknowledged as a problem in natural gas pipelines and other facilities downstream of gas processing plants. Within the past ten years this formation / deposition process has progressively been more widely observed. The increasing trend to have transmission pipeline systems operating at higher pressures is a significant contributing factor in the formation of &#8220;elemental sulphur&#8221;. This research project has been able to identify the principles and mechanisms associated with the formation and deposition &#8216;sulphur vapour map&#8217; concept, that only sub ppm levels of sulphur vapour within the gas stream is required to initiate the &#8220;elemental sulphur&#8221; formation / deposition process. The &#8216;sulphur vapour map&#8217; can be used in predicting the degree of sulphur vapour desublimation that will occur for given pipeline operating conditions of pressure, temperature and gas composition. This, in turn, will assist in the minimization of the deposition process through the ability to make simple, yet appropriate, modifications to the design of the required pipeline pressure regulation stage. A significant number of other potential contributing factors to this pipeline particle formation and deposition process have also been identified through this research work. From these findings a number of additional recommendations have been made that will assist pipeline operators in minimizing the impact of this deposition problem. These recommendations are based on the operation of the pipeline, and particularly the control of the entry of liquids and other contaminants into the pipeline system.

Members of the secretoglobin family appear to play an important role in controlling airway inflammation but they have received relatively little attention in asthma genetic research. In this thesis, I have investigated the genes of two members of the secretoglobin family (16 kDa Clara cell secretory protein (CC16) and secretoglobin 3A2 (SCGB3A2)) that are expressed at high levels in the airways and are important anti-inflammatory agents. The overall aim of these studies was to investigate the genetic variability of the CC16 and SCGB3A2 genes and their influence on airway inflammatory disease. The main hypothesis was that genetic variability in the genes for CC16 and SCGB3A2 exert an influence on airway inflammatory disease. Three populations were investigated: (1) a paediatric case control population (n=99), (2) an unselected birth cohort followed longitudinally at ages 1 month (n=244), six (n=123) and 11 years (n=195) and (3) an unselected Aboriginal Australian population (n=251). The case-control population was screened for novel DNA sequence variants in the CC16 promoter and the SCGB3A2 5&#8217;UTR and exons. No novel sequence variants were identified in the CC16 promoter and two were identified in the SCGB3A2 5&#8217;UTR (G- 811A and G-205A). A single nucleotide polymorphism previously identified in the CC16 gene (A38G) and the two polymorphisms identified in the SCGB3A2 gene were genotyped in both unselected populations. Genotype/phenotype associations were identified with adjustment for potential confounders such as age, gender, height and maternal tobacco smoking, where appropriate. This was due to the contribution of these factors to the aetiology of asthma, atopy and related phenotypes.

State-of-the-art infrared detection and imaging systems are currently based around high density focal plane arrays consisting of HgCdTe photodiodes as detector elements. Despite the high performance of HgCdTe infrared detectors, and the many benefits they can offer to industry and society, their utilisation remains limited due to the high cost of production. The chemical composition and narrow bandgap of the HgCdTe material used for infrared detection means that the material is inherently very susceptible to defect formation caused by the processing procedures required for device fabrication. Consequently, fabrication of HgCdTe photodiode arrays have traditionally been characterised by low yields and high costs for arrays that meet required operability specifications. In this thesis a new photodiode fabrication technology with the potential to improve device yields over traditional fabrication technologies is presented. This new fabrication technology is distinguished from others by the use of plasma-induced p-to-n type conversion of HgCdTe for junction formation. This allows great simplification of the fabrication process and avoids high temperature processing during and after junction formation, and keeps the junction protected from the atmosphere at all stages of fabrication. The development of the photodiode fabrication technology using plasma-induced junction formation has involved characterising the electrical transport properties of the type-converted layers, fabrication and characterisation of photodiodes, and photodiode dark current modelling</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photodiodes</field><field name="subject">Photon detectors</field><field name="subject">Infrared detectors</field><field name="subject">Infrared array detectors</field><field name="subject">Infrared</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms and clinical implications of the neuroendocrine response to a novel carbon dioxide stressor in man</field><field name="creator">Kaye, Joey Michael</field><field name="description">Maintenance of normal health requires an intact stress system capable of mounting the metabolic, autonomic, behavioural and motor responses required for coping with or avoiding physiological and pathological challenges. The neuroendocrine component of this response principally involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympatho-adrenomedullary (SAM) axes. Impaired regulation of these axes has been implicated in the pathogenesis and expression of numerous disease states, however, it has proved very difficult to reproducibly activate the HPA and SAM axes and no single test exists that can reliably and safely be used to study these systems in man. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the principal regulator of respiration, acid-base balance and behavioural-state arousal in humans. Paradigms of CO2 inhalation have been used in psychiatric research to investigate panic and anxiety disorders, but evaluation of other components of the stress response to CO2 has not previously been performed. I hypothesised that a single breath of 35% CO2 would be a simple and reliable tool for the evaluation of the stress response in humans. A single breath of four doses of CO2 (5%, 25%, 35% and 50%) was administered to 9 healthy volunteers in a randomised, single blind fashion. Subjective symptoms of anxiety increased in a dose-dependent manner. Inhalation of a single breath of 35% CO2 stimulated significant ACTH (p = 0.006), noradrenaline (p &lt; 0.0001), cortisol (p = 0.02) and prolactin (p = 0.002) release. It also provoked an acute pressor response and an associated bradycardia (p &lt; 0.0001 for both). No significant habituation of psychological, HPA or cardiovascular responses was seen when this dose was repeated after one week (n = 10) or 6 months (n = 5). It was apparent that a single breath of 35% CO2 reliably and safely produced SAM and HPA axis activation and further studies were then undertaken to assess the mechanism by which the observed responses occurred and its potential clinical implications. Administration of naltrexone (an opiate antagonist) to 10 normal volunteers disinhibited the HPA axis (p &lt; 0.0004), whilst administration of metyrapone (a cortisol synthesis inhibitor) significantly reduced baseline cortisol (p &lt; 0.03) levels. However, this alteration in HPA axis activity had no effect on either cardiovascular or psychological responses. Further, in a study of 8 breastfeeding mothers (a state associated with physiological suppression of the HPA axis) suckling significantly reduced plasma cortisol levels compared with control (p = 0.002) and bottle-feeders (p = 0.003).

We do not know if the traditional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors remain important in this group. Despite the growing body of data relating to exogenous estrogen, we know very little about the relationship of endogenous estrogen with inflammation, CHD risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis in elderly women. Genes that may play a role in post-menopausal cardiovascular disease (CVD)(ER-&#945; and Apo E gene polymorphisms) have not been examined in this population for their effect on sub-clinical atherosclerosis and whether this effect is modified by the level of endogenous estrogen.

In the work described in this thesis, this hypothesis was tested by inducing apoptotic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in neonatal and adult rats and mice, and then examining whether intravitreally grafted cells from a range of sources of donor neural tissue became incorporated into these selectively depleted retinae. Donor tissues were: a postnatal murine cerebellar-derived immortalised neural precursor cell line (C17.2); an adult rat hippocampal-derived clonal stem-like line (HCN/GFP); mouse embryonic day 14 (E14) primary dissociated retinal cells (Gt[ROSA]26); and adult mouse ciliary pigmented margin-derived primary neurospheres (Gt[ROSA]26). In neonates, rapid RGC death was induced by removal of the contralateral superior colliculus (SC), and in adults, delayed RGC death was induced by unilateral optic nerve (ON) transection. Some adult hosts received ON transection coupled with an autologous peripheral nerve (PN) graft. Donor cells were injected intravitreally 6-48 h after SC ablation (neonates) or 0, 5, 7 or 14 days after ON injury (adults). Cells were also injected into non-RGC depleted neonatal and adult retinae. At 4 or 8 weeks, transplanted cells were identified, quantified and their differentiation fate within host retinae was assessed. Transplanted male C17.2 cells were identified in host retinae using a Y-chromosome marker and in situ hybridisation, or by their expression of the lacZ reporter gene product Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) using Xgal histochemistry or a beta-gal antibody. No C17.2 cells were identified in axotomised adult-injected eyes undergoing delayed RGC apoptosis (n = 16). Donor cells were, however, stably integrated within the retina in 29% (15/55) of mice that received C17.2 cell injections 24 h after neonatal SC ablation; 6-31% of surviving cells were found in the RGC layer (GCL). These NSC-like cells were also present in intact retinae, but on average there were fewer cells in GCL. In SC-ablated mice, most grafted cells did not express retinal-specific markers, although occasional donor cells in the GCL were immunopositive for beta-III tubulin (TUJ1), a protein highly iii expressed by, but not specific to, developing RGCs. Targeted rapid RGC depletion thus increased C17.2 cell incorporation into the GCL, but grafted C17.2 cells did not appear to differentiate into an RGC phenotype.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retina -- Diseases -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Nerve tissue -- Transplantation</field><field name="subject">Cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Retina -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Ganglion cell depletion</field><field name="subject">Retinal transplantation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics, distribution and timing of gold mineralisation in the Pine Creek Orogen, Northern Territory, Australia</field><field name="creator">Sener, A. K.</field><field name="description">Over the last two decades, gold occurrences in the Palaeoproterozoic Pine Creek Orogen (PCO) have been cited as type-examples of high-temperature contact-metamorphic or thermal-aureole deposits associated with granitoid magmatism. Furthermore, spatial relationships between these gold occurrences and the granitoids have led to inclusion of these deposits in the intrusion-related gold deposit group. Research on the characteristics, distribution and timing of these gold deposits tests these classifications and supports an alternative interpretation. The deposits display many similarities to well-described &#8216;turbidite-hosted&#8217; orogenic gold deposits described from several Palaeozoic orogens. As in most &#8216;turbidite-hosted&#8217; orogenic deposits, the gold mineralisation is dominantly epigenetic, sediment-hosted (typically greywacke and siltstone) and fold-controlled. Most gold is hosted by concordant or discordant veins, with limited alteration halos in host rocks, except where they occur in silicate-facies BIF or other Fe-rich rocks. The domal culminations of major doubly-plunging anticlines, and/or fold-limb thrust-faults, are important structural controls at the camp- and deposit-scales. Many deposits are sited in parts of the lithostratigraphy where there is significant competency and/or chemical contrast between units or sequences. In particular, the complex interdigitated stratigraphy of euxinic and transitional high-energy sedimentary rocks of the c.1900-1880Ma South Alligator Group is important for the localisation of gold deposits. The distribution of deposits is influenced further by the location and shape of granitoids and their associated contact-metamorphic aureole. Approximately 90% of gold deposits lie within the &#8764;2.5km wide contact-aureole, and most of these are concentrated in, and just beyond, the biotite-albite-epidote zone (0.5-1.0km from granitoid), with few deposits located in the inner hornblende-hornfels zone. At the deposit scale, gold is commonly associated with arsenopyrite-loellengite and pyrite, native-Bi and Bi-bearing minerals, and is confined to a variety of extensional quartz-sulphide &#177; carbonate veins. Such veins formed typically at 180-320&#176;?C and &#8764;1kbar from low- to moderate salinity, two-phase aqueous fluids. Isotopic studies of the deposits are equivocal in terms of the source of hydrothermal fluid. Most &#948;D and &#948;18O values fall within the range defined for contact-metamorphic and magmatic fluids, and sulphur isotopes indicate that the fluids are within the range of most regional sources. Significantly, lead isotope ratios show that the goldbearing fluid does not have a felsic magmatic-source signature, but instead suggest a homogenous regional-scale lead source. Excluding a few outliers, the relative uniformity of deposit characteristics, including host rocks, structural style, alteration, sulphide paragenesis and fluid P-T-X conditions, suggests that most deposits represent a continuum of broadly coeval mineralisation that formed under similar geological conditions</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Northern Territory -- Pine Creek Orogen</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Metallogeny -- Northern Territory -- Pine Creek Orogen</field><field name="subject">Gold mineralisation</field><field name="subject">SHRIMP U-Pb</field><field name="subject">Pine Creek Orogen</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Duplication and polymorphism with particular reference to regulators of complement activation</field><field name="creator">McLure, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  For the convenience of the reader, detailed figures and tables have been enlarged and compiled in Appendix 2, at the end of this thesis. This thesis is presented as an approach to identify, annotate and detect genomic duplication and polymorphism within large genomic regions. To demonstrate this, I have used as a model, the genomic region known as the Regulators of Complement Activation (RCA). The RCA complex is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 at position 1q32 and is a reservoir of complement regulatory proteins. The genes of the RCA share many similarities implying that all have arisen through multiple complex duplication events. My analysis of this region in the following chapters demonstrates the complexity of this duplication and identifies the many functional units within the RCA. It was my aim at the beginning of these studies to demonstrate an approach that could define the Ancestral Haplotypes (AHs) of the RCA gene cluster. To do this, extensive genomic analysis was required and the ever-increasing availability of genomic sequence has made this thesis possible. Each of the chapters serves to address the following aims set out at the beginning of this thesis: 1. Further characterise the relationship between the genes (Complement Control proteins-CCPs) and domains of the Regulators of Complement Activation (RCA). 2. Identify and examine the duplicated elements within the RCA. - 6 - 3.

Clinically, HMSNR manifests with typical CMT symptoms, while no associated features have been detected. Distinct neuropathological features of HMSNR include the presence of numerous clusters of thinly myelinated fibres originating from regenerative activity. HMSNR has been previously mapped to chromosome 10q using a large Bulgarian Gypsy kindred. Subsequent identification of related chromosome 10q haplotypes in Spanish and Romanian Gypsy families suggested a founder mutation in the Gypsy population as the cause of HMSNR. This thesis describes the refined mapping of the HMSNR gene by generating a high-density physical-genetic map of the HMSNR region containing 20 microsatellite markers and 229 SNPs and insertion/deletions which allowed meticulous mapping of recombination breakpoints resulting in a reduction of the HMSNR gene region from 1 Mb to just 63.8 kb. Analysis of positional candidates by direct sequencing included 14 known genes, 7 predicted genes and 42 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) nonoverlapping with the genes. 78 putative HMSNR mutations were identified, two of which exhibit complete segregation with the HMSNR phenotype. Both are located in the so-called testis-specific part of unexpected candidate gene hexokinase 1 (HK1), in a rare alternative untranslated 5&#8217; exon of HK1 and in the adjacent downstream intron.

The greatest sensitivity, response speed, and wavelength range is offered by infrared detectors based on HgCdTe semiconductor material, the growth and characterisation of which is the subject of this thesis. Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is a versatile method of depositing layers of semiconductor material on a suitable crystalline substrate. In particular, MBE facilitates the growth of multilayer structures, thus allowing bandgap engineered devices to be realised. By modulating the bandgap within the device structure it is possible to improve the sensitivity or increase the operating temperature of photodetectors when compared to devices fabricated on single layer material. Furthermore, dual-band detectors may be fabricated using multi-layered HgCdTe material. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with the development of the MBE process for multilayer growth, from modelling of the growth process to characterisation of the material produced, and measurement of photoconductive devices fabricated on these wafers. In this thesis a previously published model of HgCdTe growth by MBE is reviewed in detail, and is applied to the growth of double layer heterostructures in order to determine the optimum method of changing the mole fraction between layers. The model has been used to predict the change in the temperature of the phase limit when the mole fraction and growth rate change suddenly as is the case during growth of an abrupt heterostructure. Two options for growth of an abrupt heterostructure were examined (a) modulating the CdTe flux and (b) modulating the Te flux. The change in the phase limit temperature between the layers was calculated as being 4:1&#177;C for option (a) and 5:2&#177;C for option (b) when growing a Hg(0:7)Cd(0:3)Te/Hg(0:56)Cd(0:44)Te heterostructure</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mercury cadmium tellurides</field><field name="subject">Infrared radiation -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Molecular beam epitaxy</field><field name="subject">HgCdTe</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post implant dosimetric analysis for prostate brachytherapy</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Annette</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Purpose: Permanent prostate brachytherapy (PPB) as a treatment option for prostate cancer requires implantation of 80-150 radioactive iodine-125 (I-125)</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate cancer -- Radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope brachytherapy</field><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry</field><field name="subject">Brachytherapy</field><field name="subject">Dosimetry</field><field name="subject">Radiology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new Lagrangian model for the dynamics and transport of river and shallow water flows</field><field name="creator">Devkota, Bishnu Hari</field><field name="description">This study presents a new Lagrangian model for predicting dynamics and transport in rivers and shallow water flows. A hydrostatic model is developed for the prediction of rivers and floodplain flow and lateral interactions between them. The model is extended to the Boussinesq weakly non-linear, non-hydrostatic model for the simulation of solitary waves and undular bores. A model for advection-diffusion transport of tracers in open channel flow is also presented. The simulation results are compared against an analytical solution and published laboratory data, field data and theoretical results. It is demonstrated that the Lagrangian moving grid eliminates numerical diffusion and oscillations; the model is dynamically adaptive, providing higher resolution under the wave by compressing the parcels (grid). It also allows flow over dry beds and moving boundaries to be handled efficiently. The hydrostatic model results have shown that the model accurately simulates wave propagation and non-linear steepening until wave breaking. The model is successfully applied to simulate flow and lateral interactions in a compound channel and flood wave movement in a natural river. The non-hydrostatic model has successfully reproduced the general features of solitary waves such as the balance between non-linearity and wave dispersion and non-linear interactions of two solitary waves by phase-shift. Also, the model successfully reproduced undular bores (high frequency short waves) from a long wave and the predicted maximum height of the leading wave agreed very well with the published results. It is shown that the simple second order accurate Lagrangian scheme efficiently simulates dispersive waves without any numerical diffusion. Lagrangian modeling of advection-diffusion transport of Gaussian tracer distributions, top hat tracer distributions and steep fronts (step function) in steady, uniform flow has provided exact results and has shown that the scheme allows the use of a large time step without any numerical diffusion and oscillations, including for the advection of steep fronts. The scheme can handle large Courant numbers (results are presented for Cr = 0 to 20) and the entire range of grid Peclet numbers from zero to infinity. The model is successfully applied to tracer transport due to flow induced by simple waves, solitary waves and undular bores</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lagrangian functions</field><field name="subject">Streamflow -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Langranian modelling</field><field name="subject">River flows</field><field name="subject">River-floodplain interactions</field><field name="subject">Solitary waves</field><field name="subject">Undular bores</field><field name="subject">Advection dominated transport</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the role of CD14 in human and animal liver diseases</field><field name="creator">Leicester, Katherine L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Chronic liver injury results from many etiologies ranging from viral infection to inborn errors of metabolism. A common result of liver injury is activation of hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. In chronic injury, production of extracellular matrix by activated myofibroblasts results in liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Kupffer cells and monocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain liver diseases. Endotoxin-responsive macrophages and recruited monocytes (CD14-positive cells) are potential sources of profibrogenic factors but their potential role in the pathogenesis of liver disease has not previously been examined. The first aim of this thesis described in chapter 3 was to evaluate the hypothesis that CD14-positive macrophages/monocytes are present in the livers of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and contribute to the pathogenesis of fibrosis as evidenced by co-localization of these cells with activated myofibroblasts. Liver specimens from control subjects and those with HH, PBC, HCV and NASH were immunostained for CD14, CD68 and &#945;-smooth muscle actin and the number of cells expressing these antigens was determined. The total number of hepatic CD68-positive cells was similar in diseased and control livers. The number of CD14-positive cells correlated with advanced fibrosis in HH, PBC, HCV but not in NASH. The number of CD14-positive cells was increased with advanced inflammatory activity in HCV. CD14-positive cells were often associated with &#945;-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts in fibrous septa. In conclusion, many forms of human chronic liver disease demonstrate increased numbers of CD14-positive macrophages/monocytes which are associated with fibrous septa and myofibroblasts. To determine whether CD14-positive cells contribute to fibrogenesis, experimental models of liver injury were used in chapters 5 and 6. The aim of chapter 5 was to determine whether CD14-positive macrophages/monocytes are detected in a bile duct ligation model of liver injury. To accomplish this aim, a novel antibody to rat CD14 was developed as described in chapter 4. A time-course study was undertaken in rats following bile duct ligation for up to 14 days. An increase in the number of hepatic CD14-positive cells was detected early following bile duct ligation, and was associated with increased gene expression of &#945;-smooth muscle actin and procollagen I. Thus, myofibroblastic transformation in this model was associated with increased numbers of CD14-positive cells suggesting a possible relationship between the two phenomena. In order to specifically evaluate the role of CD14 in myofibroblastic transformation, a final study in CD14 knockout (KO) mice was undertaken in chapter 6</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver -- Diseases -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Fibrosis -- Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Kupffer cells</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Monocytes</field><field name="subject">CD antigens</field><field name="subject">CD14</field><field name="subject">Liver fibrosis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of magnetic thin films--exchange bias systems</field><field name="creator">Pang, Wenjie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Although exchange bias was discovered more than four decades ago, a satisfactory understanding of every instance of exchange bias observed in experiment has not yet emerged. Understanding exchange bias is complicated by many factors. For example, details of the antiferromagnet interface structure set up during the initial field cooling, thermal activation processes in the ferromagnet and antiferromagnet, and domain formation and domain wall movement in the antiferromagnet are all important in determining features associated with exchange bias. Two exchange bias systems are investigated in this thesis. One is a disordered system: a single layer Co/CoO film with random interfaces prepared by a reactive RF sputtering technique. The other is a &#8216;model&#8217; system of Fe/KFeF 3 bilayers with compensated interfaces prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The central theme of this work is to understand exchange bias and other related magnetic properties in these two very different systems. The Co/CoO exchange bias system studied here is different in structure from conventional exchange bias systems such as bilayer and multilayer systems where interfaces between ferromagnet and antiferromagnet are reasonably well defined. In this Co/CoO system, the Co and CoO is in the form of particles distributed randomly in a sputtered film. The interfaces between the Co and CoO are randomly distributed and may not be continuous over a large length scale. More importantly, the interface area is dependent on the shape and size of the particles and on their distribution. Many unique magnetic properties are related to the random interface in this system. For example, exchange bias and coercivity obtained at low temperatures are very large due to the large interface area between Co and CoO particles. The interface area can be controlled by changing the Co/CoO mass ratio in the film. Unlike in bilayer systems, film thickness in this single layer Co/CoO system turns out not to be critical for exchange bias and coercivity. The independence of film thickness may be technically important. More interestingly, because the interface is random, exchange bias can be setup by field cooling in any direction. Both training and magnetic viscosity effects were studied and provided evidence of thermal activation processes in this Co/CoO system. Training is explained as formation of a domain wall in the CoO with motion limited locally due to limited continuity of Synthesis and Characterization of Magnetic Thin Films - Exchange Bias Systems interfaces between the Co and CoO. Specific magnetization measurements over time were made and studied using viscosity theory. The magnetic viscosity was found to be strongly temperature dependent.

One such key area is the understanding of the micromechanics and thermodynamics of the deformation mechanisms, such that their deformation behaviour can be accurately predicted and modelled. Furthermore, most research involves polycrystalline NiTi of varying compositions and processing history, both of which complicate and damage the internal structure of the matrix even before deformation. This work aims to study the micromechanisms of deformation of near-equiatomic NiTi alloys, both in polycrystalline and single crystal forms, with particular attention given to the commonly observed phenomena of Luders-like deformation behaviour and deformation induced martensite stabilisation. This work was carried out in three sections. Firstly, the tensile deformation of polycrystalline NiTi samples via martensite reorientation and stress-induced martensitic transformations was carried out. The samples were deformed to various stages of deformation and then thermally cycled to study the thermomechanical response to deformation as a means to explore the various mechanisms of deformation. Next, the deformation and post-deformation transformation behaviour of NiTi single crystals were studied to verify the effect of grain boundaries and other hypotheses raised regarding the deformation mechanisms. The single crystal samples were deformed along three low-index axial orientations. Finally, microscopic analysis was carried out on as-annealed and the deformed polycrystal and single crystal samples by means of transmission electron microscopy.

The work presented in this thesis describes the cloning and characterisation of promoter regions from a clinical isolate of H. pylori, and the development of an alternative, non-radioactive method for verifying the location of transcriptional start sites of bacterial promoters. H. pylori 4187E promoters were randomly cloned into the promoter-trap vector pKK232-8 in Escherichia coli DH5&#945; using two sets of restriction enzymes. Vector pKK232-8 contains a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Seventy-four promoter-containing clones were isolated from selective media based on their resistance to chloramphenicol. The strength of each promoter was analysed qualitatively, using chloramphenicol minimum inhibitory concentrations, and quantitatively, using CAT assays following exposure of the clones to pH 4 and pH 7. Selected promoter fragments were subcloned into the GFP reporter vector pFPV25, containing a promoterless gfp gene. The subclones were exposed to buffered LB broth at pH 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, for varying lengths of time, to study acid-induced regulation of gene expression. Subclones were examined qualitatively, using visual examination of GFP fluorescence and fluorescence microscopy, and quantitatively, using flow cytometry following acid shock. DNA sequences were determined for 61 of the 74 H. pylori promoters, and sequence alignments with the published H. pylori strains (26695 and J99) were performed. The transcriptional start site of 27 H. pylori promoter fragments was experimentally mapped using a fluorescence-based primer extension protocol developed by our group. Potential -35 and -10 sequences were identified for each promoter, and a new consensus sequence for H. pylori promoters was proposed based upon these results.

Throughout its history, static-pictorial computer art has been extensively maligned. In fact, no other twentieth-century art form has elicited such a negative and often hostile response. In locating the destabilising forces that affect and shape computer art, this thesis identifies a complex interplay of ideological and discursive forces that influence the way computer art has been and is received by the mainstream artworld and the cultural community at large. One of the central factors that contributed to computer art&#8217;s marginality was its emergence in that precarious zone between science and art, at a time when the perceived division between the humanistic and scientific cultures was reaching its apogee. The polarising force inherent in the &#8220;two cultures&#8221; debate framed much of the prejudice towards early computer art. For many of its critics, computer art was the product of the same discursive assumptions, methodologies and vocabulary as science. Moreover, it invested heavily in the metaphors and mythologies of science, especially logic and mathematics. This close relationship with science continued as computer art looked to scientific disciplines and emergent techno-science paradigms for inspiration and insight. While recourse to science was a major impediment to computer art&#8217;s acceptance by the artworld orthodoxy, it was the sustained hostility towards the computer that persistently wore away at the computer art enterprise. The anticomputer response came from several sources, both humanist and anti-humanist. The first originated with mainstream critics whose strong humanist tendencies led them to reproach computerised art for its mechanical sterility. A comparison with aesthetically and theoretically similar art forms of the era reveals that the criticism of computer art is motivated by the romantic fear that a computerised surrogate had replaced the artist. Such usurpation undermined some of the keystones of modern Western art, such as notions of artistic &#8220;genius&#8221; and &#8220;creativity&#8221;. Any attempt to rationalise the human creative faculty, as many of the scientists and technologists were claiming to do, would for the humanist critics have transgressed what they considered the primordial mystique of art.  Criticism of computer art also came from other quarters. Dystopianism gained popularity in the 1970s within the reactive counter-culture and avant-garde movements. Influenced by the pessimistic and cynical sentiment of anti-humanist writings, many within the arts viewed the computer as an emblem of rationalisation, a powerful instrument in the overall subordination of the individual to the emerging technocracy</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer art -- Appreciation -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Art and technology -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Art and science -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">New media</field><field name="subject">Art history</field><field name="subject">Computer art</field><field name="subject">Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulator T cells in murine AIDS</field><field name="creator">Paun, Andrea</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  In the last ten years regulator T (Tr) cells have re-emerged as an integral part of the immune system. Research in this field has rapidly demonstrated the role of these cells in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and their involvement in disease. Tr cells are generated in the thymus as a normal part of the developing immune system. Furthermore, antigen-specific Tr cells are induced in the periphery by a mechanism which is yet to be completely elucidated, but is likely to involve dendritic cells. Tr cells play an important role in autoimmune disease, transplantation tolerance, cancer. Most recently Tr cell involvement has been demonstrated in a growing number of infectious diseases. Tr cell induction was reported in Friend Virus infection at the commencement of this study, and subsequent to publication of our findings have also been identified in FIV and HIV. Murine AIDS (MAIDS) is a fatal chronic retroviral infection induced in susceptible strains of mice by infection with BM5d, a replication defective virus, in a viral mixture which is designated LP-BM5. The manipulation of Tr cells detailed in this thesis and the related publication represent the first reported therapy utilising targeted removal of Tr cells. Chapter 1 summarises the literature relevant to this study up to November 2004. Chapter 2 details the materials and methodologies used in this work. Chapter 3 investigates whether Tr cells are involved in the development of murine AIDS, particularly in the early stages of infection.

The efficacy of treatment was found to be time dependent and was shown to abrogate disease progression maximally when given at day 14 pi. Treatment with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody was also found to be efficacious at day 14 pi and confirmed the identity of the Tr cells as being CD4+ T cells.

The first is that the sublime is a principal pleasure of science fiction. The second is that the conditions for the emergence of both the sublime and science fiction lie in the modern developments of technology, mass economy and imperialism. Maritime and optical technologies; the imagination that accompanied imperialism; and the influence of capitalism furnished the cognition by which the pleasures of both science fiction and the sublime came into being. The third claim is that a historical conception of the sublime, one that changes according to the different circumstances in which it appears, offers privileged insights onto changes within the genre. To make such extensive claims it has been necessary to make a cognitive map of the development of both the sublime and science fiction. This map reaches from the Ancient Romans, Lucian and Longinus; to Thomas More, Jonathan Swift, Johannes Kepler, Voltaire and Immanuel Kant; to Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. This thesis then examines how the features of these fictions mutate in the twentieth-century fiction of A.E. van Vogt, Clifford Simak, Philip K. Dick, Arthur C. Clarke, Ivan Yefremov, the Strugatsky brothers, J.G. Ballard, Pamela Zoline, Ursula Le Guin, Vonda McIntyre, Octavia Butler, Kim Stanley Robinson, Stephen Baxter, William Gibson, Ken MacLeod and Stanislaw Lem. These writers are considered in their own specific periods, and in their national contexts, as they create pleasures that are contingent upon changes to their own worlds. In representing these changes, their fictions defamiliarise the anxieties of the reading subject. They transcend the contradictions of their times with a sublime that betrays its own conditions of transcendence.

Soil-plant interactions can be diverse and site-specific within a disturbed landscape. The main purpose of the present study is to evaluate soil characteristics and landscape indices in relation to natural plant growth and soil development under different conditions and for diverse materials. A comprehensive study has been carried out to evaluate spontaneous soil development and plant colonization on various regolith materials at a railway cutting near Jarrahdale bauxite mine and on various substrates comprising waste rock, weathered regolith and replaced topsoil at Scotia (Norseman, Western Australia) and Kelian (East Kalimantan, Indonesia). At Jarrahdale soil development has occurred slowly over 36 years in relation to morphological changes in surface horizons. Soils at several locations exhibit substantial changes in color, texture and structure. The slow soil development is primarily due to low biomass and litter contributions (&#732;1 Mg/ha) from colonizing plants (e.g. Dryandra sessilis, Eucalyptus marginata and low shrubs) on the cutting shelf and slow litter decomposition. Nutrient accumulation is up to 5 kg N/ha, and 0.5 kg/ha for P and K. Surface soil samples from Jarrahdale are generally acidic (pH &lt; 5.1) and contain low concentrations of total soil carbon (20 g/kg) and nutrients of total nitrogen (0.73 g/kg), bicarbonate-extractable phosphorus (bic-P) (&lt; 2 mg/kg), bic-K (37 mg/kg) and total exchangeable bases (&lt;1.1 cmol/kg, with 24 % base saturation). Soil properties at the Scotia waste dump are mainly associated with alkaline (mean pH = 9) and saline conditions (EC1:5 = 1.01 dS/m). Exchangeable base values are high with average concentrations of exchangeable Ca of 18 cmol/kg and exchangeable Mg of 6 cmol/kg, thus these elements are not a limiting factor for plant nutrition. Patchy plant growth on the waste dump is mostly related to differences in water availability in the arid region and to salinity such that halophytes (saltbushes Maireana and Atriplex) colonize many parts of the waste dump together with some Melaleuca and Eucalyptus species</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Indonesia -- Kalimantan Timur</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Indonesia -- Kalimantan Timur</field><field name="subject">Plant colonization -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant colonization -- Indonesia -- Kalimantan Timur</field><field name="subject">Soil ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil ecology -- Indonesia -- Kalimantan Timur</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the cognitive nature of general intelligence</field><field name="creator">Davies, Simon Rolf</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Central to the study of general intelligence is Spearman?s g, one definition of which is general fluid reasoning ability. At a cognitive level of explanation, it has recently been hypothesized that individual differences in g is based in the executive functions of the frontal lobes. This theory can be contrasted with the theory that the fount of g is speed of information processing. The aim of this thesis was to test the idea that the two contrasting theories of g could be reconciled by invoking an alternative theory which suggests that there may be two g?s  one related to individual differences in intelligence and attributable to differences in speed of information processing and one related to the development of intelligence and based in executive functions of the frontal lobes. This was done with a series of neuropsychological studies that tested groups of adults and children with and without putative central nervous system damage on tests of fluid intelligence, executive function, goal-neglect, and speed of information processing. In study 1, three adults with focal frontal lobe lesions and ten adults with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were administered three common intelligence tests. In comparison to premorbid and crystallized measures on intelligence, the majority of frontal patients exhibited impaired fluid g. In study 2, 10 patients with FTD, 8 patients with Alzheimer?s disease (AD), 10 adult controls, and 15 adults with low fluid g, were tested on a fast and slow version of a goal-neglect task (thought to measure executive functioning) and a measure of speed of processing. A classical double dissociation was found. Frontal patients with impaired fluid g displayed goal-neglect but intact speed of information processing whereas the adults with low fluid g exhibited slowed speed of information 2 processing but not goal-neglect. It was concluded that the link between fluid g and goal-neglect in adults (demonstrated by previous research) was based on a speed of information processing confound in the goal-neglect task. In study 3, a series of hierarchical regressions were conducted to analyse the performances of 116 children aged 6- to 11-years on all tests.

It represents the latest in a long line of similar initiatives which the U.S. has been pursuing almost since the inception of the aviation industry. Essentially  &#8220;Open Skies&#8221; is little more than a specific type of bilateral aviation agreement between two nations (and often between more than two nations) which typically provides for open entry on routes, unrestricted capacity and frequency on routes, and unrestricted air traffic rights.  The significance of Open Skies agreements is that they appear to encapsulate general world-wide trends towards open economies characterised by a minimum of government interference and a maximum reliance on market forces to allocate scarce resources ... Australia however is not one of the nations seeking to become a party to such an agreement with the U.S. despite attempts by that nation to persuade Australia to do so and the question is: Can or should Australia resist attempts by the United States to bring it within the expanding umbrella of Open Skies, or are there other practical alternatives open to Australia? After examining the history of the development of Open Skies agreements and their international legal foundation, this thesis argues that there are strong considerations of policy and economics why Australia should embrace Open Skies initially at least on a regional basis centred in the Asia Pacific region, rather than with the United States. Implicit in that proposal is the fact that in terms of its constitutional and legal system, Australia has the legal capacity to enter into Open Skies agreements. The parties to such a regional Open Skies agreement might at a later date choose to enter into a multilateral Open Skies agreement with the United States, if economic and political conditions are suitable for them to do so. On the assumption that a form of Open Skies policy will eventually be adopted by Australia this thesis examines the constitutional and domestic legal regulatory framework for aviation within Australia, and the changes if any which would be required to it, if Australia was to embrace such a policy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aeronautics, Commercial -- Deregulation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Aeronautics, Commercial -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Aeronautics, Commercial -- Deregulation -- United States</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil organic matter decomposition : effects of organic matter addition on phosphorus dynamics in lateritic soils</field><field name="creator">Yusran, Fadly Hairannoor</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Relationships between the persistence of organic matter added to soil, the dynamics of soil organic carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) were examined in four experiments on lateritic soils of Western Australia. The main objective was to quantify the release of P following organic matter application in soils which have high P adsorbing capacity. Another objective was to confirm that due to its recalcitrant materials, the effect of peat lasted longer in soil than other sources of organic matter in terms of increasing plant-available P fractions. Three experiments were conducted under glasshouse conditions for various lengths of time, with nine- to twelve-month incubations to investigate these hypotheses. As expected, organic matter with lower C:N ratios than peat (lucerne hay) decomposed more rapidly compared with peat, and the most active mineralisation took place within the first three months of incubation. Soil organic-C (extracted by 0.5 M K2SO4) had a significant positive correlation with P extracted with 0.5 M NaHCO pH 8.53. For a higher application rate (120 ton ha-1), peat was better than wheat straw and lucerne hay in increasing extractable bicarbonate-P concentrations in soil, especially at incubation times up to 12 months. Throughout the experiment, peat was associated with a steady increase in all parameters measured. In contrast to peat, nutrient release from lucerne hay and wheat straw was rapid and diminished over time. There was a tendency for organic-C (either in the form of total extractable organic-C or microbial biomass-C) to steadily increase in soil with added peat throughout the experiment. Unlike wheat straw and lucerne hay, extractable organic-C from peat remained in soil and there was less C loss in the form of respiration. Therefore, peat persisted and sequestered C to the soil system for a longer time than the other source of organic matter. Freshly added organic matter was expected to have a greater influence on P transformation from adsorbed forms in lateritic soils than existing soil organic matter. By removing the existing soil organic matter, the effect of freshly applied organic matter can be determine separately from that of the existing soil organic matter for a similar organic-C content. In order to do this, some soil samples were combusted up to 450&#176; C to eliminate inherent soil organic matter. The release of P was greater when organic-C from fresh organic matter was applied to combusted soils than in uncombusted soils that contained the existing soil organic matter. The exception only applied for parameters related to soil micro-organisms such as biomass-C and phosphatase. For such parameters, new soil organic matter did not create conditions favourable for organisms to increase in activity despite the abundance of organic matter available. More non-extractable-P was formed in combusted soils compared to bicarbonate-P and it contributed to more than 50% of total-P. As for the first experiment, peat also showed a constant effect in increasing bicarbonate extractable-P in the soil</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Humus -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Organic wastes as soil amendments -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil absorption and adsorption -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Phosphorus content -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Laterite -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Peat as fertilizer -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil organic matter</field><field name="subject">Lateritic soils</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Phosphate adsorption</field><field name="subject">Organinc amendments</field><field name="subject">Peat</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalizing local girls : the representation of adolescents in Indonesian female teen magazines</field><field name="creator">Handajani, Suzie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The aim of this thesis is to describe and analyze how Indonesian female teen magazines represent Indonesian adolescents. Female teen magazines are an important source of information on how gender is constructed in Indonesia. The thesis will contribute modestly not only to knowledge in the immediate fields of gender relations and adolescence in Indonesia but also to the wider body of literature on the relationships among gender, capitalism and patriarchy and the role of print media in shaping these relationships. Consequently, I place my discussion of how adolescents are presented in Indonesian female teen magazines within a larger context of global-local interaction at the national level. This research places Indonesian female teen magazines within the wider genre of women&#8217;s magazines. Most of the research on female magazines is focused on women rather than female adolescents, but because gender relations in society cut across the generations, this research is relevant to the study of magazines for female adolescents. Theories about women&#8217;s magazines provide insight into women&#8217;s magazines as a forum of expression that reflects gender and power relations in society. Teen magazines exist due to the rising significance of Indonesian adolescents. Indonesian adolescents emerged as a significant social group because of the course of national history and the state&#8217;s national development. Adolescence in this thesis is not treated as a biological stage of human physical development, but as the result of changes in the perception and treatment of young people by the society in which they appear. In the analysis I use Merry White&#8217;s argument with regards to marketing strategies to adolescents. I claim that Indonesian female teen magazines often have a conflicting double agenda in representing adolescents.&#185;Teen magazines have to make money for publishers and advertisers in order to achieve their own financial security and, at the same time, these magazines have to acknowledge local values in order to be accepted by the society. For marketing purpose, adolescents in teen magazines are represented as a modern social group. Modernity in the magazines is associated with a globalized western popular culture. My particular interest is to explore to what extent and in what ways western influences (as the standard of modernity) are employed to construct representations of female adolescents. I argue that the ways the magazines construct their own ideals of the &#8220;west&#8221; are related to the ways they construct images of Indonesian female adolescents.

This study presents CTD and ADCP data together with concurrent wind and satellite imagery, to provide a description of the summer surface circulation pattern along the continental margin, and the hydrography present in the upper 1km of ocean, between latitudes 21&#176; and 35&#176;S. It also discusses the outcome of a numerical modelling study that examined the physical factors contributing to a bifurcation event persistently observed in satellite imagery at Point Cloates. The region comprises a complex system of four surface water types and current systems. The Leeuwin Current dominated the surface flow, transporting lower salinity, warmer water poleward along the shelf-break, and causing downwelling. Its signature &#8216;aged&#8217; from a warm (24.7&#176;C), lower salinity (34.6) water in the north to a cooler (21.9&#176;C), more saline (35.2) water in the south, as a result of 2-4Sv geostrophic inflow of offshore waters. The structure and strength of the current altered with changing bottom topographies. The Ningaloo Current flowed along the northernmost inner coast of the Gascoyne shelf, carrying upwelled water and re-circulated Leeuwin Current water from the south. Bifurcation of the Ningaloo Current was seen south of the coastal promontory at Point Cloates. Numerical modelling demonstrated a combination of southerly winds and coastal and bottom topography off Point Cloates to be responsible for the recirculation, and indicated that the strength of southerly winds affect recirculation. Hypersaline Shark Bay outflow influenced shelf waters at the Bay&#8217;s mouth and to the south of the Bay. The Capes Current, a wind-driven current from south of the study region was identified as a cooler, more saline water mass flowing northward. Results of the hydrography study show five different water masses present in the upper-ocean.

Corporate failures such as Enron, WorldCom and Tyco in the United States and One.tel and HIH in Australia have advanced the view that internal governance mechanisms and private managerial incentives systematically fail to ensure timely and reliable disclosure of bad news (e.g. Jensen, 2004). This thesis appraises the conventional view by investigating managers&#8217; communications with the capital market during a period of sudden, poor financial performance. We study 74 firms that are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange [ASX], which experience an adverse earnings shock between 1994 and 1999. An adverse earnings shock is defined as a year of positive, increasing net income, followed by two contiguous years of negative or declining net income. The Australian setting for this study provides access to a richer database of investor communications than previously utilised in the literature, including management discussion and analysis, strategy disclosures, earnings and revenue forecasts, earnings preannouncements, business segment forecasts, dividend changes and share repurchases. Exploiting this extensive data set, we find that managers actually step up their investor communications activities around an adverse earnings shock. In the low litigation Australian setting, we are able to rule out litigation-avoidance incentives as a major explanatory factor. We investigate whether the increase in the volume of investor communications is aimed at mitigating information asymmetry, signalling a turnaround in financial performance or simply due to management &#8220;hype&#8221;</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations, Australian</field><field name="subject">Corporations -- Australia -- Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Corporations -- Australia -- Finance</field><field name="subject">Corporations -- Australia -- Investor relations</field><field name="subject">Corporations -- Australia -- Management</field><field name="subject">Financial statements</field><field name="subject">Earnings shock</field><field name="subject">Voluntary disclosure</field><field name="subject">Signalling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The affective response to ambiguous stimuli in depression</field><field name="creator">Goggin, Leigh S.</field><field name="description">Cognitive theory of depression predicts that the illness is associated with an information processing bias that interprets ambiguous information in a mood-congruent or depressive fashion. This negative interpretative bias may serve as a vulnerability factor or maintenance mechanism for a depressive illness. The majority of studies investigating such interpretative biases rely primarily on subjective experimental methodologies (eg., evaluative feedback and self-report) that are vulnerable to experimenter demand effects, response selection biases, and the influence of autobiographical memories. In addition, the results from these studies have been mixed, leading to no firm evidence for the existence of a depression-linked interpretative bias for ambiguous material. In order to avoid the limitations that have plagued subjective research, the present study utilised two of the most promising objective physiological measures of assessing interpretation: the Rapid Serial Viewing Presentation (RSVP) procedure and the affective modulation of the human eye blink reflex. The modified RSVP experiment recorded the reaction time of participants reading a textual scenario that was composed of an opening ambiguous sentence and various emotionally valenced continuations. Interpretation of the ambiguous sentence could be inferred from the reaction time as comprehension latency is inversely related to perceived plausibility. The affective modulation experiment recorded the blink amplitudes of participants startled while performing an imagery task. Blink amplitudes are augmented by negative stimuli and inhibited by hedonic stimuli. Thus, the affective interpretation of ambiguous stimuli could be inferred from the size of the recorded blink response. The results of both experiments did not support the predictions made by cognitive theory. There was no difference in the reaction time responses to the various textual stimuli between 2 depressed outpatients and healthy controls. However, antidepressant medication did have an influence upon the ability of patients to correctly judge the plausibility of the emotionally valenced continuation sentences. With regard to the eye blink experiment, there was also no difference between the depressed outpatients and the controls in terms of size of blink amplitude to the various categories of affective stimuli. Depressive, ambiguous, and distorted stimuli did not augment blink amplitudes in healthy controls or depressed patients without social anxiety disorder. However, depressed patients with a comorbid diagnosis of social anxiety disorder did react to the ambiguous stimuli in an aversive and anxious manner as indicated by increased blink amplitudes. This may be due to the social aspect of the experimental context, which engenders fears of evaluation and performance anxiety. The eye blink procedure can therefore be compromised by group selection, as the comorbidity of anxiety and depression can confound the investigation of depression-linked interpretative biases. In addition, the failure of depressive stimuli to augment blink amplitudes may render the procedure insensitive to the selection of such biases</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression, Mental</field><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk</field><field name="creator">Tan, Boon-Kiang</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The cost of managing osteoporotic fractures places a significant financial burden on the health-care system. To reduce the fracture burden, early identification of fracture risk is essential to allow early intervention. The limitations associated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), such as limited sensitivity and specificity, cost, ionising radiation and accessibility, have resulted in the emergence of other technologies for assessing bone fragility. An example is the portable and non-ionising quantitative ultrasound (QUS) technology. The discriminatory power of quantitative ultrasonometry in fracture risk identification, either independently or in combination with other established risk factors, currently remains contentious. It is recommended that fracture risk assessment should not only focus on bone status, but also on the risk of falls. Additionally, it has been noted that disability arising from osteoporotic fractures, even when these fractures are not identified clinically, can translate into psychosocial symptoms and a poorer perception of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The primary aim of the present study was to investigate if a composite model comprising: calcaneal QUS, falls risk and HRQoL assessments, can identify a group of elderly women at high risk of osteoporotic fracture from those at lower risk. One hundred and four community-dwelling women (mean age 71.3 &#177;5.8 years) were recruited for this study. These women underwent a series of tests that included: DXA bone mineral density (BMD) evaluation of the proximal femur and lumbar spine (L1  L4); calcaneal QUS measurement; spinal radiography; rasterstereographic back surface curvature (BSC) examination; and performance-based assessment of strength, mobility and balance.

Reactive-ion-etching (RIE) in a H2&#8260;CH4 gas mixture, a process primarily used for material removal, will cause p-to-n type conversion in HgCdTe. It has been shown, by several groups, that infrared photodiodes fabricated with a process technology based on RIE p-to-n type-conversion achieve high yields with state-of-the-art performance. For this technology to be accepted RIE formed n-on-p photodiodes must demonstrate junction stability under normal operating conditions. Along with a stable junction, a compatible passivation technology that is able to withstand processing and operation temperatures is required. This thesis investigates the RIE p-to-n type-conversion mechanism in HgCdTe with the aim of demonstrating bake stable RIE formed junctions, and gaining an insight to the processes by which RIE type-conversion occurs. In pursuing these aims, two complimentary objectives were required, namely, the development of a passivation technology compatible with RIE formed junctions, and the development of a detailed I-V/Rd-V model for HgCdTe photodiodes. As a result of these objectives, this thesis presents a double-layer ZnS on CdTe passivation technology with which stable RIE-formed n-on-p junctions in HgCdTe are demonstrated.

I examine cultural differences relating to mothering and argue that the South Asian culture in which these migrant women were socialized can impact greatly on how they experience the feelings of what is called &#8220;postnatal depression&#8221; in the Western medical arena. I carried out ethnographic research among the members of the Bangladeshi and Indian communities in Perth. The main focus group of this study is first time mothers who gave birth in Australia, but I also worked with other women who had grown up children. Due to migration the South Asian women and their families experienced social isolation, cultural differences, language difficulties, economic hardship and low job satisfaction. Moreover, when these women gave birth in Perth they were faced with a lack of physical and emotional support, and also distress at not being able to perform their traditional birth rituals. Their difficult situations led the women to cry, feel despondent, to suffer and to experience a sense of hopelessness. Their painful postnatal feelings can be defined as an illness - depression - by the Western medicine. However, I found these women did not perceive their negative postnatal feelings as an illness, but accepted them as a part of life. I analysed these women&#8217;s postnatal psychological understandings about &#8220;postnatal depression&#8221; by examining the South Asian convention of female virtue which is practiced through restrictions on female behaviour. The migrant women in my study, having internalizing the South Asian cultural schema of womanhood, articulate their negative postnatal feelings as a prerequisite of motherhood. In this thesis I argue that feelings are not the totality of experience, rather, experience is also formulated by the particular sociocultural perspective of the individual who is having the experience. The culture a person belongs to, defines how that person will experience his or her feelings.

The only available means for controlling pea weevil at the present time is with chemical pesticides. The aim of this study was to introgress natural pea weevil resistance, derived from the wild pea species, Pisum fulvum Sibth. &amp; Sm. into cultivated field pea and devise strategies for screening for the resistance with breeding applications. Traditional breeding methods were used to transfer pea weevil resistance from P. fulvum accession &#8216;ATC113&#8217; to cultivated field pea, cv. &#8216;Pennant&#8217;. Progeny derived from this population were examined for inheritance of pod and seed resistance. Seed resistance in F2 plants segregated in a ratio of 1:37:26 (resistant: mixed response: susceptible), indicating a trigenic mode of inheritance (1:63), with at least three major recessive genes controlling pea weevil resistance. Seed resistance was conserved over consecutive generations (F2 to F5) and was successfully transferred to populations crossed with a second adapted field pea variety&#8216;Helena&#8217;. Pod resistance presented as a quantitative trait in the F2 population, but this resistance was not retained in subsequent generations. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were sought in the parents and in resistant and susceptible F3 plants. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis was used to identify 13 AFLP markers with a statistically significant association with pea weevil resistance and 23 with pea weevil susceptibility. Principal coordinate analysis (PCO) showed that the AFLP marker loci formed clusters in the PCO space, which could indicate the three proposed gene locations. Eight AFLP markers were cloned, sequenced and converted to sequence characterised amplified regions (SCAR). Two SCAR markers, SC47359 and SC47435 were polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible parents. Both markers co-segregated with the resistant lines and with 30-36% of susceptible lines. Plants which did not possess either band were highly susceptible. The other PCR products were either monomorphic between the resistant and susceptible parents or produced more than one band product. A range of phenotypic traits was measured in the F2 population derived from the hybridisation between P. fulvum and P. sativum and associations with pea weevil resistance were made. In the F2 population, pea weevil resistance was not correlated with any of the negative traits originating from the wild parent, such as increased basal branching, dark seed coat or small seed size, neither was resistance correlated with flower colour, flowering time or seeds per pod. Pea weevil resistance should therefore be transferable with minimal linkage drag. A convenient morphological marker, such as flower or seed colour was not identified in this study based on these results. Using principal component analysis (PCA) as a visual tool, resistant and semi-resistant plants in the F3 and &#8216;backcross&#8217; introgression populations were identified with improved trait performance compared with the wild parent</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pisum sativum</field><field name="subject">Pisum fulvum</field><field name="subject">Pea Weevil</field><field name="subject">Interspecific</field><field name="subject">Hybridisation</field><field name="subject">Breeding</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Inheritance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological traits associated with tolerance to salinity and waterlogging in the genus `Hordeum'</field><field name="creator">Garthwaite, Alaina Jane</field><field name="description">Wild Hordeum species, from the four genome groups of X, H, I and Y, were assessed for physiological traits associated with tolerance to salinity and waterlogging. When grown in saline conditions, a number of wild Hordeum species had exceptional &#8216;exclusion&#8217; of Na+ and Cl- from the young leaves, and also maintained tissue K+ concentrations, compared with Hordum vulgare ssp. vulgare (cv. &#8216;Golf&#8217;). For example, at 150 mol m-3 NaCl, the K+:Na+ in youngest, fully expanded leaf blades of wild Hordeum species averaged 5.2, compared with 0.8 in H. vulgare. H. marinum was more salt tolerant than H. vulgare, with a relative growth rate 30% higher than H. vulgare at 150 mol m-3 NaCl. At 300 mol m-3 NaCl, glycinebetaine plus proline contributed to 15% of &#960;sap in expanding leaf blades of H. marinum, compared with 8% in H. vulgare. When grown in stagnant conditions, 16 accessions (approximately half of those evaluated) formed a barrier to radial O2 loss (ROL) in basal zones of adventitious roots. In the Triticeae, this trait had previously only been described in one species, H. marinum. The barrier to ROL occurred only in accessions from wetland or intermediate habitats, and was also related to genome type, being present in accessions with the X or the H genome (Hordeum vulgare has the I genome). In stagnant conditions, aerenchyma formed was, on average; 22% in accessions with the X genome; 19% in those with the H genome; and 15 and 16% in those with the I or the Y genomes, respectively. The combination of a barrier to ROL and aerenchyma enhances longitudinal O2 movement in adventitious roots, permitting roots to penetrate deeper into anaerobic substrates. In H. marinum, induction of the barrier to ROL was associated with a 97% reduction in apparent O2 diffusivity across the external layers of the basal zones of roots, compared with near the root tip. The barrier results from physical resistance to radial O2 movement, although when roots were cooled to suppress respiration some additional leakage of O2 was detected, indicating respiration also contributes to the low rates of ROL from the basal regions of roots. Low radial O2 permeability in the roots of stagnantly-treated H. marinum was associated with secondary thickening, putatively lignin or suberin deposits, in the hypodermis. These changes in root structure, however, did not influence root hydraulic conductivity, assessed for individual adventitious roots and whole root systems. Thus, diversity amongst Hordeum species in expression of traits for tolerance to waterlogging (an inducible barrier to ROL and aerenchyma) and salinity (Na+ and Cl- &#8216;exclusion&#8217;) were documented in this study. Traits for root aeration did not compromise the capacity of roots to take up water, presumably being of importance for growth in soils with fluctuating water levels (i.e. wet/dry cycles). The high degree of salinity tolerance in several Hordeum species, and especially in H. marinum, is consistent with field observations that these species occur in salt affected areas</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hordeum</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging</field><field name="subject">Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of variable offspring provisioning</field><field name="creator">Dziminski, Martin A.</field><field name="description">Most theoretical models predict an optimal offspring size that maximises parental fitness. Variation in the quality of the offspring environment can result in multiple offspring size optima and therefore variation of offspring provisioning can evolve. Variation in offspring provisioning is common and found across a variety of taxa. It can be defined as between populations, explained by optimality models, or between and within individuals, neither so easily explained by optimality models. My research focused on the evolution of variable offspring provisioning by testing theoretical models relating to variation in offspring provisioning between and within individuals. Using comparative methods, I found a positive relationship between intraclutch variation in offspring provisioning and variation in the quality of the offspring environment in a suite of pond breeding frogs. This positive relationship provided evidence that patterns of variable offspring provisioning are related to the offspring environment. This study also identified a species (Crinia georgiana) with high variation in offspring provisioning on which to focus further investigations. High variation in offspring provisioning occured between and within individuals of this species independent of female phenotype and a trade-off in offspring size and number existed. In laboratory studies, increased yolk per offspring led to increased fitness per offspring. Parental fitness calculations revealed that in high quality conditions production of small more numerous offspring resulted in higher parental fitness, but in lower quality conditions the production of large offspring resulted in the highest parental fitness. This was confirmed in field experiments under natural conditions using molecular markers to trace offspring to clutches of known provisioning, allowing me to measure exact parental fitness. The strategy of high variation in offspring size within clutches can be of benefit when the future of the offspring environment is not known to the parents: as a form of bet-hedging. Further study of the offspring environment revealed that conditions such as density dependent fitness loss, spatial variation in habitat quality, and non-random offspring dispersal, can combine to create the conditions predicted by theoretical models to maintain a strategy of variable offspring provisioning in the population. My research provides a comprehensive empirical test of the theory of variable offspring provisioning</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bet-hedging</field><field name="subject">Maternal investment</field><field name="subject">Egg size</field><field name="subject">Offspring size</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uniaxial behaviour of suction caissons in soft deposits in deepwater</field><field name="creator">Chen, Wen</field><field name="description">Suction caissons are a cost-effective alternative to traditional piles in deep to ultradeep waters. No design rule has been available on the axial capacity of suction caissons as part of the mooring system in soft sediments. In this research, a series of centrifuge tests were performed using instrumented model caissons, to investigate the axial capacity and radial stress changes around caissons during installation, consolidation and vertical pullout in normally consolidated, lightly overconsolidated and sensitive clays. Total pressure transducers instrumented on the caisson wall were calibrated for various conditions. The radial total stress acting on the external wall varied almost linearly during penetration and extraction of the caisson, with smaller gradients observed during post-consolidation pullout. Minimum difference was found in the penetration resistance and the radial total stress for caissons installed by jacking or by suction, suggesting that the mode of soil flow at the caisson tip is similar under these two types of installation. Observed soil heave showed that the soil particles at the caisson tip flow about evenly outside and inside the caisson during suction installation. Comparison was made between measurements and various theoretical predictions, on both the radial stress changes during caisson installation, and the radial effective stress after consolidation. Significant under-predictions on excess pore pressure changes, consolidation times and external shaft friction ratios were found for the NGI Method, based on the assumption that the caisson wall is accommodated entirely by inward motion of the clay during suction installation. Obvious over-predictions by the MTD approach were found in both stress changes and shaft capacity of the caissons. A simple form of cavity expansion method was found to give reasonable estimations of stress changes and post-consolidation external shaft friction. A model for predicting the penetration resistance of suction caissons in clay was evaluated. Upper and lower bound values of external shaft friction ratio during uplift loading after consolidation were derived. Uplift capacity of caissons under sustained loading and cyclic loading were investigated, revealing approximately 15 to 30% reduction of the capacity compared to that under monotonic loading. External shaft friction ratios and reverse end-bearing capacity factors were both found to be significantly lower than those under monotonic loading</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caissons -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Axial loads</field><field name="subject">Deep-sea moorings -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Suction caisson</field><field name="subject">Clay</field><field name="subject">Deepwater</field><field name="subject">Radial stress</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the antimalarial activity of retinol and assessment of lipid peroxidation in malaria infection</field><field name="creator">Hamzah, Juliana</field><field name="description">Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and death, especially in developing countries. The effectiveness of conventional antimalarial drugs is waning and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. An understanding of malaria parasite biology should facilitate the development of effective therapies that prevent and/or treat malaria. The present studies explore the potential of vitamin A (retinol) as an antimalarial agent. Retinol may act by changing the oxidant milieu within the malaria parasite. Therefore, the nature and consequences of oxidant injury during malaria infection, and its treatment with retinol, have also been explored. The antimalarial potential of retinol was characterised using an established in vitro culture system allowing assessment of efficacy through [3H]-hypoxanthine uptake at different erythrocytic stages of development of Plasmodium falciparum. Retinol losses during culture were significant (&gt;50%). After adjusting for these losses, all parasite stages (early rings to mature trophozoites) showed similar retinol sensitivity, with values of the mean assayed concentration resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) ranging from 10.1 to 21.4 &#956;M. This range was above that in normal human serum (&lt;3 &#956;M) but below that associated with haemolysis in culture (&gt;43 &#956;M). Retinol pre-treatment of uninfected erythrocytes did not inhibit merozoite invasion. Retinol-treated parasites exhibited vacuolisation of the food vacuole and membrane rupture. A P. berghei murine model was used to determine the in vivo preventive and therapeutic efficacy of retinol. Multiple-dose retinol given to healthy Swiss mice before parasite inoculation reduced parasitaemia by 30%, a result comparable to the previously reported reduction in morbidity after vitamin A supplementation in children. A lesser reduction in parasitaemia of 10% was observed when retinol was given after the parasitaemia reached 10-15%. Retinol was ineffective in reducing parasitaemia when given either as single-dose supplementation post-inoculation or at regular intervals before and after infection. Retinol supplementation did not change plasma retinol concentrations during malaria infection whether or not retinol was given, but malaria attenuated the increase in liver retinol content. These data suggest that retinol has most value as prophylaxis. In contrast to published data from humans, previously healthy mice did not develop low plasma retinol concentrations during acute infection</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaria</field><field name="subject">Retinol</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and physical modelling of crack growth near free boundaries in compression</field><field name="creator">Pant, Sudeep Raj</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The fracture of brittle materials in uniaxial compression is a complex process with the development of cracks generated from initial defects. The fracture mechanism and pattern of crack growth can be altered considerably by the presence of a free surface. In proximity of a free surface, initially stable cracks that require an increase in the load to maintain the crack growth can become unstable such that the crack growth maintains itself without requiring further increase in the load. This leads to a sudden relief of accumulated energy and, in some cases, to catastrophic failures. In the cases of rock and rock mass fracturing, this mechanism manifests itself as skin rockbursts and borehole breakouts or as various non-catastrophic forms of failure, e.g. spalling. Hence, the study of crack-boundary interaction is important in further understanding of such failures especially for the purpose of applications to resource engineering. Two major factors control the effect of the free boundary: the distance from the crack and the boundary shape. Both these factors as well as the effect of the initial defect and the material structure are investigated in this thesis. Three types of boundary shapes - rectilinear, convex and concave - are considered. Two types of initial defects - a circular pore and inclined shear cracks are investigated in homogeneous casting resin, microheterogeneous cement mixes and specially fabricated granulate material. The preexisting defects are artificially introduced in the physical model by the method of inclusion and are found to successfully replicate the feature of pre-existing defects in terms of load-deformation response to the applied external load. It is observed that the possibility of crack growth and the onset of unstable crack growth are affected by the type of initial defect, inclination of the initial crack, the boundary shape and the location of the initial defect with respect to the boundary. The initial defects are located at either the centre or edge of the sample. The stresses required for the wing crack initiation and the onset of unstable crack growth is highest for the initial cracks inclined at 35&#176; to the compression axis, lowest at 45&#176; and subsequently increases towards 60&#176; for all the boundary shapes and crack locations. In the case of convex boundary, the stress of wing crack initiation and the stress of unstable crack growth are lower than for the case of rectilinear and concave boundary for all the crack inclinations and crack locations. The crack growth from a pre-existing crack in a sample with concave boundary is stable, requiring stress increase for each increment of crack growth. The stress of unstable crack growth for the crack situated at the edge of the boundary is lower than the crack located at the centre of the sample for all the crack inclinations and boundary shapes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Structural failures -- Simulation methods</field><field name="subject">Deformations (Mechanics) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Mathematical and physical modelling</field><field name="subject">Crack growth near free boundaries</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A green utopia : the legacy of Petra Kelly</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">[Truncated introduction] This thesis will introduce Petra Karin Kelly, former Green politician and campaigner for social justice and environmental issues to an English-speaking audience as an important figure in the development of ideas relating to ecofeminism, nonviolence, and Green politics and utopias. Kelly, born in 1947 in Germany, spent the latter half of her childhood in the United States, and attended university there before returning to Europe. While working with the European Community in Brussels, Kelly became involved in grassroots politics in Germany and was one of the co-founders of the German green party, Die Grunen, (literally: the Greens) in 1979. She was to become a formidable politician through her passion for grassroots politics, nonviolence and feminism and her excellent leadership skills. Later ostracised by the party, due in part to her inability and unwillingness to conform to party rules, Kelly worked independently, giving speeches and promoting peace and the importance of human rights. However, at the age of 44, she was murdered by her partner, Gert Bastian, who then shot himself. It should be noted that texts so far written on Petra Kelly have been essentially biographies, which, while encompassing much of her academic and political life, focus heavily upon her personal life, in particular her relationships with married men, and her long term relationship with former NATO General Gert Bastian ...  Therefore, the aim of the dissertation is not to ignore the importance of personal matters, rather to ensure a professional approach towards them. For this reason, the focus of this sociopolitical and sociohistorical thesis is upon the elements of ecofeminism, nonviolence and utopia as they relate to Petra Kelly&#8217;s politics, both within her role with Die Grunen and in her political life outside of German parliament.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kelly, Petra Karin, -- 1947-</field><field name="subject">Grunen (Political party)</field><field name="subject">Ecofeminism -- Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">Utopias -- Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">Germany (West) -- Politics and government -- 1945-1990</field><field name="subject">Green movement -- Germany (West)</field><field name="subject">Ecofeminist utopia</field><field name="subject">German Green politics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2005.0140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of technical trading rules, time-series trading rules and combined technical and time-series trading strategies in the Australian Stock Exchange</field><field name="creator">Loh, Elaine Y. L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines and compares the performance of three classes of stock trading strategies in the Australian stock market from 1980 to 2002. ... The first segment of this thesis examines some simple technical trading rules with a twostep methodology ... Our standard test results show that technical trading rules generate excess returns higher than that of the buy-and-hold portfolio equivalent prior to 1991, but generate lower returns in the period post-1991. Bootstrap test results also show that addressing nonnormality, time-dependence and conditional heteroskedasticity in the data reverses the standard test outcome of predictability ... In addition, our sub-sample results also show technical trading rules becoming less profitable over time ... The second segment of this thesis examines trading rules based on the forecasts of four time-series models: the AR(1), AR(1)-GARCH(1,1), AR(1)-GARCH(1,1)-M and AR(1)- EGARCH(1,1) models. These time-series trading rules were examined with standard t-tests and found to be significantly less profitable compared to technical trading rules. Subsample results also show the time-series trading rules losing profitability over time, which supports the conjecture that the Australian stock market became increasingly efficient over time. The third segment of this thesis examines trading strategies based on various combinations of technical trading rules and time-series models ... Due to the weak performance of the time-series trading rules, our results show that combining technical rules with time-series models do not lead to improved forecast accuracy. Sub-sample results again show a strong decline in profitability post-1991, suggesting that technological advancements in the ASX since 1991 enhance market efficiency such that the above simple stock trading strategies are no longer profitable.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stocks -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Speculation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis</field><field name="subject">Technical analysis</field><field name="subject">Bootstrapping</field><field name="subject">Trading strategies</field><field name="subject">Australian stock market</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The commandants : the leadership of the Natal native contingent in the Anglo-Zulu war</field><field name="creator">Smith, Keith I.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The senior Imperial officers who took part in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 are comparatively well known and their service in that brief period has been well documented, as indeed has that of many of their junior colleagues. Much less, however, is known about the officers who served as commandants of the Natal Native Contingent, although more than half of them were Imperial officers on special service duties. Most of the rest were British ex-officers who lived in South Africa, while one of the remaining two was an adventurer and mercenary. Many of them had already found service with the South African force during the Ninth Cape Border War against the Ngqika and Gcaleka which had only ended in mid-1878. According to official documents, the Natal Native Contingent initially numbered more than 8,000 native troops, in three regiments, under the command of European officers and non-commissioned officers. At the time of the invasion of Zululand in January, 1879, the contingent therefore made up about 62% of the invading force. This bald statistic, as so often, hides the true story. The thesis examines each of the commandants, and the extent to which their abilities and personalities were reflected in the performance of the native troops under their command, while at the same time revealing the evolution of the Contingent itself as an arm of the invading force under Lieutenant General Lord Chelmsford ... The haste with which the regiments were assembled, their often inhuman treatment by their officers, the minimal or non-existent training they received and the way they were armed and dressed all combined to qualify their subsequent performance in the field. A comparison of the NNC is drawn with the performances of the Native Mounted Contingent, and the men of Colonel, later Brigadier General, Evelyn Wood?s Irregulars. The conclusion of the thesis is that the commandants did indeed have a profound effect on the quality and performance of the Africans who served under them. In general, the units under serving British officers performed best, while the colonial officers did less well. The mercenary officer was almost certainly the worst, but by only a slim margin.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zulu War, 1879</field><field name="subject">Zulu War, 1879 -- Regimental histories</field><field name="subject">Great Britain. -- Army -- Colonial forces -- South Africa -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Anglo-Zulu War 1879</field><field name="subject">Commandants</field><field name="subject">Natal Native Contingent</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The alternative oxidase gene family in arabidopsis : insights from a transcriptomic study</field><field name="creator">Clifton, Rachel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mitochondria play an essential role in diverse metabolic pathways in plants. Their primary roles are the oxidation of organic acids via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP coupled to the transfer of electrons from reduced NAD+ to oxygen via the electron transport chain. Plant mitochondria also contain nonphosphorylating bypasses of the respiratory chain, catalysed by the alternative oxidase (AOX), type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (NDHs) and uncoupling proteins (UCPs). Each of these components bypasses energy conservation by either circumventing the formation or utilization of the electrochemical proton gradient, and each is encoded by a small gene family in Arabidopsis. It is proposed that the alterative pathways are likely to be involved in balancing cellular redox and energy status and in minimizing the production of ROS generated by over-reduction of basal respiratory chain components. Furthermore the alternative respiratory pathways are thought to play a role in plant responses to stress. In this study a transcriptomic approach was taken to investigate the role of the alternative respiratory pathways in Arabidopsis, with a focus on elucidating the role and regulation of the AOX gene family. Analysis of the expression of the five AOX genes in Arabidopsis over development and in a range of tissues revealed a unique spatiotemporal expression pattern for each gene. Expression profiling using quantitative RT-PCR, MPSS and microarrays detected an abundance of the AOX1a transcript throughout the plant and over development. The expression patterns of other AOX genes provide insight into their putative roles, AOX1b was expressed predominantly in the flower, AOX1d was particularly abundant in senescing leaves and AOX2 expression was only observed in the seed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plants -- Respiration</field><field name="subject">Plant mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis -- Respiration</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis -- Effect of stress on</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Alternative oxidase</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Alternative respiratory pathway</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of power ground planes</field><field name="creator">Trinkle, Joachim</field><field name="description">[Truncated introduction] A major contribution of this thesis is the observation that the N port impedance parameters for the distribution planes can be modelled as simple LC series elements in the frequency range over which the interesting interactions between the loading elements and the planes occur. Loosely speaking, the C represents the inter-plane capacitance and the L is associated with a first order frequency trend of the transfer and input impedances associated with the planes. In the literature, values for L have been obtained for power ground plane structures using curve fitting techniques [38]. In this thesis, formulae are developed for L based on the modal summation expression. As for the impedance case, the approach developed in the thesis that removes the singular behaviour, results in computational efficient expressions. Preliminary results on the simple LC model were presented by the author in [42, 43] The results reported in the thesis extend this work in the light of the new impedance model proposed. The simple LC characterisation enables the development of new low frequency expression for the input and transfer impedance for ports on planes loaded with many decoupling capacitors. The expressions are based on a one off frequency independent decomposition of the inductance matrix associated with the placement of the capacitors. The eigen-mode decomposition eliminates the need for matrix inversion at each frequency point and leads to an efficient computational procedure for calculating the impedance of loaded planes. Furthermore, the interaction between the capacitors and planes is clearly seen in the analytical expressions. This has led to new insights regarding the interaction of multiple capacitors with supply planes in terms of location, resonance mechanisms, pole locations and damping. These insights are beneficial to the understanding and optimisation of printed circuit board power distribution systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power distribution -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic compatibility -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Electric circuit analysis</field><field name="subject">Power ground planes</field><field name="subject">Power distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of geology, geomorphology, climate and vegetation, in controlling spatial and temporal changes in groundwater discharge from weathered crystalline basement aquifers in southwestern Australia</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, Jasmine Lee</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Collie River drainage basin is an important water resource catchment in southwestern Australia. Salinisation of a major water supply within the catchment, the Wellington Reservoir, has arisen due to changes in the water and salt balance in response to land clearing over saprolite aquifers. Paired catchment studies, the Collie Experimental Catchments (CECs), established in the early 1970&#8217;s in high and low rainfall areas increased our understanding of water and salt (predominantly chloride) movement in these aquifers through the collection and analysis of high resolution spatio-temporal data. However, the conceptual models developed from this work take little account of landscape heterogeneity, and this has caused problems in subsequent modelling studies, where success in calibrating stream flow has been countered by difficulties in predicting salt loads. The challenge remains to better describe variability in the Collie landscape and understand the influence of climate, vegetation, geology and geomorphology on observed water and salt fluxes. The release of salt from the lower saprolite aquifer and the role of the surficial aquifer in buffering groundwater discharge were investigated. The acquisition, analysis and interpretation of new regolith and geophysical data in 2001-2003 from the CECs, together with data from a high resolution digital elevation model, and existing drilling information, were used to construct a geologicalgeomorphological compartment framework, to observe changes in aquifer behaviour ...  Significant differences in the salt flux from compartments have been noted at a range of scales, with implications for both water resource and land management. The approach developed to identify compartments and assess their efficiency could be simplified, using catchment critical parameters determined from geological and geomorphological characteristics. As a consequence, the implementation of a compartment framework in catchments with saprolite aquifers should allow for more informed decisions to be made in the selection of sites for revegetation strategies or the development of engineering works. This is particularly important in the Collie Catchment where reclamation scenarios are currently being discussed. Consideration of the catchment as a compartmentalised system would help manage salt loads in the Collie River and return the Wellington Reservoir to a functional water resource.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Western Australia -- Collie Basin</field><field name="subject">Water salinization -- Western Australia -- Collie Basin</field><field name="subject">Aquifers -- Western Australia -- Collie Basin</field><field name="subject">Groundwater disposal in rivers, lakes, etc. -- Western Australia -- Collie Basin</field><field name="subject">Collie catchment</field><field name="subject">Saprolite aquifers</field><field name="subject">Salt yields</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of the Goldsmith Index of Body Symmetry to functional seated posture</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Emily Anne</field><field name="description">Whilst literature exists describing prevalence and theories about mechanisms of development of deformity, there is a distinct lack of research that examines how deformity can be measured despite it being an area of identified need. This study established the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the Goldsmith Index of Body Symmetry and examined the relevance of the information it provides within the context of a comprehensive postural assessment for individuals with cerebral palsy in conjunction with a commonly used clinical assessment ... Results demonstrated that high index levels were not exclusively associated with people with windswept deformity. Postural patterns of windsweeping, frog leg (abducting) and scissor (adducting) postures and hip extension were found to occur in all categories, suggesting that asymmetry is not confined to one particular postural pattern. Clinically observable changes were identified through comparison of the supine evaluation and index scores. The flexibility of postural components (or the ability to correct asymmetry) in a supine position for the SD categories demonstrated wide variation. However, subjects in the 3+SD groupings had fixed scoliosis and the majority (83%) also had fixed pelvic obliquity and rotation. All other subjects up to the 3SD category had flexible pelvic obliquity and rotation. No definitive differences in postural components between groups were identified in sitting positions, which was attributed to the influence of gravity on the body in an upright posture. Examination of sitting ability and index level did not demonstrate any relationship, suggesting that greater independence in sitting is not necessarily associated with a lower Goldsmith Index. The study highlighted that assessment of posture is complex, and that no single tool provides the answers required to manage a person&#8217;s posture. It demonstrates the need for clinicians to be aware that subjective clinical assessment may not be sufficient to adequately assess and detect changes in posture, and that the Goldsmith Index of Body Symmetry provides objective data that can be used as a powerful adjunct in interpreting clinical assessment and supporting the evaluation of clinical interventions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Symmetry (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Sitting position</field><field name="subject">Cerebral palsy -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Posture disorders -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Postural deformity</field><field name="subject">Windswept deformity</field><field name="subject">Goldsmith Index of Body Symmetry</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kidney form and function and the role of agrinine vasotocin (AVT) in three agamid lizards from different habitats in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ford, Stewart S.</field><field name="description">Reptiles are polyphyletic, and previous studies of renal anatomy and physiology in reptiles have covered a wide diversity of species of different phylogeny and habitat. To date, no study has examined the renal morphology and function of a group of closely related reptiles from different environments, yet this design has a number of advantages. Firstly, phylogenetic effects are reduced while adaptive specialisations in renal function or structure can be elucidated, and secondly, the variation in renal form and function between closely related species may be quantified in an effort to appreciate better the variation between more distantly related species. In this thesis, kidney morphology and renal function were studied in three Western Australian agamid lizards inhabiting environments differing in the availability of water. These key species were Pogona minor, Ctenophorus nuchalis and Ctenophorus salinarum. The renal anatomy of the three key lizards was characterised by determining glomerular diameter, volume density, surface area and number in each. Allometric relationships between kidney, colon and body mass were investigated in these and an additional 11 species of agamid lizard. Patterns of response to osmotic challenge were recorded by measuring renal variables such as urine flow rate, glomerular filtration rate and fractional reabsorption of filtrate among the three key species, and concurrent measurements of circulating arginine vasotocin in P. minor and C. nuchalis allowed the response of this hormone to homeostatic imbalance in these species to be gauged. The gross morphology and the glomerular characteristics of the kidneys was remarkably similar between species. Glomerular number and other characters varied as a function of body size rather than species, contrasting with reports in the literature suggesting that a given species has a particular number of glomeruli. ... Thus, kidney morphology is constrained among species and the response of each species to osmotic perturbation is similar. However, the mechanisms underlying antidiuresis and the hormonal control of this process differ subtly between species, and there is some evidence to suggest that P. minor is more adapted to a mesic environment than the other two lizards examined in this study. The hypothesis that renal form and function reflect the environment in which a lizard lives therefore receives partial support, although the reptilian bauplan is able to mitigate many of the forces that could potentially lead to renal specialisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arginine</field><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Western Australia -- Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Western Australia -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lizard kidney</field><field name="subject">Renal physiology</field><field name="subject">Renal morphology</field><field name="subject">Arginine vasotolin (AVT) in lizards</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The composition of the milk of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) and its consumption by the joey</field><field name="creator">Miller, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Previous studies suggest that the milk of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) could change composition coincident with critical stages of development of the young, and that the milk energy provided by the mother and its utilisation by the joey would determine the young&#8217;s growth rate. To test this general hypothesis, quokkas (n = 19) were bred in captivity and milk was collected during lactation. The samples were analysed using specific biochemical assays and sensitive analytical techniques to determine the composition of the milk of the quokka. The stable isotope, deuterium oxide, was employed to estimate the volume of milk consumed by the joeys. The adult females and their young were weighed and body measurements taken periodically, in order to calculate the body condition of the adults and monitor the growth rate of the offspring. Marsupial lactation can be divided in three phases. Phase 1 of lactation covers the period during pregnancy. Phase 2a of lactation in the quokka (0 to 70 days post partum), is the period when the young is permanently attached to the teat, while Phase 2b (70 to 180 days post partum) is when the joey suckles intermittently but is still confined to the pouch. Phase 3 of lactation extends from the time when the young initially emerges from the pouch to the end of lactation (180 to 300 days post partum) ... The metabolism of fatty acids in quokkas appears to be a combination of the processes in monogastric and ruminant mammals. The growth rate of the young quokkas was dependent on the volume and energy content of the milk consumed. The crude growth efficiency indicates that quokkas are equally efficient as other marsupials reported in the literature, in converting milk energy to body mass. It seems that female quokkas maintained energy balance during lactation, most probably by increasing their food intake rather than mobilising body fat stores. In addition, it appears that quokkas are capable of producing young of similar mass, irrespective of their own body weight or condition, when they have access to an adequate supply of food and water. This was the first study to provide detailed information about milk composition and lactational energetics in the quokka. While the results supported the unifying hypothesis in relation to the major changes associated with the transition through the phases of lactation, wide variations were detected between the quokka and other marsupial species in the changes in the detailed composition of milk and milk production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quokka -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Quokka -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Quokka -- Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Lactation</field><field name="subject">Milk -- Composition</field><field name="subject">Marsupial</field><field name="subject">Energetics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyrite weathering and lithium (Li?) transport under unsaturated flow conditions in model and mine-tailing systems</field><field name="creator">Alarcon Leon, Edgardo</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] As mineral deposits continue to be mined, the non economic gangue materials such as sulphides (e.g. pyrite) that are extracted as part of the ore body or overburden are deposited within the waste rock and/or milled tailings. As a result of natural weathering processes, these reactive materials represent a potential hazard to surrounding environments. A major consequence, resulting from mine-waste impoundments containing sulphidic materials, relates to the offsite movement of low pH leachates containing elevated concentrations of metal ions posing a contamination threat. The processes and mechanisms acting in the formation of acid mine drainage (AMD) are highly variable and, to a high extent, controlled by climatic conditions as the main driver of water flow and wetness of the system which in turn determines the availability of oxygen as well as water for pyrite weathering. In particular, this thesis is based on the hypothesis that in semiarid and arid climates the acid production may be water &#8230; The experiments were repeated at different water contents ranging from 0.24 to 0.33 cm3 cm-3. Breakthrough curves (BTC) of Li+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and pH were measured and described with models of different complexities. This included the use of a simple linear and non-linear isotherms for Li+ alone, a binary Li+ - K+ ion exchange, and a complete multicomponent chemical equilibrium description of ion transport. The latter, by including dissolution of primary minerals which released base cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ explained some of the elution patterns of base cations for which the Li+ - K+ exchange was the dominant process. Furthermore, under unsaturated water flow conditions, retardation of Li+ increased with decreasing water content. Thus solute mobility in mafic rock tailings appears to decrease under strongly unsaturated water flow conditions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">Sulphide minerals -- Oxidation -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Lithium -- Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Tailings (Metallurgy) -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Tailings (Metallurgy) -- Waste disposal</field><field name="subject">Tailings embankments -- Drainage systems</field><field name="subject">Acid mine drainage</field><field name="subject">Reactive transport</field><field name="subject">Tailings sand mixing</field><field name="subject">Li? transport</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of remotely sensed data to analyse spatial and temporal trends in vegetation patchiness within rehabilitated bauxite mines in the Darling Range, W.A.</field><field name="creator">Prananto, Agnes Kristina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The assessment of rehabilitation success is time consuming and costly for bauxite miners because large areas of land (~550 ha per year) are involved. In some cases, rehabilitation results in patches of bare or sparsely vegetated soil. This study uses remote sensing imagery to evaluate the growth of vegetation in rehabilitated bauxite mines in the Darling Range, W.A. This work has five aims, which are to (1) compare vegetation biomass within rehabilitated areas and nearby native forest; (2) analyse temporal changes in vegetation growth within the selected rehabilitated areas, in particular rehabilitated areas with patches of bare soil; (3) compare vegetation growth pre- and post- mining; (4) identify the best type of remotely sensed data for this particular study area, and (5) develop an index, which can classify the degree of vegetation patchiness within rehabilitated mine sites. This information will enable rehabilitation workers to identify patches in rehabilitated areas that may require further remediation. The study used RADARSAT, nine years of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps (extracted from LANDSAT TM multivariate imagery and Quickbird imagery) and aerial photographs to evaluate forty-seven ~1 ha study sites. Image and map analyses were conducted mainly using ESRI&#8217;s software ArcGIS 8.3 and ER Mapper 6.4. Ground truthing was carried out to confirm and recognise the causes of bare patches within the rehabilitated mine sites ... The results indicate that differences in rehabilitation management do not affect this index but the extent of bare patches does. Due to the sensitivity of radar imagery to surface roughness, rehabilitated areas cannot be distinguished from the native forest using radar images. A building (crusher) appears to be the same as mature vegetation. Knowledge of the features in an area is therefore crucial when utilising RADARSAT. The beam elevation angle and profile of the RADARSAT image used, made superimposition of radar and optical imageries impossible. Speckle noise in RADARSAT images made it impossible to detect relatively small bare patches. In addition, the many cloud free days in Western Australia make optical imaging possible so that the ability of radar imagery to penetrate cloud is redundant for this type of study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum mines and mining -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Darling Range</field><field name="subject">Abandoned mined lands reclamation -- Western Australia -- Darling Range</field><field name="subject">Revegetation -- Western Australia -- Darling Range -- Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Landscape changes -- Western Australia -- Darling Range -- Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Darling Range (W.A.) -- Remote-sensing images</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditional woven textiles : tradition and identity construction in the 'new state' of Brunei Darussalam</field><field name="creator">Haji Wahsalfelah, Siti Norkhalbi</field><field name="description">Since its independence in 1984, politicians and nationalists in Brunei Darussalam have appealed to traditions in their efforts to create a national identity based on Brunei Darussalam&#8217;s national philosophy, `Malay Islamic Monarchy&#8217;. Weaving is one of the traditions related to Brunei traditional culture, thus traditional textile is used to construct national identity. This study focuses on the role played by powerful institutions in the creation of new tradition in order to foster national awareness in the `new state&#8217; of Brunei Darussalam and I examine how traditional textiles are incorporated into the project of nation building. In Bruneian society, traditional woven cloths have multiple roles whose meanings vary according to the situation in which the traditional cloth is utilized. This research explores the significance of traditional textiles in Brunei Darussalam, focusing on the consumption of locally woven textiles in its traditions and the relationships to the expression and construction of identity. Since Islam came to Brunei Darussalam, it has become one of the predominant markers of identity of the Malays. This study analyse the influence of Islam in the production and consumption of traditional textile in Brunei Darussalam. The continuity of the production and consumption of traditional woven textile in Brunei Darussalam is very much dependent on its significant in the traditions of Brunei society as a whole. In order to prove this, this study focuses its investigation upon the production and uses of traditional textiles in the social customs of Malay society in Brunei Darussalam. Traditional woven textiles are employed to construct social identity in the reproduction of distinction. Traditional textiles are also offered to signify privilege and power. I examine how traditional textile is being used to distinguish social status and political prominence, denote offices, and display wealth and prestige.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile fabrics, Islamic -- Brunei</field><field name="subject">Nationalism and clothing -- Brunei</field><field name="subject">Nationalism and religion -- Brunei</field><field name="subject">Brunei -- Social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Willingness to buy from internet web sites : a suggested model</field><field name="creator">Chiam, Kah Min Michael</field><field name="description">The number of people shopping on the Internet has grown rapidly in recent years and it has been suggested that the growth rate of Internet transactions now exceeds that of traditional retailing. Despite the significant growth in the use of the Internet for business transactions, there is evidence to suggest that many customers abandon web sites without completing their transactions. It is clearly important to understand why people buy from the Internet and also the way consumers examine websites. There had been limited research undertaken to investigate the relationships between the various antecedents and the willingness to buy in the Internet environment, especially within a single study. The main trust of this research is to examine the antecedents that influence the willingness to buy from the Internet and also how these antecedents influence one another. The antecedents included in this research were brand image (Dodds, Monroe &amp; Grewal, 1991), perceived risk (Sweeney &amp; Soutar, 2001), trust (Lynch &amp; Beck, 2001), affect (Lynch &amp; Beck, 2001), convenience (Szymanski &amp; Hise, 2000), relative price (Sweeney, Soutar &amp; Johnson, 1999), site reputation (Baker, Grewal &amp; Parasuraman, 1994) and web design (Szymanski &amp; Hise, 2000). Some of the antecedents were found to be unsuitable and they were dropped from the study. The empirical results from the final model suggest that perceived value is positively influenced by affect and brand image. Both brand image and affect also positively influence the trust of the website. Willingness to buy from the website is influenced by perceived value and trust of the website.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teleshopping</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Shopping -- Computer network resources</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">Willingness to buy</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Perceived value</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Working memory for multifeature visuospatial stimuli in normal aging</field><field name="creator">Feldman, Christina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of the present series of studies was to identify barriers to working memory for multifeature visuospatial stimuli in normal aging. Memory for multifeature stimuli requires retention of multiple visuospatial features, as well as the relationships between features within stimuli, known as memory binding. In Experiment 1, younger people (17-25 years) and older people (66-95 years) completed a modification of Wheeler and Treisman&#8217;s (2002) visual change detection task, to determine the effects of normal aging on memory binding, and memory for multiple features ... Results indicated that older people did not have a memory binding decrement compared to younger people. Further, younger people performed more accurately when cued to attend to a specific feature, while older people&#8217;s performance did not improve with cueing ... Experiment 2 employed the binding condition and the &#8216;either&#8217; condition, with stimuli presented either sequentially or simultaneously. Results were consistent with Experiment 1, with no age-related binding decrement, regardless of the method of stimulus presentation. In Experiment 1, older people demonstrated a shape memory decrement compared to younger people. Experiments 3A and 3B were performed to determine whether this result did represent a memory decrement per se, or whether it was a consequence of a shape perception decrement ... Compared to younger people, older people demonstrated a similar performance decrement across shape perception and memory tasks, indicating that their performance was mediated by an underlying perceptual decrement. Experiment 4 was conducted to determine if older people had difficulty selectively attending to a feature across multifeature stimuli, as suggested by their failure to benefit from cueing in Experiment 1 ... Older people had a greater performance decrement when the irrelevant feature was incompatible with the correct response, compared to younger people, consistent with a selective attention decrement. Experiment 5B adapted the design of Experiment 4 to both a perception task and a working memory task, while Experiment 5A identified appropriate stimulus features to use in Experiment 5B ... Overall, older people do not have particular difficulty remembering multiple visuospatial features, or binding these features within working memory. Rather, older people&#8217;s performance was marked by difficulty selectively attending to a specified feature across multifeature stimuli.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory -- Age factors</field><field name="subject">Memory disorders in old age</field><field name="subject">Memory -- Ability testing</field><field name="subject">Working memory</field><field name="subject">Aging</field><field name="subject">Visuospatial</field><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanochemically synthesized nanomaterials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell membranes</field><field name="creator">Hos, James Pieter</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In this dissertation an investigation into the utility of mechanochemically synthesized nanopowders for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell components is reported. The results are presented in the following parts: the synthesis and characterisation of precursors for ceramic and cermet components for the fuel cell; the physical and electrical characterisation of the electrolyte and electrodes; and the fabrication, operation and analysis of the resulting fuel cells. Samarium-doped (20 mol%) ceria (SDC) nanopowder was fabricated by the solid-state mechanochemical reaction between SmCl3 with NaOH and Ce(OH)4 in 85 vol% dilution with NaCl. A milling time of 4 hours and heat treatment for 2 hours at 700&#176;C yielded a material with equivalent particle and crystallite sizes of 17 nm. The existence of a complete solid solution was affirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis. Doped-ceria compacts were sintered for 4 hours at 1350&#176;C forming ceramics of 88% theoretical density. The ionic conductivity in flowing air was 0.009 S/cm, superior to commercially supplied nanoscale SDC. Anode precursor composite NiO-SDC nanopowder was synthesized by milling Ni(OH)2 with the previously defined SDC formulation ... Anode-supported fuel cells were fabricated on a substrate of at least 500 'm 55wt%NiO-SDC with 17vol% graphite pore formers. Suspensions of SDC were deposited by aerosol on the sintered bilayer at a thickness around 5 'm. A cathode of 10% SDC  (SmSr)0.5CoO3 was deposited onto the sintered electrolyte and after firing had a thickness of around 25 'm. Operation of fuel cells in single-chamber mixtures of CH4 and air diluted in argon were successful and gave power outputs of 483 'W/cm2. Operation in undiluted 25 vol% CH4:air gave a power output of 5.5 mW/cm2. It was shown that a large polarisation resistance of 4.1 &#937;.cm2 existed and this was assigned to losses in the anode, namely mass transport limitation associated with the catalytic combustion of methane and insufficient porosity. The large surface area of Ni appeared to allow more methane to combust and hence prevented its electrochemical reaction from occurring, thus limiting the performance of the cell. The synthesis procedures, ceramic processing and fabrication techniques and testing methods are discussed and contribute significant understanding to the fields of ceramic science and fuel cell technology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solid oxide fuel cells</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Nanostructure materials</field><field name="subject">Mechanical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy of lycra arm splints : an international classification of functioning disability and health approach</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Catherine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis consists of five experimental studies from seven data collection periods.

Using a physically-based water balance approach the value of a plant based solution in redressing the hydrological imbalance that has become a feature of much of the dryland agricultural region of Western Australia is investigated. The effectiveness of lucerne in providing greater available storage for buffering large rainfall events, as compared to the annual systems, is illustrated. Continued transpiration following out-of-season rainfall events maintains a larger available storage capacity. In contrast, the annual systems that are fallow over summer only withdrew a small fraction of water by soil evaporation between rainfall events. Under annual systems, the profile moisture store was sequentially increased to the extent that additional increments of rainfall could potentially contribute to deep drainage. A particular focus of this study has been to investigate the presence of soil constraints to root growth, and to assess how these constraints affect the water balance. A site survey indicated the soil penetration resistance was sufficient to impose a physical constraint to root growth. Published literature on the site shows soil acidity is also at a level imposing chemical constraints to root growth. A root growth model &#8220;Rootmodel&#8221;, for predicting root growth with and without soil constraints is examined in detail as a method for providing root growth parameters for inclusion into the numerical water balance model, SWIM based on Richard&#8217;s equation. Functions developed from &#8220;Rootmodel&#8221; adequately describe the effect of profile limitations to root growth, such as soil strength, moisture availability and temperature. Recommendations are made for inclusion of a growth suppressing function in &#8220;rootmodel&#8221; based on the chemical limitation of low pH. The effects of soil acidity on the root growth of several species is investigated experimentally and the resultant root data provided a reference point by which the simplified prediction of root growth built into SWIM could be adjusted using a linear reduction function. A similar linear reduction function is also employed to impose a physical constraint in the form of high penetration resistance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water balance modelling</field><field name="subject">Lucerne</field><field name="subject">Subsoil constraints</field><field name="subject">Root growth</field><field name="subject">Water balance (Hydrology) -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Soil acidification -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Alfalfa -- Effect of soil acidity on -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Crops -- Effect of soil acidity on -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Crops and soils -- Western Australia -- Avon River Watershed</field><field name="subject">Avon River Watershed (W.A.)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compliance with international accounting standards by listed companies in the Gulf Co-operation Council member states : an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Al-Shammari, Bader A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate empirically the extent of mandatory compliance with international accounting standards (IASs) by companies in the Gulf Co-Operation Council (GCC) member states - namely, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - between 1996 and 2002, and to explain why some companies comply more than others. Official personnel in the relevant enforcement bodies were interviewed to obtain information about their monitoring and enforcement activities. An index of compliance was devised to quantify the level of compliance. This was applied to the financial statements of 137 listed companies. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to explore the relationships between the level of compliance and particular attributes of the companies and year-by-year dummy variables. This was done to discover if the level of compliance with IASs was influenced only by company attributes or whether there were time trends as well. The attributes were country of origin, size, leverage, liquidity, profitability, auditor, industry, internationality, ownership diffusion and the company&#8217;s age. The average level of compliance for all companies and all years was 75% of the items in the index. No company within the examined time period fully complied with all requirements. The average level of compliance increased over time, though, from 68% in 1996 to 82% in 2002. There was significant variation in the level of compliance across the six GCC member states as well, but the level of compliance increased in all states over the sample period. The highest average level of compliance was in Saudi Arabia, where it reached 88% in the last year of the study. The degree of non-compliance with IASs across the GCC member states was partially attributable to limited monitoring and enforcement by the bodies responsible for overseeing financial reporting, and to the limited comprehensiveness of audits by external auditors. In addition to the role of the enforcement bodies and external auditors, several company attributes helped explain the level of compliance with IASs. Compliance variation increased with a company&#8217;s size, leverage and internationality. The level of compliance varied by industry too; however, company profitability, liquidity, ownership diffusion and whether the audit was conducted by a major international audit firm were found not to be significant factors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gulf Cooperation Council -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Accounting -- Standards</field><field name="subject">Arab countries -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Financial statements -- Arab countries</field><field name="subject">Compliance</field><field name="subject">Enforcement</field><field name="subject">International accounting standards</field><field name="subject">Comapny attributes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfigurable cellular automata computing for complex systems on the SPACE machine</field><field name="creator">George, David Frederick James</field><field name="description">Many complex natural and man made systems are inherently concurrent in nature, consisting of many autonomous parts that interact with each other. Cellular automata allow the concurrency and interactions of these complex systems to be modelled. Using a reconfigurable a computing platform for running cellular automata models allows the natural concurrency of digital electronics to be directly exploited by the system being modelled. This thesis investigates methods and philosophies for developing cellular automata models on a reconfigurable computing platform, the SPACE machine. Modelling and verification techniques are developed using a process algebra, Circal. These techniques allow the desired behaviour of a system to be specified and simulated. The model is then translated into a digital design, which can be verified as correct against the behavioural model using the Circal system. Three cellular automata system are used to develop the methods and philosophies. The Game of Life is used to investigate how to model and implement CA on the SPACE machine. The Philosophies and techniques that are developed for the Game of Life are used in the following systems. More complex cellular automata models of road traffic are used to further develop the modelling techniques developed in the Game a Life. A user interface, which was created for viewing the outputs from the Game a Life, is extended to allow cellular automata cells to be dynamically placed and moved about on the computing surface, allowing the user to observe and modify experiment in real time. A cellular automata based cryptography system is then used to further enhance the techniques developed, and particularly to explore the area of producing dynamically reconfigured circuits as the inputs to the system change. The thesis concludes that there are many real life complex systems, such as road traffic simulation and cryptography, which require high performs systems to run on. The methods and philosophies developed in this thesis allow CA systems to be modelled using process algebra and run directly in digital hardware, allowing the natural concurrency of the hardware to be fully exploited.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adaptive computing systems</field><field name="subject">Reconfigurable computing</field><field name="subject">FPGHAs</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of green manure amendments on soil seed bank dynamics</field><field name="creator">Short, Nicolyn</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Weeds are a major limitation to agricultural and horticultural production and the main method of control is the use of herbicides. In addition to the resulting chemical pollution of the environment, the wide spread and continues use of herbicides have resulted in many weeds developing resistance to commonly used herbicides. This study investigated the potential of using green manures as a cultural method of control of weed invasion in agricultural fields. To understand the general mechanisms involved in the suppression of seed germination in green manure amended soils, seeds of crop species with little or no dormancy requirements were used in certain studies. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds were sown to a sandy soil amended with green manures of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), Brassica juncea, or oats (Avena sativa) to determine if the amendments affected seed germination and/or decay. It was hypothesised that the addition of plant material would increase the microbial activity of the soil thereby increasing seed decay, under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. Initial experiments used lettuce, cress and lupin seeds. Lettuce and cress are commonly used as standard test species for seed viability studies. Subsequent experiments used seeds of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum), silver grass (Vulpia bromoides), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) and wild oat (Avena fatua) as these weed species are commonly found throughout agricultural regions in Western Australia. Amending the soil with lupin or Brassica green manure was established as treatments capable of developing environments suppressive to seed germination. Lupin residues as green manure showed the strongest inhibition of seed germination and seed decay.

See PDF version for accurate reproduction]  In this thesis we investigate the properties of k-closures of certain finite permutation groups. Given a permutation group G on a finite set  &#937;, for k &#8805;  1, the k-closure G(k) of G is the largest subgroup of Sym(&#937;) with the same orbits as G on the set &#937;k of k-tuples from  &#937;. The first problem in this thesis is to study the 3-closures of affine permutation groups. In 1992, Praeger and Saxl showed if G is a finite primitive group and k &#8805;  2 then either G(k) and G have the same socle or (G(k),G) is known. In the case where the socle of G is an elementary abelian group, so that G is a primitive group of affine transformations of a finite vector space, the fact that G(k) has the same socle as G gives little information about the relative sizes of the two groups G and G(k). In this thesis we use Aschbacher&#8217;s Theorem for subgroups of finite general linear groups to show that, if G &#8804;  AGL(d, p) is an affine permutation group which is not 3-transitive, then for any point &#945; &#8712; &#937;, G&#945;  and (G(3) &#8745; AGL(d, p))&#945;  lie in the same Aschbacher class. Our results rely on a detailed analysis of the 2-closures of subgroups of general linear groups acting on non-zero vectors and are independent of the finite simple group classification. In addition, modifying the work of Praeger and Saxl in [47], we are able to give an explicit list of affine primitive permutation groups G for which G(3) is not affine. The second research problem is to give a partial positive answer to the so-called Polycirculant Conjecture, which states that every transitive 2-closed permutation group contains a semiregular element, that is, a permutation whose cycles all have the same length. This would imply that every vertex-transitive graph has a semiregular automorphism. In this thesis we make substantial progress on the Polycirculant Conjecture by proving that every vertex-transitive, locally-quasiprimitive graph has a semiregular automorphism. The main ingredient of the proof is the determination of all biquasiprimitive permutation groups with no semiregular elements.

It takes as axiomatic the argument that we need to rethink leadership in ways that are not irredeemably bound to ideals of instrumental rationality, hegemonic masculinity and competitive individualism but are, instead, informed by the &#8216;feminine&#8217; principles of mutuality, care and what Deborah Kerfoot (1999) terms &#8216;emotional intimacy&#8217;. I call this alternative construct &#8216;relational leading&#8217; in order to underline my position that leading is about connecting (in an authentic, empathic and ethical way) with others and across functions. This alternative understanding of leadership draws on Joyce Fletcher's (1999) model of a relational practice grounded in the &#8216;disappeared&#8217; feminine. While positing relational leading as a feminist alternative to dominant masculinist conceptions of leadership, this dissertation attempts to avoid reinvoking dualistic representations. It does this by thinking leadership as a practice undertaken by complex, embodied subjects whose capacity to creatively transcend binaries of masculine/feminine, reason/emotion, and power/powerlessness opens up possibilities for, in the words of Amanda Sinclair (1998), &#8216;doing leadership differently&#8217;. There is, however, a cautionary note in the recognition that identities and practices are discursively regulated or culturally patterned, so that men and women who &#8216;do&#8217; leadership face constant pressures to masculinise or feminise their identities. Such processes perpetuate both gender stereotypes and the privileging of a masculinised notion of leadership that Sinclair (1998) calls the heroic archetype. Nonetheless, the dissertation ends on an optimistic note, proposing reflexive practice as the agent of change and the condition for being/becoming a practitioner of relational leading, against the grain of masculine heroism and rational instrumentalism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Sex role in the work environment</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture</field><field name="subject">Leadership practice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atypical information processing in children with autism : links with inner speech deficit</field><field name="creator">Whitehouse, Andrew</field><field name="description">[Truncted abstract] A number of studies have provided evidence that individuals with autism have poor semantic processing of verbal information, instead gaining greater meaning from pictorial information. The aims of this thesis were, to firstly, investigate the verbal and pictorial encoding abilities of children with autism, and secondly, to determine the extent to which limitations in the use of inner speech may drive any encoding differences. The first study investigated the notion that children with autism have an atypical verbal processing style, showing poor semantic but enhanced phonological encoding of verbal stimuli. The experiment compared the performance of children with autism and ability-matched controls (N = 20 in each group) on a novel explicit verbal recall task that contained 20 word stimuli. Recall performance could be benefited through, in one condition, an understanding of the semantic links between the stimuli, and in another condition, an understanding of the phonological similarities between the stimuli. The design of the recall task controlled for the possibility that children with autism have poor retrieval strategies (by providing either a semantic or phonological retrieval cue) and hence maximized the likelihood that any between-groups differences in performance would be related to problems at the encoding stage. There was no difference between the two groups. Follow up comparisons revealed that the performance of the autism group was consistent with that of typically developing children of the same chronological age.  The idea that individuals with autism have increased facility for processing pictorial information (Kamio &amp; Toichi, 2000) was then investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autistic children -- Language</field><field name="subject">Human information processing in children</field><field name="subject">Verbal ability in children</field><field name="subject">Autism</field><field name="subject">Language</field><field name="subject">Inner speech</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutional versus retail traders : a comparison of their order flow and impact on trading on the Australian Stock Exchange</field><field name="creator">Wee, Marvin</field><field name="description">The objective of the thesis is to examine the trading behaviour and characteristics of retail and institutional traders on the Australian Stock Exchange. There are three aspects of these traders that are of particular interest to this study: (1) the information content of their trades, (2) their order placement strategies, and (3) the impact of their trading on share price volatility. Trades made on the basis of private information such as those by institutional traders are found to be associated with larger permanent price changes while trades by uninformed traders such as retail traders are found to be associated with smaller changes. In addition, institutional trades are found to have smaller total price effect compared to retail trades suggesting retail traders incur higher market impact costs. In order to profit from potentially short-lived information advantage, informed traders are expected to place more aggressive orders. The analysis of the order price aggressiveness showed institutions are more aggressive than other traders. In addition, retail traders are found to be less aware of the state of the market when placing aggressive orders. The analysis of the limit order book found significant differences between the contributions of institutional and retail traders to the depth of the limit-order book, with retail standing limit orders further from the market. This is consistent with the conjecture that uninformed traders such as retail traders have greater expected adverse selection costs. The effect of trading by retail and institutional traders on price volatility are also investigated. There is some evidence that retail traders are more active and institutional traders are proportionally less active after periods of high volatility. Also, the effect of the order activity from different trader types on volatility differs depending on the measure of order activity used.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stocks</field><field name="subject">Individual investors</field><field name="subject">Institutional investors</field><field name="subject">Retail traders</field><field name="subject">Order placement strategy</field><field name="subject">Institutional traders</field><field name="subject">Market volatility</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initial public offerings and board governance : an Australian study</field><field name="creator">Lin, Michelle Ching-Yi</field><field name="description">In March 2003, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) released new corporate governance guidelines, which included debatable &#8220;best practice&#8221; recommendations such as the adoption of an independent board and separation of the roles of chairperson and CEO. Given the premise that strong corporate governance enhances shareholder value and, by extension, increases initial public offering (IPO) issuers&#8217; appeal to investors, this thesis assesses the level of conformity by a sample of Australian firms, which made an IPO between 1994 and 1999, with the best practice recommendations. We also examine the relationship between firm outcomes (including IPO underpricing, post-IPO long-run performance, and the likelihood of a SEO) and board governance quality, captured by board composition, board leadership, board size and share ownership of directors. These outcomes are addressed as they are important dimensions of firm performance that may be reasonably assumed to be associated with the quality of corporate governance, and these tests can provide an insight into the preference of investors who arguably are best placed to assess the appropriateness of the recommendations promoted by the ASX. Further, we analyse changes in IPO firms&#8217; board structures from the time of listing to five years later to determine if IPO firms adopt governance structures that are more in line with the best practice recommendations after listing and if the changes are related to IPO firms&#8217; long-run performance. Overall, we find that IPO firms that arguably have the strongest incentive to adopt the &#8220;optimal&#8221; board structures diverge substantially from ASX&#8217;s recommendations both at the time of IPO and five years later. IPO firms&#8217; board structures are found to be unrelated with the level of IPO underpricing and board size, after controlling for the size of the firm, is significant in explaining both long-run aftermarket performance and the probability of a SEO. IPO firms with larger boards and those that increase the  board size after listing are found to perform better in the long-run. However, contrary to expectation, smaller boards are associated with a higher likelihood of equity reissuance. Overall, the results lead us to question the role played by the board of directors in signalling firm quality. Our findings also suggest that ASX&#8217;s best practice recommendations are likely to distort the market-driven practices already in place.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Going public (Securities) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Boards of directors -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis</field><field name="subject">Initial public offerings</field><field name="subject">Board of directors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfiguring space</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Paul</field><field name="description">The starting point of my dissertation is the question: What would be needed of a device to culturally reconfigure the way that we see? The question has been addressed through a theoretical examination of spatial theories in modern times and a creative exploration of new spatialities in new media technologies, both visual and aural. Central to my thesis are three claims: 1. the paradigmatic mathematical theory of single-point perspective is fundamental to the imagining and construction of space in modern times; 2. perspective is a seductive space because its virtualisations seem more authentic than phenomenological experience; 3. the structure of perspective space prefigures the computer screen, hence any attempt to reconfigure the spatial imaginary through the devices of new media technologies must first confront the historical ubiquity of perspective. The specific focus of my written research is a comparative study of Filippo Brunelleschi's perspective device and the virtual reality work of Char Davies. This comparative study focuses on the ingredients of both devices as well as the similarities between the environments in which they were demonstrated. Brunelleschi's Peephole device, according to his biographer Manetti, first demonstrated perspective theory in the early fifteenth century. Brunelleschi's device, with its three main components, the mirror, the burnished silver and the painted panel, are examined in regards to the environment it was demonstrated in. The dissertation explores these elements as the essential conceptual ingredients for the reconfiguration of space in modern times. Aspects of Brunelleschi's device are also examined creatively in my practical work. Today emergent technologies are being used to explore the potential of a new spatial world order. However, these new technologies are generally based on an Old World order perspective. Even the cubist reconfiguration of space did not change, in any fundamental way, the dominant perspectival model of perception because it did not have the same ideological and psychological power as perspective, which seduced the viewer into believing that the gap (or loss) between the technology and reality had been compensated. Arguably, the same claims can be made for virtual reality devices. Hence, important to the dissertation is a comparative study of Brunelleschi's perspective device and the virtual reality work of Char Davies. The creative work investigates the effects and work of perspectival spatiality by examining (through digital video, photographically and sonically) residual spaces in the environment. To me these residual spaces provide potential resistances to the perspectival space from which they evolved, and thus show new ways of exploring the virtual reality of cyberspace that, while acknowledging the pervasive presence of perspective systems, also deconstruct or even map new post-perspective spatialities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatialism (Art)</field><field name="subject">Space perception</field><field name="subject">Perspective</field><field name="subject">Virtual reality in art</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Brunelleschi, Filippo, -- 1377-1446 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Davies, Char -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of pharmacotherapies in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease</field><field name="creator">Veroni, Margherita</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background: This thesis examines pharmacotherapy use in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. It includes antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors, all shown in landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses to reduce the risk of cardiac events in patients with known coronary disease. Underuse of effective preventive therapies represents a lost opportunity to reduce mortality and morbidity. Overseas studies have shown significant underuse of effective therapies at the time of hospital discharge following an acute event and later in ambulatory care. Australian data on prescribing practices following an acute coronary event and, ongoing use in ambulatory care are sparse. Aims: The aim of this thesis was to quantify the prescription of known effective therapies at the time of hospital discharge following an acute coronary event and ongoing use in ambulatory care. A secondary aim was to identify barriers to optimal secondary prevention thus providing an evidential basis to recommend change. Methods: This was an observational study of a cohort of post-MI patients admitted to a tertiary and affiliate hospital in Perth, Western Australia. The continuum of care from the treatment plan at discharge through to the treatment regimen and risk factor management 12 months post-MI was examined. The intermediate step, communication about the treatment plan with the patient and the primary health care provider was also examined. The study involved a review of hospital medical records and follow-up questionnaires to patients and their general practitioners at 3 and 12 months post-MI. All post-myocardial patients were included in the analysis of prescriptions at discharge. The follow-up study included patients 80 years and younger with no terminal conditions. Patient interviews at 3 months and interviews and focus groups with key hospital staff provided qualitative data to inform the quantitative data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular agents</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Hospitals -- After care</field><field name="subject">Quality use of medicine</field><field name="subject">Secondary prevention</field><field name="subject">Continuity of care</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperament and milk quality in sheep and cattle</field><field name="creator">Sart, Sarula</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It is well known that cows produce more milk if they are comfortable at milking, because stress from milking may cause them milk ejection problems. Temperament is an intrinsic characteristic of the animals so may affect the level of comfort at milking, and stress from the milking process itself may have a greater impact on animals with nervous temperament than on those of nervous temperament. When the milking becomes a stressor, it may affect secretion of milk ejection hormones that, in turn, may affect milk yield and composition. There is little evidence for how animal temperament affects milk quality in different farm animals. In this thesis, I have examined the effects of temperament on quantity and quality of the milk from Merino ewes and Holstein cows. I also tested whether temperament affected the processing performance (clotting properties) of the milk from Merino ewes. The general hypotheses tested were: 1. Calm ewes would produce more milk of better quality than nervous ewes, and, consequently, the clotting properties would be better in the milk from calm ewes than from nervous ewes. 2. Calm cows would produce more milk of better quality than nervous cows.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk yield</field><field name="subject">Milk -- Quality</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Milk yield</field><field name="subject">Milk production and quantity</field><field name="subject">Sheep temperament</field><field name="subject">Cattle temperament</field><field name="subject">Cheese production</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the role of DNA methylation and PIK3CA mutations in human breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Li, Shao Ying</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Introduction: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, resulting in very different outcomes for women with apparently similar tumour characteristics. In order for patients to have optimal treatment, a better understanding of the molecular nature of their disease is required. Aims: The aims of this thesis were: 1) To determine whether methylation of RAR&#946;2, ER, CDH1, BRCA1, CCND2, p16 and TWIST genes are associated with phenotypic features of breast cancer and the prognostic significance of methylation of these genes. 2) To investigate for possible associations between the frequency of methylation at RAR&#946;2, CDH1, ER, BRCA1, CCND2, p16 and TWIST genes and the presence of germ-line variants in the TS, MTHFR, MS, CBS, MTHFD1 and DNMT3B genes, as well as for possible correlations between these polymorphisms and clincopathological features of breast cancer including patient outcome. 3) To determine whether PIK3CA mutations determined clinical phenotype and the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations in a large and well characterized cohort of breast cancer patients. Methods: A large and well characterized series of primary breast tumours were selected for methylation of RAR&#946;2, ER, CDH1, BRCA1, CCND2, p16 and TWIST genes using MSP, and for polymorphisms in TS, MTHFR, MS, CBS, MTHFD1 and DNMT3B genes using PCR, PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSCP. Mutations to PIK3CA were detected using F-SSCP. Results and Conclusions: Methylation frequencies ranged from 11% for CCND2 to 84% for ER. More frequent hypermethylation was observed in tumours with poor histological differentiation compared to those with well/moderate differentiation, as well as trends for association with larger tumour size and mutant TP53. Tumours with ER and CDH1 methylation were associated with significantly lower hormone receptor levels, younger age at diagnosis and the presence of mutant p53. TWIST methylation is firstly reported to be associated with significantly older patient age at diagnosis and larger tumour size. Our data suggests that gene methylation may be linked to various pathological features of breast cancer. However, there appears to be little support for a distinctive CpG island methylator phenotype in breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Tumors -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Tumors -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Carcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">Methylation</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation</field><field name="subject">PIK3CA mutation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical analysis of the structures established for the provision of Anglican schools in the diocese of Perth, Western Australia between 1917 and 1992</field><field name="creator">Melville, William Ian</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Within the State of Western Australia, from its early years, education has been provided not only by the State, but also by religious denominations, particularly the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and other Christian groups. This thesis is concerned with Anglican education in the State from the years 1917-92. The particular focus is on the structures established for the provision of Anglican education in the Diocese of Perth throughout the period. The central argument of the thesis is as follows. During the period 1917-92, the structures established for the provision of Anglican education in the Diocese of Perth changed across four subperiods: 1917-50, 1951-60, 1961-80 and 1981-92. During the first subperiod, provision was made under structures which allow for the schools which existed to be classified according to three &#8216;types&#8217;: &#8216;religious-order schools&#8217;, &#8216;parish schools&#8217;, and &#8216;schools of the Council for Church of England Schools&#8217;. The first two types continued during the second subperiod and were joined by two new types, namely, &#8216;Perth Diocesan Trustees&#8217; schools&#8217; and &#8216;synod schools&#8217;, while &#8216;schools of the Council for Church of England Schools&#8217;ceased as a type. During the third subperiod &#8216;synod schools&#8217; continued as a type, but the other three types ceased to exist. At the same time, one new type emerged, namely, &#8216;schools of the Church of England Schools&#8217; Trust&#8217;. During the fourth subperiod there were also two types of schools within the Diocese, but the situation was not the same as in the previous subperiod because while &#8216;synod schools&#8217; continued as a type, &#8216;Perth Diocesan Trustees&#8217; schools&#8217; ceased to exist. Furthermore, a new type was established, namely &#8216;schools of the Anglican Schools Commission&#8217;. This two-type structure for provision which was established during the sub-period 1981-92, is still that which exists to the present day for the provision of Anglican education within the Diocese of Perth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anglican Schools Commission (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church of Australia -- Education -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Church schools -- Western Australia -- Perth -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Anglican schools</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prospects of Dorycnium species to increase water use in agricultural systems of southern Australia</field><field name="creator">Bell, Lindsay William</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Dryland salinity is a major environmental challenge facing agriculture in Australia. One option to manage dryland salinity is the use of perennial forages that increase water use of agricultural systems. However, the current array of perennial forages is limited. Forage species that satisfy the range of climatic and edaphic environments, and production systems, in southern Australia are needed (Chapter 1). In particular, low rainfall regions lack options other than lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) (Chapter 1). The Dorycnium genus (canary clovers) contains perennial species that might be useful forage plants for southern Australia. Dorycnium are sub-shrubs and their plant form differs from current perennial forages (Chapter 1). The aim of this project was to investigate some of the agronomic traits of several species of the genus Dorycnium to explore where they might be used in Australia and how they might be integrated into agricultural systems for management of dryland salinity. First, two desktop investigations assessed the potential adaptation and role of Dorycnium species in southern Australia: a review of the current literature on the agronomic characteristics of Dorycnium (Chapter 2) and an eco-geographical analysis to explore the ecology of Dorycnium species (Chapter 3). The agronomy of Dorycnium has been previously researched mainly in New Zealand, and although this provides some indications on where and how Dorycnium might be best used in Australia, this still requires testing in Australia. In particular, the aluminium tolerance of Dorycnium species indicates that they may be more suitable for acid soils than lucerne. Little ecological data was obtained for germplasm and herbarium collection sites of Dorycnium species. Climate comparisons between the native distribution of Dorycnium species in the Mediterranean basin and Australia, using spatial aridity data and CLIMEX climate match modelling, revealed that D. hirsutum and D. rectum might be suitably adapted to the temperate pasture regions of southern Australia. Suitable germplasm of D. pentaphyllum may also exist, but subsequent investigations in this project focussed on D. hirsutum and D. rectum.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forage plants -- Australia, Southern</field><field name="subject">Clover -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinity control -- Australia, Southern</field><field name="subject">Salt-tolerant crops as feed -- Australia, Southern</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of environmental conditions on the infection behaviour of Western Australian strains of Plasmopara viticola, causal agent of downy mildew in grapevines</field><field name="creator">Williams, Mia Gabrielle</field><field name="description">Downy mildew, caused by the biotrophic Oomycete Plasmopara viticola, is one of the most important diseases of grapevines world wide. It is particularly destructive in temperate viticultural regions that experience warm wet conditions during the vegetative growth of the vine (Wong et al., 2001). The disease is not normally a problem in mediterranean climates where the growing season tends to be hot and dry (Mullins et al., 1992; Sivasithamparam, 1993). Grape downy mildew is however a major disease in Australian viticulture (McLean et al., 1984; Magarey et al., 1991). Grape downy mildew was first reported in Europe in 1878 (Viennot-Bourgin, 1981). In Australia, it was recorded for the first time in 1917 at Rutherglen in Victoria (Vic) (de Castella, 1917). The first recorded outbreak of the disease in Western Australia (WA) occurred in 1997 in a small planting of vines in the far north of the state. In the subsequent year, it was detected in widespread commercial viticulture in the Swan Valley production area, near Perth (McKirdy et al., 1999). The pathogen has since been found in all grape growing regions of WA. Since its introduction into European vineyards in the 1880?s, P. viticola has become one of the world?s most investigated grapevine pathogens. Many aspects its basic biology however remain unknown (Wong et al., 2001). Due to the recent detection of P. viticola in WA, little is known of the nature of strains of the pathogen in the state and their response to local environmental conditions. Much of the research concerning the influence of environmental factors on the development of P. viticola has been conducted in Europe e.g. parts of France and Germany. Due to significant differences in climatic conditions and a shorter selection time on the pathogen in WA, much of the information described in European studies may not be directly applicable to the grape downy mildew disease situation in WA. The focus of this thesis was to examine epidemiological aspects of P. viticola in the mediterranean climate of WA. The environmental conditions that could favour the development of epidemics by strains of the pathogen that have been detected in the state were determined. The existence of P. viticola ecotypes and genetic variation among strains from WA and the Eastern states of Australia was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grapes -- Diseases and pests -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Downy mildew diseases -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Downy mildew diseases -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia --</field><field name="subject">Plasmopara viticola</field><field name="subject">Infection behaviour</field><field name="subject">Grape downy mildew</field><field name="subject">Downy mildew of grapevines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of different methods of employment for people with intellectual disabilities</field><field name="creator">Kober, Ralph Oliver</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background Performance measurement in the not-for-profit sector is extremely important in terms of measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations in achieving their goals.

Aim This thesis seeks to further the research into performance measurement in the notfor- profit sector by evaluating the effectiveness of different methods of employment (open employment and supported employment) for people with intellectual disabilities. The disability employment sector is selected as the sector in which to undertake this research, as there are hundreds of disability employment agencies across Australia, which either support people with intellectual disabilities in supported employment or place them into open employment; each of whom contracts directly with the Australian Commonwealth Government for the services they must provide in order to receive funding. Method The Eggleton (1991) performance measurement framework is used to justify the measurement of the effectiveness of the different methods of employment based on the job satisfaction and quality of life of individuals participating in each method of employment. Job satisfaction is measured using a refined version of the Barlow and Kirby (1991) job satisfaction questionnaire, while quality of life is measured using both a refined version of the Schalock and Keith (1993) quality of life questionnaire, and the original questionnaire. One hundred and seventeen people with intellectual disabilities, who were employed in either supported employment or open employment, are interviewed. Statistical analyses are conducted on the entire sample, and also on various sub-samples that control for differences between participants in open employment and supported employment in terms of the type of occupation performed, living environment, and functional work ability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with mental disabilities -- Employment -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Quality of work life</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">People with intellectual disabilities</field><field name="subject">Work life</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human papillomavirus and cervical cancer in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Brestovac, Brian</field><field name="description">[Abstract not available]</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papillomaviruses</field><field name="subject">Papillomavirus diseases</field><field name="subject">Cervix uteri -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Human papillomavirus in Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Cervical cancer  in Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical analysis of shallow circular foundations on sands</field><field name="creator">Yamamoto, Nobutaka</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a numerical investigation of shallow circular foundations resting on various types of soil, mainly siliceous and calcareous sands. An elasto-plastic constitutive model, namely the MIT-S1 model (Pestana, 1994), which can predict the rate independent behaviour of different types of soils ranging through uncemented sands, silts and clays, is used to simulating the compression, drained triaxial shear and shallow circular foundation responses. It is found that this model provides a reasonable fit to measured behaviour, particularly for highly compressible calcareous sands, because of the superior modelling of the volumetric compression. The features of the MIT-S1 model have been used to investigate the effects of density, stress level (or foundation size), inherent anisotropy and material type on the response of shallow foundations. It was found that the MIT-S1 model is able to distinguish responses on dilatant siliceous and compressible calcareous sands by relatively minor adjustment of the model parameters. Kinematic mechanisms extracted from finite element calculations show different deformation patterns typical for these sands, with a bulb of compressed material and punching shear for calcareous sand, and a classical rupture failure pattern accompanied by surface heave for siliceous sand. Moreover, it was observed that the classical failure pattern transforms gradually to a punching shear failure pattern as the foundation size increases. From this evidence, a dimensional transition between these failure mechanisms can be defined, referred to as the critical size. The critical size is also the limiting foundation size to apply conventional bearing capacity analyses. Alternative approaches are needed, focusing mainly on the soil compressibility, for shallow foundations greater than the critical size. Two approaches, 1-D compression and bearing modulus analyses, have been proposed for those foundation conditions. From the validations, the former is applicable for extremely large foundations, very loose soil conditions and highly compressible calcareous materials, while the latter is suitable for moderate levels of compressibility or foundation size. It is suggested that appropriate assessment of compression features is of great importance for shallow foundation analysis on sand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foundations</field><field name="subject">Soil-structure interaction -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Soil consolidation -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">Shallow foundations</field><field name="subject">Large scale foundations</field><field name="subject">Siliceous sand</field><field name="subject">Calcareous sand</field><field name="subject">MIT-S1 model</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective grazing by sheep to improve the control of weeds of crops</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Dean Timothy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] With the rapid development of multiple herbicide resistant weeds in crops, it is likely that an important role now exists for new grazing management strategies in farming systems to provide an integrated approach to weed management. In this thesis we examined the general hypothesis that sowing a legume of low preference by sheep relative to the target weeds of crops would improve the control of those weeds in a grazed pasture. To test this general hypothesis, legumes of low preference by Merino sheep were identified and a series of experiments conducted to determine the effect on pasture composition when these less preferred legumes were incorporated into a grazed pasture. We found a learned response that altered forage preference by sheep was important in determining the effectiveness of grazing to reduce seed set by weeds of crops. Investigations on this aspect of the grazing behaviour of sheep were a key part of this thesis. The short-term relative preference of Merino hoggets among 15 pasture legumes, 4 grain legumes and annual ryegrass was determined by offering adjacent monocultures of each of the forage genotypes to the sheep. The relative preference of the hoggets for each of the 20 forages was determined at three phases of plant growth from estimates of the amount of forage consumed. Sheep showed a low selective preference for Vetch (Vicia sativa L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus L.), lotus (Lotus ornithopodioides L.) and snail medic (Medicago scutellata L.) cvs. Kelson and Sava at the vegetative phase of plant growth. An indoor method was also developed to test the relative preference of sheep among forages growing in pots. Using this method chickpea and snail medic, but not biserrula, were found to have a low relative preference by sheep at the vegetative phase.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pastures -- Weed control</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Effect of grazing on</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Control</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Preference</field><field name="subject">Diet selection</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agency costs of free cash flow and the market for corporate control</field><field name="creator">Lin, Suzanne Ching-Fang</field><field name="description">[Truncated thesis] This thesis investigates the relevance of Jensen&#8217;s (1986) free cash flow theory to the market for corporate control in Australia. Jensen posits that firms generating cash in excess of that required to fund positive NPV projects face greater agency problems as the free cash flow exacerbates the conflict of interest between shareholders and managers. One implication from Jensen&#8217;s free cash flow theory is that firms with high levels of free cash flow are more likely to initiate takeovers that are value-decreasing. There are two practical issues in testing Jensen&#8217;s theory; first, constructing an appropriate proxy for free cash flow and secondly, identifying firms with free cash flow. These issues are addressed directly in the first of the two essays that comprise this thesis. The first essay develops and assesses the merits of four operational measures for free cash. One of them is a stock measure while the others are flow measures. The stock measure is included because previous studies have mostly used the stock measure of cash when identifying firms rich in free cash (henceforth, cash rich firms), despite that Jensen (1986) has made explicit reference to free cash flow. We test the validity of this approach by investigating whether stock measures of free cash coincide with flow measures. Our results reveal that the stock and flow measures of free cash give rise to quite different lists of cash rich firms. This is an important empirical contribution of the thesis. Given the lack of definitive criteria for deciding which operational measure of free cash flow is most appropriate, we identify multiple sets of free cash flow firms based on the different operational measures developed. For each operational definition, two methods are used to identify cash rich firms. The first method defines a firm as cash rich if its cash variable ranks in the tenth percentile. The second method defines firms as cash rich if their cash variable value is greater than one and a half standard deviations of the value predicted by a model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cash management</field><field name="subject">Cash flow</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="subject">Takeovers</field><field name="subject">Free cash flow</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tectonic evolution and volcanism of the Lower Wyloo Group, Ashburton Province, with timing implications for giant iron-ore deposits of the Hamersley Province, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Muller, Stefan G.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Banded iron formations of the ~27702405 Ma Hamersley Province of Western Australia were locally upgraded to high-grade hematite ore during the Early Palaeoproterozoic by a combination of hypogene and supergene processes after the initial rise of atmospheric oxygen. Ore genesis was associated with the stratigraphic break between Lower and Upper Wyloo Groups of the Ashburton Province, and has been variously linked to the Ophthalmian orogeny, late-orogenic extensional collapse, and anorogenic continental extension. Small spot PbPb dating of in situ baddeleyite by SHRIMP (sensitive highresolution ion-microprobe) has resolved the ages of two key suites of mafic intrusions constraining for the first time the tectonic evolution of the Ashburton Province and the age and setting of iron-ore formation. Mafic sills dated at 2208 &#177; 10 Ma were folded during the Ophthalmian orogeny and then cut by the unconformity at the base of the Lower Wyloo Group. A mafic dyke swarm that intrudes the Lower Wyloo Group and has close genetic relationship to iron ore is 2008 &#177; 16 Ma, slightly younger than a new syneruptive 2031 &#177; 6 Ma zircon age for the Lower Wyloo Group. These new ages constrain the Ophthalmian orogeny to the period &lt;2210 to &gt;2030 Ma, before Lower Wyloo Group extension, sedimentation, and flood-basalt volcanism. The ~2010 Ma dykes present a new maximum age for iron-ore genesis and deposition of the Upper Wyloo Group, thereby linking ore genesis to a ~21002000 Ma period of continental extension similarly recorded by Palaeoproterozoic terrains worldwide well after the initial oxidation of the atmosphere at ~2320 Ma. The Lower Wyloo Group contains, in ascending order, the fluvial to shallow-marine Beasley River Quartzite, the predominantly subaqueously emplaced Cheela Springs flood basalt and the Wooly Dolomite, a shelf-ramp carbonate succession. Field observations point to high subsidence of the sequence, rather than the mainly subaerial to shallow marine depositional environment-interpretation described by earlier workers. Abundant hydro-volcanic breccias, including hyaloclastite, peperite and fluidal-clast breccia all indicate quench-fragmentation processes caused by interaction of lava with water, and support the mainly subaqueous emplacement of the flood basalt which is also indicated by interlayered BIF-like chert/mudstones and below-wave-base turbiditic mass-flows.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historical geology -- Western Australia -- Ashburton</field><field name="subject">Morphotectonics -- Western Australia -- Ashburton</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Iron ores -- Geology -- Western Australia -- Hamersley</field><field name="subject">Baddeleyite SHRIMP-geochronology</field><field name="subject">Physical volcanology</field><field name="subject">Carbonate sequence stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">Precambrian tectonics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory ensheathing glia : an investigation of factors affecting responsiveness of these cells in vitro and in vivo</field><field name="creator">De Mello, Thalles R. B.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG) have been demonstrated to improve functional and anatomical outcomes after injury to the nervous system and are currently being trialled clinically. This thesis presents the investigation of two important issues in OEG biology. The first study (Chapter 2) investigates effects of different members of the neuregulin (NRG) family of molecules on the proliferation of OEG, as a means of quickly obtaining large numbers of cells for clinical or experimental use. We report that NRG-1&#946;, but not NRG- 2&#945; or NRG-3, has a significant proliferative effect. Furthermore, we report for the first time that use of different mitogens (forskolin and pituitary extract) commonly used to expand these cells in vitro, can have a significant effect on the responsiveness of OEG to added NRG in subsequent mitogenic assays. OEG grown initially with forskolin and pituitary extract exhibited increased basal proliferation rates in comparison to OEG originally expanded without these factors, and this increased rate of proliferation was sustained for at least 6 days following their withdrawal from the culture medium. We also report for the first time the expression pattern of ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors on p75-selected OEG, and investigate their contribution to the NRG mitogenic effect by the use of inhibitory ErbB antibodies. Our second study (Chapter 3) seeks to clarify the role of OEG in promoting myelination of central nervous system neurons. In this study we have investigated the myelinating ability of OEG derived from embryonic (EEG), postnatal (PEG) and adult tissue (AEG) both in vitro and in vivo. OEG selected by p75-immunopanning were co-cultured with dissociated cultures of TrkA-dependant embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. EEG, but not AEG or PEG, successfully myelinated DRG neurons in the presence of serum and/or ascorbate. AEG also failed to myelinate GDNF-dependant embryonic DRG cultures, and growth factor-independent adult DRG cultures. Transplantation of OEG into lysolecithin demyelinated spinal cord demonstrated distinct ultrastructural differences between transplants of OEG derived from animals of different ages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clearance of degraded myelin from the lesion site appears to be more effective when animals are transplanted with EEG rather than AEG or Schwann cell preparations. These results suggest that myelinating potential of OEG in vitro and behaviour of these cells following transplantation in vivo are developmentally regulated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nervous system -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Cell proliferation</field><field name="subject">Myelination</field><field name="subject">Olfactory ensheathing glia</field><field name="subject">Neuregulin</field><field name="subject">Myelin</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in nonlinear self-dual supersymmetric theories</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Shane A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract. Formulae and special characters can only be approximated.  See PDF version for accurate reproduction.] Theories of self-dual supersymmetric nonlinear electrodynamics are generalized to a curved superspace of 4D N = 1 supergravity, for both the old-minimal and the newminimal versions of N = 1 supergravity. We derive the self-duality equation, which has to be satisfied by the action functional of any U(1) duality invariant model of a massless vector multiplet, and show that such models are invariant under a superfield Legendre transformation. We construct a family of self-dual nonlinear models, which includes a minimal curved superspace extension of the N = 1 supersymmetric Born- Infeld action. The supercurrent and supertrace of such models are explicitly derived and proved to be duality invariant. The requirement of nonlinear self-duality turns out to yield nontrivial couplings of the vector multiplet to K&#228;hler sigma models. We explicitly construct such couplings in the case when the matter chiral multiplets are inert under the duality rotations, and more specifically to the dilaton-axion chiral multiplet when the group of duality rotations is enhanced to SL(2,R). The component structure of the nonlinear dynamical systems introduced proves to be more complicated, especially in the presence of supergravity, as compared with well-studied effective supersymmetric theories containing at most two derivatives (including nonlinear K&#228;hler sigma-models). As a result, when deriving their canonically normalized component actions, the traditional approach becomes impractical and cumbersome. We find it more efficient to follow the Kugo-Uehara scheme which consists of (i) extending the superfield theory to a super-Weyl invariant system; and then (ii) applying a plain component reduction along with imposing a suitable super-Weyl gauge condition. This scheme is implemented in order to derive the bosonic action of the SL(2,R) duality invariant coupling to the dilaton-axion chiral multiplet and a K&#228;hler sigma-model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supergravity</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic theory</field><field name="subject">Electrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Fermions</field><field name="subject">Supersymmetry</field><field name="subject">Supersymmetry and duality</field><field name="subject">Supergravity models</field><field name="subject">Superspace methods</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of irrigation systems, partial root zone drying irrigation and regulated deficit, on plant parasitic nematode populations in grapevine</field><field name="creator">Shin, Hae Soo</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Nematodes are known to significantly affect productivity of grapevines worldwide. Although major surveys have been carried out on nematodes infesting roots of grapevines elsewhere, only a preliminary survey has been carried out in Western Australia (W.A.). This study on the effect of irrigation systems on pathogenicity of nematodes on vines commenced with a survey of nematodes in two major grapegrowing regions of W.A. In this survey, soil samples were taken from 5 vineyards from Margaret River and 7 vineyards from Swan Valley regions of the state. Root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) was found to be the dominant genus in both major grape growing regions. Meloidogyne spp. occurred 76% and 75% of total soil sample in Margaret River and Swan Valley. The highest density of Meloidogyne spp. was 7 nematodes/g soil in Margaret River and 3.17 nematodes/g soil in Swan Valley. In both regions, other plant parasitic nematodes were recorded that included the root lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), dagger (Xiphinema spp.) and stubby (Trichodorus spp.) nematodes. Paratylenchus spp. were found in a few soil samples from Margaret River region, and Helicotylenchus spp. were found only in Swan Valley region, but was widespread. Some vineyards have established only resistant cultivars (Schartzman, Ramsey and 34 EM) resistant to nematodes. In these vineyards total nematode population was lower than most of other vineyards. However, in comparison of nematode numbers between cultivars, there were lower number of nematodes in some susceptible cultivars than in the resistant cultivars. Most common nematode taxa were Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus and Xiphinema in both regions. Root-knot and root lesion nematodes were the most widespread and economically important genera.

Historically dog, rat and mouse models of diabetic retinopathy have been studied but none of these exhibit the later changes of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Animals can be rendered diabetic by surgical pancreatectomy or the use of chemicals such as allozan or streptozotocin or by feeding of a high galactose diet. Alternatively, spontaneous rodent models of diabetes have been examined such as the BB rat, KK mouse or NOD mouse. However, in each case the retinal vascular changes observed are those of early nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy comprising at most saccular microaneurysms, increased thickness of the capillary basement membrane, acellular capillaries and pericyte ghosts. &#8230; Fluorecein angiography of this transgenic line clearly demonstrates the presence of leaky new vessels, by the appearance of leakage spots scattered throughout the retina from 1 month of age. These mice constitute a valuable model of diabetic retinopathy. Neovascularization in this animal model is induced by VEGF as in human diabetic retinopathy. The source of VEGF in human diabetic retinopathy is the ischemic inner retina. In this transgenic model the source of VEGF are the photoreceptor cells, which are situated just underneath the inner retina. The neovascularization is not dependent on a particular developmental stage and there is no spontaneous regression of new vessels.

The topics addressed in each chapter are distinct, but related, and the specific contributions to knowledge made by the different chapters are related to: (i) understanding more fully the nature of the demand for alcohol; (ii) explaining the relationship between reputation characteristics and consumers&#8217; willingness to pay for wine; (iii) estimating the rate of return to Australian wine; and (iv) using financial analysis to reveal the risk diversification benefits available by including wine in an investment portfolio. The details of each contribution are briefly outlined below. Chapter 2 discusses the nature of the demand for alcohol. The demand for alcoholic beverages is an area much studied, and there are numerous studies estimating the own-price elasticity of alcoholic beverages. A review of relevant published studies indicates reported: beer own-price elasticity estimates range from -.02 to -3.00, with a mean estimate value of -.46, and standard deviation of -.41 (n = 139); wine own-price elasticity estimates range from -.05 to -3.00, with a mean estimate value of -.72, and standard deviation of .53 (n = 140); and spirits own-price elasticity estimates range from -.01 to -2.18, with a mean estimate value of -.74, and standard deviation of .47 (n = 136). Chapter 2 contributes to understanding the demand for alcohol, not by adding yet another set of elasticity estimates to an already substantial literature, but by providing a framework through which all known own-price elasticity estimates can be understood. Specifically, a meta-regression framework is employed to study previously published own-price elasticity estimates. This framework allows the effect of model design attributes to be isolated, and the underlying trend in consumer responses to price changes to be identified.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wine as an investment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Drinking of alcoholic beverages -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Hedonic pricing</field><field name="subject">Alcohol own-price elasticity</field><field name="subject">Portfolio selection</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiprocessor scheduling in the presence of link contention delays</field><field name="creator">Macey, Benjamin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Parallel computing is recognised today as an important tool in the solution of a wide variety of computationally intensive problems, problems which were previously considered intractable. While it offers the promise of vastly increased performance, parallel computing introduces additional complexities which are not encountered with sequential processing. One of these is the scheduling problem, in which the individual tasks comprising a parallel program are scheduled onto the processors comprising the parallel architecture. The objective is to minimise execution time while still preserving the precedence relations between the tasks. Scheduling is of vital importance since a poor task schedule can undo any potential gains from the parallelism present in the application. Inappropriate scheduling can result in the hardware being used inefficiently, or worse, the program could run slower in parallel than on a single processor. The scheduling problem is one of the more difficult problems facing the parallel programmer. In fact, it is NP-complete in the general case. As a result, a large number of heuristic methods  with sub-optimal performance but polynomial, rather than exponential, time complexity  have been proposed. In order to simplify their algorithms, researchers have restricted the problem: by making assumptions concerning the parallel architecture or imposing limitations on the task graph representing the parallel program. The evolution of the task scheduling problem has involved the gradual relaxation of these restrictions. A major change occurred when the assumption of zero inter-processor communication costs was removed.

This thesis considers both dynamic and static mechanical loads. Dynamic load describes the time varying load on airways produced by oscillatory breathing movements. Static load is that present at a fixed lung volume ie. without breathing. In the intact lung static load principally comprises the pressure across the airway wall, that is transmural pressure (Ptm), and elastic after-load arising from distortion of airway and lung tissue by the narrowing airway. The experiments performed in this thesis were designed to answer several outstanding questions relating to how dynamic and static loads regulate airway narrowing. Dynamic load from breathing movements cyclically stretches ASM, which produces a number of physiological and cellular effects. For example in ASM strips a period of cyclical stretch reduces subsequent ASM contraction. However the response of the whole airway to dynamic load may differ from isolated ASM where non-muscle tissue also contributes. The first aim of this thesis was to characterise the response of the whole airway to dynamic load and determine whether the airway wall modifies the effects produced by ASM length cycling. Static after-loads restrict ASM shortening providing a limit to airway narrowing. Two primary sources of airway wall load include cartilage and the mucosal membrane which contribute to airway compliance. The relative importance of cartilage and mucosa to airway wall compliance and airway narrowing is unclear.  ... Results demonstrate that airway narrowing is restricted by Ptm but not by parenchymal elastic after-load. The major findings of this thesis are: (1) dynamic loads produced by breathing movements regulate airway responsiveness through cyclical airway expansion and elongation; (2) the reported effects of cyclical stretch on ASM contraction differs in situ 8 possibly due to modification by one or more biomechanical or physiological properties of the airway wall; (3) parenchymal elastic after-loads, previously thought to be important during bronchoconstriction, do not restrict airway narrowing. Given the absence of an effect of parenchymal elastic after-load on airway narrowing, the static mechanical load on ASM therefore comprises Ptm and airway wall stiffness, with important contributions from cartilage and mucosa depending on lung volume.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine) -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine) -- Muscles</field><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine) -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Airway narrowing</field><field name="subject">Mechanical load</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">La nouvelle Babel : langage, identite et morale dans les oevres de Emil Cioran, Milan Kundera et Andrei Makine</field><field name="creator">Rey, Catherine,</field><field name="description">The subject of this thesis is an examination of the acquisition in language of a new country for three Eastern European writers exiled in France.

Departure necessitates the abandonment of the mother tongue: for Cioran, Romanian; for Kundera, Czech; for Makine, Russian. For each of these three writers, studied in this thesis, the adoption of French as the language of literary expression was a decisive act. Geographically and spiritually he and his text are redefined. Separated from familiar landmarks, each finds a new terrain in the language of the creative text, a place, a private space, in which to express the realities of his new self. On the one hand this new paradigm is the expression of a rejection of a past and a tradition; on the other hand it is essential in the process of coming to self-understanding. For Cioran, Kundera and Makine the French language provides a foil to their own ruptured, fragmented, traumatised or guilt-ridden native identities.

The application of a generic title often invokes the expectation of its generic features its conventional and formal characteristics. Though the prelude is one of the oldest genres in the history of keyboard music, it has relatively few conventions, and hence, with the abandonment of its primary function the prefatory role in the nineteenth century, it has been considered an indeterminate genre. Rachmaninoff, however, asserted that a generic title should carry with it appropriate generic manifestations, which parallelled similar generic concepts in literature. This expectation of generic traits is like setting up a &#8216;generic contract&#8217;, offering an invitation to either conform or reform, and thus affecting its course of development. A survey of the prelude&#8217;s historical development points to six rather consistent generic conventional and formal characteristics: (i) tonality, (ii) pianistic/technical figuration, (iii) thematic treatment and formal structure, (iv) improvisatory style, (v) mood content, and (vi) brevity. Though these general characteristics may overlap with other genres, it is their collective characteristics that have contributed to the genre&#8217;s unique identity. These features form the basis for an exploration of the conformity to, or further evolution of, these characteristics in the preludes of the early twentieth century. From the substantial number of piano preludes composed in this period, selected sets, representative of the various stylistic manifestations of the period, are analysed in relation to the identified generic characteristics. The examination reveals that these preludes, though apparently diversified in style and outlook, exhibit affinity in one form or another to the generic characteristics. Each example exhibits different treatments of the generic characteristics reflective of twentieth-century developments, whilst retaining its generic identity. The prelude is thus an amalgamation of a tonal, technical and affective piece, which may be considered a combination of a tonal essay, a study/toccata, and a character piece; and collectively, a sequence of tonalities, a collection of pianistic technical studies, and a compendium of musical styles/genres in miniature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Piano music -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Piano music -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Piano prelude</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary production and nutrient dynamics in solar salt ponds</field><field name="creator">Segal, Richard Daniel</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.

The Shark Bay Salt solar ponds, at Useless Inlet in Western Australia, vary in salinity from that of seawater to four times seawater, over the pond sequence. Water column photosynthesis and biomass decreased markedly with increasing salinity along the pond sequence, while benthic productivity increased as cyanobacterial mats developed. Correspondingly, net productivity shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy in the water column and from heterotrophy to autotrophy in the benthos. Both shifts occurred at intermediate salinity in the pond sequence, where there was low production in both the water column and benthos. Within individual ponds, productivity, algal biomass and physico-chemical conditions were relatively constant over the year of study. Transitions between benthic and planktonic production along the pond sequence were driven mostly by direct responses to salinity stress, as well as the formation of a gypsum crust on the pond floors at higher salinity (&gt;120 g kg-1). This transition is similar to that which occurs in saline lakes undergoing anthropogenic salinisation and identifies critical salinities for the restoration of these lakes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salt industry and trade -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Solar ponds -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology</field><field name="subject">Solar salt ponds</field><field name="subject">Nutrient dynamics</field><field name="subject">Primary production</field><field name="subject">Benthic mats</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining the war / imagining the nation : British national identity and the postwar cinema, 1946-1957</field><field name="creator">McDiarmid, Tracy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Many historical accounts acknowledge the &#8216;reverberations&#8217; of the Second World War that are still with the British today, whether in terms of Britain&#8217;s relationships with Europe, the Commonwealth, or America; its myths of consensus politics and national unity; or its conceptions of national character. The term &#8216;reverberations&#8217;, however, implies a disruptive, unsettling influence whereas today&#8217;s popular accounts and public debates regarding national identity, more often than not concerned with &#8216;Englishness&#8217; as a category distinctive from &#8216;Britishness&#8217;, instead view the Second World War as a time when the nation knew what it was and had a clear understanding of the national values it embodied a time of stability and consensus. This thesis demonstrates that, in the postwar period, &#8216;British&#8217; was not a homogeneous political category, &#8216;Britishness&#8217; was not a uniformly adopted identity, and representations of the nation in popular cinema were not uncontested. British national identity in the postwar 1940s and 1950s was founded upon re-presentations of the war, and yet it was an identity transacted by class, gender, race and region.

Social welfare &#8212; the system of social security to protect the well-being of the weaker members of society  has received little attention in Indonesia, both from the state and from the scholarly community. The historical neglect of social welfare in Indonesia has begun to be addressed recently, with the Social Safety Net (SSN) initiative.

This thesis aims to assess how the SSN accommodated the needs and aspirations of poor women, particularly those who live in rural areas. The rural poor deserve attention because poverty in rural areas is widespread and often intractable, and because poverty in rural areas tends to be more invisible than in urban areas.

These benefits include a disease break and improved weed control for cereals and less dependence on nitrogenous fertilisers due to the leguminous nature of pea. Currently, field pea adoption in Australia is low because the crop is susceptible to the fungal disease `black spot&#8217; (Mycosphaerella pinodes) and has low stem strength and a lodged canopy. Black spot causes yield losses averaging 10-15% per year. Lodging results in difficult and costly harvesting, increased disease pressure and increased wind erosion from exposed soil surface when stems break at the basal nodes. This project aimed to address these problems through breeding, and through the application of quantitative genetics theory to a recurrent selection program. A quantitative measurement of relative stem strength was developed which could be used effectively in the field on single plants. Accurate laboratory measurements of stem strength were closely correlated with the field measure of compressed stem thickness in the basal node region. A diallel analysis of stem strength of the progeny of crosses among a range of pea lines with different values of compressed stem thickness concluded that the genetic control of stem strength was additive, with no maternal inheritance or dominance or epistasis effects.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peas -- Disease and pest resistance -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Peas -- Breeding</field><field name="subject">Peas -- Selection</field><field name="subject">Mycosphaerella -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">Recurrent selection</field><field name="subject">Stem strength</field><field name="subject">Field pea</field><field name="subject">Disease resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A distributed conceptual model for stream salinity generation processes : a systematic data-based approach</field><field name="creator">Bari, Mohammed A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] During the last fifty years mathematical models of catchment hydrology have been widely developed and used for hydrologic forecasting, design and water resources management. Most of these models need large numbers of parameters to represent the flow generation process. The model parameters are estimated through calibration techniques and often lead to &#8216;unrealistic&#8217; values due to structural error in the model formulations. This thesis presents a new strategy for developing catchment hydrology models for representing streamflow and salinity generation processes. The strategy seeks to &#8216;learn from data&#8217; in order to specify a conceptual framework that is appropriate for the particular space and time scale under consideration. Initially, the conceptual framework is developed by considering large space and time scales. The space and time scales are then progressively reduced and conceptual model complexity systematically increased until ultimately, an adequate simulation of daily streamflow and salinity is achieved. This strategy leads to identification of a few key physically meaningful parameters, most of which can be estimated a priori and with minimal or no calibration. Initially, the annual streamflow data from ten experimental catchments (control and cleared for agriculture) were analysed. The streamflow increased in two phases: (i) immediately after clearing due to reduced evapotranspiration, and (ii) through an increase in stream zone saturated area. The annual evapotranspiration losses from native vegetation and pasture, the &#8216;excess&#8217; water (resulting from reduced transpiration after land use change), runoff and deep storage were estimated by a simple water balance model. The model parameters are obtained a priori without calibration. The annual model was then elaborated by analysing the monthly rainfall-runoff, groundwater and soil moisture data from four experimental catchments. Ernies (control, fully forested) and Lemon (53% cleared) catchments are located in zone with a mean annual rainfall of 725 mm. Salmon (control, fully forested) and Wights (100% cleared) are located in zone with mean annual rainfall of 1125 mm. Groundwater levels rose and the stream zone saturated area increased significantly after clearing. From analysis of this data it was evident that at a monthly time step the conceptual model framework needed to include a systematic gain/loss to storage component in order to adequately describe the observed lags between peak monthly rainfall and runoff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Watersheds -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Collie River Watershed (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Hydrologic models -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Stream measurements -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Salinization -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Catchment hydrology</field><field name="subject">Land use change</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Downward approach</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiac and vascular adaptations to exercise training in elite athletes and obese adolescents</field><field name="creator">Naylor, Louise Haleh</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis concerns itself primarily with the impact of exercise training on cardiac and vascular adaptations in humans.

Whilst there exists a long tradition of echocardiographic assessment of cardiac dimensions and mass in both athletic and clinical populations, investigation of the impact of each of these &#8220;conditions&#8221; on cardiac diastolic function is novel, and has been facilitated by recent advances in the technical approach to diastolic function assessment in humans.

After complex data analysis from the output signal of the present detectors, astrophysical results begin to emerge with upper limits on gravitational wave sources. So far, however no direct detection has been announced. To increase the sensitivity of current detectors, a second generation of interferometers is planned which will make gravitational wave astronomy a reality within one decade. The advanced generation of interferometers will represent a substantial upgrade from current detectors. Especially, very high optical power will circulate in the arm cavities in order to reduce by one order of magnitude the shot noise limited sensitivity in high frequency. However, the theoretical shot noise limit will only be achieved after implementation of complex thermal lensing compensation schemes. Thermal lensing is direct consequence of the residual optical absorption inside the substrate and coating of the test masses and could have tragic consequences for the functionality of the interferometer. The Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy (ACIGA) in collaboration with LIGO will run a series of high optical power tests to understand the characteristics and effects of thermal lensing. During these tests, techniques to compensate thermal lensing will be experimented. This thesis mainly focused on the first high optical power test in Gingin, Australia. The first test will consist of a Fabry Perot cavity with the sapphire substrate of the input mirror inside the cavity. Due to the high optical circulating power a strong convergent thermal lens will appear in the input mirror substrate. Because of the presence of the thermal lens inside the cavity, the size of the cavity waist will be reduced and the cavity circulating power will decrease. Simulations using higher order mode expansion and FFT propagation code were completed to estimate ways to compensate strong thermal lensing for the Gingin first test. The term `strong thermal lensing? is used because the thermal lens focal length is comparable to the design focal length of the optical components. The expected performance of a fused silica compensation plate is presented and advantages and limits of this method are discussed. Experimental results on small scale actuators which can potentially compensate thermal lensing are detailed. The knowledge gained from these experiments was valuable to design the real scale compensation plate which was used in the first Gingin test. This test was carried at the end of 2005. The thermal lens due to 1 kW of optical power circulating in the sapphire substrate was successfully compensated using a fused silica plate. Yet, thermal lensing compensation may only be required for room temperature advanced interferometer. Indeed, we showed that cooling the interferometer mirror to cryogenic temperature can eliminate the thermal lensing problem and also substantially decrease the mirror thermal noise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gravitational waves</field><field name="subject">Interferometers</field><field name="subject">Thermal lensing</field><field name="subject">Gravitational wave detectors</field><field name="subject">AIGO</field><field name="subject">ACIGA</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a culturally sensitive program delivering cardiovascular health education to indigenous Australians, in South-West towns of Western Australia with lay educators as community role models</field><field name="creator">Owen, Julie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Indigenous Australians suffer cardiovascular disease (CVD) at a rate six times greater than the general population in Australia and while the incidence of CVD has been reduced dramatically amongst the majority of non-indigenous Australians and amongst Indigenous populations in other countries in the last 30 years, there has been little change in the figures for Aboriginal Australians, showing that heart health campaigns have little impact, for this group of people. Aims : The principal aims of this study were firstly, to determine and record the barriers to the development and delivery of CVD prevention programs amongst Indigenous Australians and secondly, to develop an alternative, effective and culturally sensitive method of delivering heart health messages.  Methods and results : The study was qualitative research undertaken in three South-West towns of Western Australia where the incidence of CVD was high amongst the Aboriginal community members. The use of semi-formal interviews, informal individual consultation, observation, and focus groups were methods implemented to obtain information. The first phase of the research was to identify the barriers which affected the Aboriginal Health Workers&#8217; ability to deliver specialist educational programs. Questionnaires and interviews with the Aboriginal Health Workers and other health professionals in the towns, and community focus groups were undertaken in this phase of the study. The second phase of the research was aimed at developing an alternative strategy for delivering heart health messages. The focus changed to adopt more traditional ways of passing on information in Indigenous communities. The idea of small gatherings of friends or family with a trusted community member presenting the health message was developed. The third phase of the research was to implement this new approach. Lay educators who had been identified within focus groups and by Aboriginal Health Workers were trained in each of the towns and a protocol involving discussions of health issues, viewing a video on CVD, produced by the National Heart Foundation, sharing in a &#8216;heart healthy&#8217; lunch and partaking in a &#8216;heart health&#8217; knowledge game which was developed specifically for the gatherings. Several of these gatherings were held in each of the towns and they became known as &#8216;HeartAware parties&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Western Australia -- South-West -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Health and hygiene -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Community health aides -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Health education -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal health workers</field><field name="subject">Health promotion</field><field name="subject">Lay educators</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement, modelling and potential clinical applications of spatial variations in magnetic resonance proton transverse relaxation rates in iron-loaded liver and heart tissue</field><field name="creator">Pontre, Beau</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.  Formulae and special characters in this field can only be approximated.  See PDF version for accurate reproduction.] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been developed over the past two and a half decades to enable non-invasive assessment of soft tissues in the human body. MRI provides images of the tissues in the body with intensities weighted by nuclear magnetic relaxation properties of the tissue. Recent advances have utilised MRI as a quantitative tool with the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates in tissues being accurately quantified. One clinical application of quantitative MRI has been in the quantification of body iron stores in the management of iron overload diseases. MR images also contain information about the spatial variations of relaxation rates, which could be clinically useful. In the quantification of liver iron concentrations, proton transverse relaxation rate (R2) maps have been used not only to quantify iron concentrations but also to visualise the spatial variations. The work in this thesis addresses the use of spatial information from proton transverse relaxation rate maps in clinical practice. The quantitative spatial information contained in these maps is analysed in two clinically important settings, namely the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis and the assessment of magnetic susceptibility artefacts in cardiac proton transverse relaxometry. Spatial distributions of liver R2 maps were quantified using texture measures based on grey-tone spatial dependence (GTSD) matrices. Some of these measures gave a statistically significant distinction between patients with minimal or no fibrosis and those with fibrosis or cirrhosis. Distinction of fibrosis using this technique was enhanced in subjects with iron overload diseases, suggesting that iron is required as a contrast agent for sufficient sensitivity of image texture to fibrosis. In subjects with low tissue iron concentrations, tissue hydration was observed to also have an influence on R2. In patients with end stage liver disease, a model combining tissue iron concentration and tissue hydration gave a better prediction of R2 than iron concentration alone. A model combining several of the texture measures was developed using logistic regression and was found to improve distinction of high-grade fibrosis from low-grade fibrosis. For the distinction of F0 and F1 fibrosis stages (as assessed by the METAVIR system) from F2 and above the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.75. As this model was developed using a cohort of subjects with varying pathologies, the performance of the model is expected to improve if only iron-loaded subjects are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Fibrosis -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Diseases -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Iron overload</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polarised electron studies of spin-dependent interactions in zinc and krypton atoms</field><field name="creator">Pravica, Luka</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract.] An apparatus has been built, tested and characterised with greatly increased precision and accuracy to enable spin-polarised electron impact explorations of angular momentum effects in atoms.

Dempster (1991) proposed that developmental changes in inhibitory processes underpin these changes in the development of intelligence. The evidence Dempster presented to support this thesis typically takes the form of noting changes in inhibitory performance that occur in the same time frame as changes in psychometric intelligence (Dempster, 1991, 1992, 1993; Dempster &amp; Corkill, 1999). He also provides correlational evidence from studies in which intelligence scores are correlated with various inhibitory measures. One problem with much of the evidence presented by Dempster is that it does not distinguish between developmental and individual differences in inhibition and/or intelligence. Developmental differences are differences in performance between children at different ages. Individual differences are differences in performance between children of the same age. The majority of evidence Dempster provides concerns individual differences in inhibition and the relationship of these differences to intelligence rather than the relationship of any developmental differences to intelligence. Anderson (1987) suggests that the processes underpinning these two types of differences are not necessarily the same. For example, individual differences may be related to speed of processing, while developmental differences may be related to changes in inhibitory ability. Therefore, a more accurate test of Dempster&#8217;s thesis is to assess whether developmental changes in inhibition are related to developmental changes in intelligence, rather than whether individual differences in inhibition are related to intelligence. This was the primary goal of this thesis. A secondary goal was to address whether or not any developmental changes seen were primarily due to changes in inhibition or could be accounted for by changes in speed of processing. Measures which utilise difference score reaction time (RT) measures as inhibitory indices such as the stroop task do not typically account for this potential confound. A number of researchers have addressed this problem of difference score measures and proposed alternative analytic techniques (Christ, White, Mandernach, &amp; Keys, 2001; Christ, White, Brunstrom, &amp; Abrams, 2003; Faust, Balota, Spieler &amp; Ferraro, 1999). Each inhibitory measure used in the current study will attempt to control for group and individual speed differences, either by utilising one of these alternative techniques or using regression analysis to identify the contribution of speed to the developmental shift in intelligence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inhibition in children</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Children -- Intelligence testing</field><field name="subject">Children -- Intelligence levels</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron transport through domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires</field><field name="creator">Falloon, Peter E.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In this dissertation we present a theoretical study of electron transport through domain walls, with a particular focus on conductance properties, in order to understand various transport measurements that have been carried out recently on ferromagnetic nanowires. The starting point for our work is a ballistic treatment of transport through the domain wall. In this case conduction electrons are generally only weakly reflected by the domain wall, and the principal effect is a mixing of transmitted electron spins between up and down states. For small spin-splitting of conductance electrons the latter can be characterized by an appropriate adiabaticity parameter. We then incorporate the effect of spin-dependent scattering in the regions adjacent to the domain wall through a circuit model based on a generalization of the two-resistor theory of Valet and Fert. Within this model we find that the domain wall gives rise to an enhancement of resistance similar to the giant magnetoresistance effect found in ferromagnetic multilayer systems. The effect is largest in the limit of an abrupt wall, for which there is complete mistracking of spin, and decreases with increasing wall width due to the reduction of spin mistracking. For reasonable physical parameter values we find order-of-magnitude agreement with recent experiments.  Going beyond the assumption of ballistic transport, we then consider the more realistic case of a domain wall subject to impurity scattering. A scattering matrix formalism is used to calculate conductance through a disordered region with either uniform magnetization or a domain wall. By combining either amplitudes or probabilities we are able to study both coherent and incoherent transport properties. The coherent case corresponds to elastic scattering by static defects, which is dominant at low temperatures, while the incoherent case provides a phenomenological description of the inelastic scattering present in real physical systems at room temperature.  It is found that scattering from impurities increases the amount of spin mistracking of electrons travelling through a domain wall. This leads, in the incoherent case, to a reduction of conductance through the domain wall as compared to a uniformly magnetized region. In the coherent case, on the other hand, a reduction of weak localization and spin-reversing reflection amplitudes combine to give a positive contribution to domain wall conductance, which can lead to an overall enhancement of conductance due to the domain wall in the diffusive regime. A reduction of universal conductance fluctuations is found in a coherent disordered domain wall, which can be attributed to a decorrelation between spin-mixing and spin-conserving scattering amplitudes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spintronics</field><field name="subject">Electron transport</field><field name="subject">Nanowires</field><field name="subject">Domain structure</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopic phenomena (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Ferromagnetism</field><field name="subject">Domain wall</field><field name="subject">Mesoscopic physics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adoption of conservation tillage : an application of duration analysis</field><field name="creator">D'Emden, Francis Herbert</field><field name="description">The global adoption and diffusion of conservation tillage has made considerable progress over the last 20 years. No-till and zero-tillage could be seen as representing the current technological end-point of the conservation tillage movement. This thesis uses descriptive statistics and both logit and duration regressions to analyse the influence of cross-sectional and time-dependent factors on the probability of no-till adoption by growers in Australia&#8217;s southern grain growing regions. Cross-section and time-series data on individual adoption decisions was gathered through interviews and employed in conjunction with generic time series data from various government agencies in a duration analysis modelling framework. Descriptive statistics suggest that weed management and herbicide resistance are important considerations for growers in their tillage decisions, predominantly due to the substitution of herbicides for the physical weed control provided by cultivation. Logit and duration regressions identify a number of significant factors influencing growers&#8217; adoption decisions. These include growers&#8217; perceptions of herbicide efficacy and sowing timeliness in no-till systems; the declining price of glyphosate relative to diesel; average annual rainfall and growers&#8217; proximity to other adopters and opportunities to observe the beneficial effects of no-till. The results suggest that research and development of integrated weed management practices that are compatible with no-till systems is highly important if no-till systems are to be sustained in Australia&#8217;s southern wheatbelt. Such research and development should acknowledge the high value which growers place on locally generated information and the channels used to acquire such information, namely local extension events and consulting services. This thesis shows how duration analysis, with its ability to take account of both cross sectional and time-varying factors, can provide a statistical modelling framework better suited to the study of adoption decisions than traditional cross sectional methods based on logit and tobit analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation tillage -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Conservation tillage -- Australia -- Decision making</field><field name="subject">Cropping systems -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Duration analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the scaled boundary finite element method</field><field name="creator">Vu, Thu Hang</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The scaled boundary finite element method is a novel computational method developed by Wolf and Song which reduces partial differential equations to a set of ordinary linear differential equations. The method, which is semi-analytical, is suitable for solving linear elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. The method has proved to be very efficient in solving various types of problems, including problems of potential flow and diffusion. The method out performs the finite element method when solving unbounded domain problems and problems involving stress singularities and discontinuities. The scaled boundary finite element method involves solution of a quadratic eigenproblem, the computational expense of which increases rapidly as the number of degrees of freedom increases. Consequently, to a greater extent than the finite element method, it is desirable to obtain solutions at a specified level of accuracy while using the minimum number of degrees of freedom necessary. In previous work, no systematic study had been performed so far into the use of elements of higher order, and no consideration made of p adaptivity. . .

The soils of southwestern Australia are ancient and highly weathered. Consequently, the availability of phosphorus in these soils is too low for cropping purposes, so the application of P is necessary to maintain productivity. When P is applied to soil, typically as soluble superphosphate, it tends to be transformed to increasingly less soluble forms over time. Sparingly soluble forms of soil P are relatively inaccessible to Triticum aestivum; however, many grain legumes have a higher P-acquisition efficiency, allowing them to access pools of soil P that T. aestivum cannot. The P-acquisition efficiency of some grain legumes has been attributed in part to their ability to release large quantities of carboxylates, coupled with the development of cluster roots for species such as Lupinus albus. There are a number of unexplained observations in terms of the P-acquisition efficiency of grain legume species and the way that those species respond to P fertilisation. This PhD project aimed to study carboxylate release from a range of crop species, and investigate its role in variation among species for acquisition of phosphorus from sparingly soluble forms (chapter 1). ... L. albus (chapter 5). There was considerable variation in P acquisition among accessions. The variation cannot be attributed to differences in carboxylate release, cluster-root development or whole root system rhizosphere extract pH as measured in this study. We hypothesise that the variation might be attributed to differences in the ratio of release of protons and other cations localised around cluster roots. In conclusion studies of carboxylate exudation and sparingly soluble forms should use more than a single form if the aim is to draw generalised conclusions on P-uptake efficiency from sparingly soluble forms. Comparative studies of a range of species are a useful tool for enhancing our understanding of root physiology. While the benefit of carboxylates for providing access to poorly soluble P has been demonstrated, questions remain as to potential other roles for carboxylates, particularly in species that do not form cluster roots. Variation in P uptake among accessions of L. albus is present, and more work on proton release and ion balance of root clusters is necessary to understand intraspecific variation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carboxylic acids</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Phosphorylation -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Crops -- Effect of phosphorus on -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Carboxylates</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus acquisition</field><field name="subject">Rhizosphere</field><field name="subject">Wheat</field><field name="subject">Canola</field><field name="subject">Lupins</field><field name="subject">Pulses</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of authigenic xenotime in Proterozoic sedimentary basins : petrography, age and geochemistry</field><field name="creator">Vallini, Daniela Alessandra</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The realization in 1999 that the authigenic phosphate, xenotime, could be used in geochronological studies to place age constraints on burial events that affected sedimentary basins has opened numerous opportunities for establishing timeframes for sedimentary basin analysis. Since then, the mineral has been used to place new and novel age constraints on diagenesis, metamorphism, and hydrothermal alteration and mineralization events. Whilst these studies were successful, they identified many complexities in xenotime growth and were restricted to specific areas or single basins: they do not convey, demonstrate or explore the immense variety of geological applications in which xenotime may provide unique geochronological constraints. This thesis explores the nature of authigenic xenotime, utilizing studies in three different Proterozoic sedimentary basins: two in Australia, southwestern Australia and the Northern Territory, and the third in the United States of America. The thesis includes a number of discrete studies demonstrating different aspects of xenotime growth, elucidated from detailed petrography, geochronology and geochemistry of authigenic xenotime. An integrated textural, geochemical and geochronological study of authigenic xenotime from the Mt Barren Group, SW Australia, establishes an absolute timescale on some of the many processes involved during the diagenesis of siliciclastic units. ...  positions and trends and broadly confirm the chemical discrimination criteria established for an Archaean basin. However, the Proterozoic data are shifted to lower Gd-Dy values and extend beyond the original field outlines, causing more overlap between fields intended to discriminate xenotimes of different origin. The plots were revised to encompass the new data. This study has significantly extended our knowledge of the nature of authigenic xenotime. It was found that xenotime may form in (meta)sediments in response to a large number of post-depositional processes, including early- and latediagenesis, (multiple) basinal hydrothermal events and low-grade metamorphism. A combination of detailed petrography and in situ geochronology provides the best avenue to decipher complex growth histories in xenotime. With further development, it is likely that xenotime geochemistry will also prove diagnostic of origin and can be incorporated into the interpretation of age data. The number of potential applications for xenotime geochronology has been expanded by this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geochronometry</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Sedimentary basins -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Sedimentary basins -- United States</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Authigenic xenotime geochronlogy</field><field name="subject">Marquette range supergroup</field><field name="subject">Birrindudu group</field><field name="subject">Mount barren group</field><field name="subject">Paleoproterozoic sedimentary basins</field><field name="subject">Dating diagenesis</field><field name="subject">Uranium mineralisation</field><field name="subject">Low-grade metamorphic events</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children as agents of peace : conflict transformation, peacebuilding and track two diplomacy amongst children in Israel/Palestine</field><field name="creator">Beinart, Liza</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  This thesis examines the potential for children to contribute to peacebuilding processes in societies experiencing protracted social conflict. Since the shifting nature of contemporary armed conflict has increased the involvement of civilians, the potential for purely government-brokered peacemaking initiatives to bring about a sustained end to conflict has weakened. As a consequence, effective and permanent cessation to conflict has a better chance of success if a policy of grass-roots peacebuilding is constructed in and around top-level peace agreements. Implementation of track two diplomatic initiatives, particularly using the process of conflict transformation through dialogue encounter, has the potential to encourage a fundamental shift in the perceptions held by opposing groups in conflict, and the eventual total transformation of the conflict itself. &#8230; Parallel cultural analyses of Palestinian and Israeli society reveal the role of culture and nationbuilding in protracted social conflict; the effect of these dynamics on the political socialisation of children from both sides; and the extent to which these dynamics produce children who are suitable for participation in peacebuilding initiatives. The dissertation then explores the programs of several key child-orientated peacebuilding organisations currently operating in the sphere of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

However, it is less clear whether it also leads to impairment in the preparation of movement. The current investigation first aims to further our understanding of motor preparation in people with PD. Two techniques are commonly used to assess motor preparation. These are the manipulation of response complexity and cueing response-related information in advance of the imperative signal. They were both incorporated into a motor task in which participants performed two-movement sequences on a response board. In Experiment 1, people with PD (comprising two groups  one on their anti-Parkinsonian medication, and the other following a delay in its normal administration) showed patterns in their motor performance that was similar to healthy age-matched adults. They showed lengthening in their reaction time (RT) with increased response complexity, indicating that the sequences were prepared before their initiation. In addition, both of the PD groups, as well as the healthy adult group, showed shorter RTs with valid cueing and longer RTs with invalid cueing relative to the neutral cue condition. In response to a part-invalid cue (with both valid and invalid information) all three groups had very similar RTs to that in the neutral cue condition. ...  in the third experiment, participants were first presented with a sequence to perform, and then, while initiating and executing that sequence, they were presented with a second sequence, providing either valid or invalid visual information about the twomovement sequence. It was expected that if invalid visual information evokes a stronger obligatory response in people with PD, then these participants would experience greater difficulties ignoring such information. This was not found to be the case. Rather the PD group showed a similar pattern of performance to the healthy adults. This indicates that they were able to ignore visual information when it was invalid and unhelpful, and so suggests that people with PD use external information strategically. The results presented in this thesis suggest that motor preparation is largely intact in people with PD. Motor preparation may, however, be incomplete under reduced visual information. Furthermore, while visual information may be particularly important to people with PD, it does not seem to evoke a stronger obligatory response than in healthy adults. Rather, people with PD seem to use external information strategically.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">Motor preparation</field><field name="subject">External information</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural systematics of complexes of lanthanoid picrates with unidentate O-donor ligands and other related arrays</field><field name="creator">Chan, Eric J.</field><field name="description">Structures as determined by single crystal X-ray methods for lanthanoid(III) compounds for series of simple homoleptic species with diverse ligands frequently display variations entailing a diminution in coordination number (&#8216;C.N.&#8217;), a consequence of the variation in the size of the atoms/ions due to the &#8216;lanthanoid contraction&#8217;. A change from C.N. nine to eight is common, clearly separating compounds of the light/&#8216;early&#8217; or heavy/&#8216;later&#8217; metal atoms. Earlier work on the complexes of the lanthanoid(III) picrates arose out of the exploration of simple reagents which might usefully exploit lanthanoid ion properties for purposes such as solvent extraction. They are also of potential synthetic utility because of their relatively high solubility in apolar solvents. This thesis encompasses a systematic structural study of hydrated lanthanoid picrate complexes (including those of yttrium) with a selection of dipolar aprotic solvent ligands, namely trimethylphosphate (&#8216;tmp&#8217;), dimethylsulfoxide (&#8216;dmso&#8217;), hexamethylphosphoramide (&#8216;hmpa&#8217;), N,N&#180;-dimethylacetamide (&#8216;dma&#8217;), N-methylpyrrolidinone (&#8216;nmp&#8217;) and octamethylpyrophosphoramide (&#8216;ompa&#8217;), all liquids at room temperature and all unidentate, with the exception of ompa which can be considered in some cases to behave as the equivalent of two unidentate ligands, in others as a chelate. Structures of adducts of these ligands with scandium picrate are also included in order to gain further insight into the coordination behavior of the totality of the group &#8216;3&#8217; transition metals, and, for similar reasons, a study of the structures of complexes of Eu(dipivaloylmethanide)3 with the same (solvent) ligands as a &#8216;baseline&#8217;. In the course of these studies, hydrolysis of the aprotic solvent trimethylphosphate was found to lead to novel adducts of the dimethylphosphate (&#8216;dmp&#8217;) ligand; the introduction of polycyclic aromatic nitrogen base ligand complexes resulted in further novel mixed ligand compounds, supplemented by a study of protonated base picrate salts. This work aims not only to establish structural &#8216;domains of existence&#8217; with a concomitant consideration of the associated stereochemistry for these related series of rare earth complexes, but, also, to enhance our understanding of metal ion solvation and the interactions of aromatic groups within these types of crystal structures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rare earth metals</field><field name="subject">Yttrium</field><field name="subject">Ligands</field><field name="subject">Crystal lattices</field><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Crystal structures</field><field name="subject">Lanthanoid</field><field name="subject">Complexes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agro-ecology of Malva parviflora (small-flowered mallow) in the Mediterranean-climatic agricultural region of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Michael, Pippa J.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Malva parviflora L. (small-flowered mallow) (Malvaceae) is a common weed of pastures and wastelands and its distribution has increased rapidly throughout Australia during the last decade. Control of M. parviflora with herbicides, such as glyphosate, is often unsatisfactory and changing farming practices, such as minimum tillage, have facilitated its spread. Yet there has been little research on M. parviflora in the past and many aspects of its biology and ecology are unknown. Hence, there exists a need to examine these aspects in order to investigate and develop suitable integrated weed management strategies. Weed identification is the first and probably the most important step in the management of weeds. Here it is shown that the weedy Malva species in Western Australian farming systems is M. parviflora, and not a morphologically similar Malva species or hybrid of two species. A common garden study of 24 populations collected across the agricultural region of south-west Western Australia revealed that since its introduction over 140 years ago M. parviflora has successfully adapted to a wide range of distinct environments. The species is able to thrive in areas that vary in annual rainfall from 315 to 496 mm, maximum average temperatures from 21.9 to 26.8oC and minimum average temperatures from 9 to 13.6oC. However, there was limited broad scale ecoclinal differentiation and low genetic variation within the common garden study with only length of time between sowing and flowering differing between populations. As the species was shown to possess a predominately inbreeding system, which typically would create ecotypes/ecoclines due to limited gene flow, it was suggested that seed dispersal by sheep is likely to have increased gene flow thus suppressing population differentiation. A considerable proportion of mature hardseeded M. parviflora can survive rumen digestion and mastication by sheep. ...   With origins thought to be in the Mediterranean region, it is not surprising that M. parviflora has thrived and prospered in south-west Western Australia. This thesis has determined several aspects that have enabled it to flourish in this Mediterranean-type environment and most of these attributes, including autogamous reproduction, ecoclinal/ecotypic formation, dormancy and asynchronous germination and rapid seed development, are commonly found in successful weeds world-wide.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malva parviflora -- Ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Malva parviflora -- Control -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Agro-ecology</field><field name="subject">Small-flowered mallow</field><field name="subject">Mediterranean climate</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparing linear and undulating periodisation for improving and maintaining muscular strength qualities in women</field><field name="creator">Kok, Lian-Yee</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Resistance training is increasingly popular for improving strength qualities such as hypertrophy, maximal strength, endurance and power. Although many resistancetraining programmes now adhere to the concept of periodisation, the number of studies examining its structure and design are few, and there are just a handful of studies that have examined periodised training for the maintenance of strength and power. Even rarer, are periodised resistance-training studies that utilise female subjects. Previous studies have compared non-periodised training regimens such as Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE), and the two main models of periodisation, Linear Periodisation (LP) and Undulating Periodisation (UP). Results are inconclusive as to whether the efficacy of the periodised training programmes were due to the manipulation of training variables such as volume and intensity, or that training programmes with higher doses of volume induced better training responses. However, to make effective comparisons between training programmes, the training volume or workload (total load lifted x total repetitions) and training intensity have to be equated between the groups under examination. While the intensities (percentage of one-repetition maximum, 1 RM) for improving strength qualities such as hypertrophy and maximal strength have general consensus among resistance-training practitioners, there exists disagreement over the intensity that should be used during the training of power. Thus, it is important to first identify the load for power training before comparisons can be made between LP and UP programmes using equal training volumes. ... The final study found that adhering to two UP maintenance training programmes with equalised volumes and intensities twice a week increased upper-body strength and maintained lower-body strength adequately across a 3-wk phase. The results from these studies support previous results that suggest training programmes with higher workloads and repetitions produce superior strength and power adaptations, and it is not specifically the variation of training volume and intensity within a periodised programme that improves strength qualities. Thus, both periodised programmes used in this thesis can be recommended for untrained and moderatelytrained women as both LP and UP were found to be similarly effective for increasing upper- and lower-body hypertrophy, strength and power.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isometric exercise</field><field name="subject">Periodization training</field><field name="subject">Muscle strength -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Weight training for women</field><field name="subject">Linear periodisation</field><field name="subject">Muscular strength</field><field name="subject">Undulating periodisation</field><field name="subject">Strength qualities</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucoregulatory responses to intermittent high-intensity exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus : insight into the risk of hypoglycaemia</field><field name="creator">Guelfi, Kym Janese</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Exercise is generally recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus since it is associated with numerous physiological and psychological benefits. However, participation in exercise can also increase the risk of experiencing severe hypoglycaemia both during exercise and recovery. Unfortunately, existing guidelines to minimise the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycaemia are often general and fail to take into account that different precautions are required for exercise of varying type, duration and intensity. Specifically, there are no evidence-based guidelines for safe participation in intermittent high-intensity exercise (IHE), which characterises the activity patterns of most team and field sports, manual labour occupations and spontaneous play in children. This is because the response of blood glucose levels to this type of exercise is not known. Consequently, the purpose of this thesis was to investigate the glucoregulatory responses to IHE that replicates the high-intensity work-to-recovery ratios observed in intermittent sports in individuals with type 1 diabetes, in order to assess the associated risk of hypoglycaemia. The first study of this thesis examined the effect of the repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise that characterise IHE compared to remaining inactive, on blood glucose and glucoregulatory hormone levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Eight healthy individuals with type 1 diabetes were tested on two separate occasions during which either a 20 minute rest (CON) or an IHE protocol designed to simulate the activity patterns of team sports was performed (repeated 4 second sprints every 2 minutes).  ...   During the second hour of recovery, Ra and Rd returned to baseline following MOD, but remained elevated after IHE. These changes in Ra and Rd were consistent with a lower glucose infusion rate (GIR) during early recovery from IHE and a higher GIR after 2 hours of recovery compared to MOD. In conclusion, the repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise associated with IHE stimulate a more rapid and greater increment in Ra during exercise and attenuate glucose Rd during early recovery. These findings assist in explaining, in part, the previous observation that the risk of hypoglycaemia might be lower during IHE and early recovery compared to MOD. Overall, the findings of this thesis have implications for current recommendations aimed at managing blood glucose levels during and after exercise to avoid hypoglycaemia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Hypoglycemia -- Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite reducible matrix algebras</field><field name="creator">Brown, Scott</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A matrix is said to be cyclic if its characteristic polynomial is equal to its minimal polynomial. Cyclic matrices play an important role in some algorithms for matrix group computation, such as the Cyclic Meataxe of Neumann and Praeger. In 1999, Wall and Fulman independently proved that the proportion of cyclic matrices in general linear groups over a finite field of fixed order q has limit [formula] as the dimension approaches infinity. First we study cyclic matrices in maximal reducible matrix groups, that is, the stabilisers in general linear groups of proper nontrivial subspaces. We modify Wall&#8217;s generating function approach to determine the limiting proportion of cyclic matrices in maximal reducible matrix groups, as the dimension of the underlying vector space increases while that of the invariant subspace remains fixed. This proportion is found to be [formula] note the change of the exponent of q in the leading term of the expansion. Moreover, we exhibit in each maximal reducible matrix group a family of noncyclic matrices whose proportion is [formula]. Maximal completely reducible matrix groups are the stabilisers in a general linear group of a nontrivial decomposition U1&#8853;U2 of the underlying vector space. We take a similar approach to determine the limiting proportion of cyclic matrices in maximal completely reducible matrix groups, as the dimension of the underlying vector space increases while the dimension of U1 remains fixed. This limiting proportion is [formula]. ... We prove that this proportion is[formula] provided the dimension of the fixed subspace is at least two and the size q of the field is at least three. This is also the limiting proportion as the dimension increases for separable matrices in maximal completely reducible matrix groups. We focus on algorithmic applications towards the end of the thesis. We develop modifications of the Cyclic Irreducibility Test - a Las Vegas algorithm designed to find the invariant subspace for a given maximal reducible matrix algebra, and a Monte Carlo algorithm which is given an arbitrary matrix algebra as input and returns an invariant subspace if one exists, a statement saying the algebra is irreducible, or a statement saying that the algebra is neither irreducible nor maximal reducible.

While this is clearly multifactorial, this thesis addresses the effects of maternal smoking as a major adverse, yet avoidable exposure in early life. I hypothesised that the well-documented increased susceptibility to infection in infants of smokers could indicate underlying effects on innate Toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated microbial responses which could in turn contribute to early immune dysregulation and increased risk of allergic disease. In addition to providing the first defence against microbes, TLR-mediated pathways modulate subsequent specific immune response and are of growing interest in the potential inhibition of inappropriate allergic responses. My initial interest in the potential immune effects of smoking in pregnancy was based on preliminary retrospective analyses of a previous cohort (presented in Chapter 3) which suggested possible effects on T cell cytokine responses to mitogens and allergens. Based on this, I recruited a new prospective pregnancy cohort (n=122) of smokers (n=60) and non-smokers (n=62) (as outlined in Chapter 4) to confirm this and test my novel hypothesis that maternal smoking may be affecting important innate (TLR-mediated) immune pathways. &#8230; Thus, these findings could indicate that smoking increases the early susceptibility to infection thereby increasing subsequent IgA responses. This is supported by observations that key neonatal TLR responses are attenuated in children who go onto develop wheezy illnesses and lower respiratory tract infections. Together, the study findings suggest that in addition to effects on lung growth, maternal smoking may also influence aspects of neonatal innate immune function that are now believed to play a critical role in microbial-driven postnatal immune development, highlighting that other environmental interactions are also highly relevant to the v</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pregnant women -- Tobacco use</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Effect of tobacco on</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Allergy in infants -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Innate immunity</field><field name="subject">Allergy</field><field name="subject">Cotinine</field><field name="subject">Maternal smoking</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial distribution and temporal shifts in the biology of Holothuria whitmaei Bell [Echinodermata: Holothuroidea], Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Shiell, Glenn Raymond</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Aspects of the biology of the commercial sea cucumber Holothuria whitmaei were investigated at Coral Bay, Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia.

H. whitmaei had distinct preferences for outer reef habitats, including the outer reef flat and reef slope. However, the distribution of H. whitmaei within these habitats was heterogeneous, or, aggregated within certain micro-habitat zones - predominantly at the leading edge of the reef flat, perpendicular to the prevailing current. Two potential biological advantages of this distribution were hypothesised: i), that species aggregation enhances prospects for gamete fertilisation, a process which may be impeded under typical densities, and ii), large deposits of detrital matter, an important food source for holothurians, may accumulate within these zones. ... A striking feature of the reproduction biology of this species was the potential for specimens to mature asynchronously. It was hypothesised that this phenomenon may be a reflection of isolated individuals located too far from conspecifics to receive pheromone signals; cues which are known to entrain synchronous gonad development in some holothurians. Hence, it was proposed that aggregations of H. whitmaei may be important to the maintenance of population recruitment, given that animals at the periphery of species concentrations may have relatively little chance of achieving fertilisation. ... Given that H. whitmaei were observed to maintain highly specific patterns of distribution, this may have significant ramifications for trophic level cascades in the outer reef zone, particularly where this species is present in higher densities (i.e. &gt;100 ind. ha-1). The findings of this study, apart from highlighting the spatial and temporal biological attributes which may facilitate feeding and reproductive success, also emphasised the importance of biological knowledge to the management of sea cucumber fisheries. The study highlighted the need for further research to ascertain both the importance of species aggregations to population recruitment, and of the actual densities required to achieve high rates of gamete fertilisation. Such knowledge may help ultimately to identify suitable habitats for inclusion in marine protected areas.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holothurians -- Ningaloo Marine Park (W.A.) -- Geographical distribution</field><field name="subject">Holothurians -- Ningaloo Marine Park (W.A.) -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Holothurians -- Behavior -- Ningaloo Marine Park (W.A.)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyberhistory</field><field name="creator">Falloon, Keith</field><field name="description">Cyberhistory is a thesis presented at The University of Western Australia for the Degree of Master of Science. Computer history is its prime field of focus. Cyberhistory pursues four key themes in computer history. These are, gender, the notion of the periphery, access and the role of the proselytiser. Cyberhistory argues that, gender issues are significant to computer history, culture ascribes gender to computing, and culture has driven computer development as much as technological progress. Cyberhistory identifies significant factors in the progress of computer technology in the 20th century. Cyberhistory finds that, innovation can occur on the periphery, access to computers can liberate and lead to progress, key proselytisers have impacted the development of computing and computing has become decentralised due to a need for greater access to the information machine. Cyberhistory traces a symbolic journey from the industrial periphery to the centres of computing development during WWII, then out to a marginal computer centre and into the personal space of the room. From the room, Cyberhistory connects into cyberspace. Cyberhistory finds that, despite its chaos, the Internet can act like a sanctuary for those seeking to bring imagination and creativity to computing.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australian Regional Computing Centre</field><field name="subject">Computers -- History</field><field name="subject">Computers -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Electronic digital computers</field><field name="subject">Computer hacking</field><field name="subject">Gender and computing</field><field name="subject">Cyberspace cyber</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neuregulin-3 intracellular domain is biologically active : molecular and functional characterisation of protein interactions</field><field name="creator">Tiao, Jim Yu-Hsiang</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Neuregulins (NRG&#8217;s) are pleiotropic growth factors that participate in a wide range of biological processes. The family of membrane-bound growth factors bind to and activate ErbB receptors on adjacent target cells, mediating multiple biological processes. NRG-1, NRG-2 and NRG-3 are all highly expressed in the nervous system, where it has been shown that NRG-1 is important for neuronal development, migration, synapse formation and glial cell proliferation. Little is known, however, on the specific roles of NRG-2 and NRG-3, although it is apparent that despite similar expression patterns and overlapping receptor specificity, NRG-2 and NRG-3 do not compensate for the loss of NRG-1 and mediate their own distinct activities. &#8230; Subcellular localisation experiments showed that this domain is important for trafficking of the fulllength protein to various intracellular compartments in an activity dependent manner. In addition, the ICD is required to elicit a cell death response in cultured cells and provoke an elevated &#945;-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) response in organotypic neuronal cultures following transient expression of NRG-3. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified 14-3-3&#950; and PICK1 as two proteins that interacte with the human NRG-3 ICD. These interactions were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, and were further characterised at a molecular level. This study demonstrates the ability of NRG-3 to mediate signal transduction through a biologically active ICD; a conclusion supported by identifying cytoplasmic proteins that interact with the ICD.

Thus the estimation of the schedule, particularly the effort parameter, is a central element of software engineering management. Regrettably, estimation methods are poorly used within the software industry and accuracy is lacking when compared with other engineering disciplines. There are many reasons for this. However, the need to predict project effort remains, particularly in situations of tendering for contracts. The broad objective of this research is the improvement of project control by means of better estimation. . . The error in the prediction of a project parameter is investigated as the result of the variation in two distinct (estimation and actual development) processes. Improvement depends upon the understanding, control and then reduction of that variation. A strategy for the systematic identification of the sources of greatest variation is developed - so that it may be reduced by appropriate software engineering practices. The key to the success of the approach is the statistical partitioning of the Mean Square Error (of the estimate) in order to identify the weakest area of project control. The concept is proven with a set of student projects, where the estimation error is significantly reduced. The conditions for its transfer to industry are discussed and a systematic reduction in error is demonstrated on five sets of commercial project data. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the linking of the approach to current estimation methods.

This work, probably written in the early 1670s, was not discovered until 1997, and not published until 2005. To date, no extended studies of the work have been published. It is my argument that Traherne develops an expansive and energetic poetic expressive of the theme of the &#8216;Cosmic Christ&#8217;  in which Christ is understood to be the source, the sustaining life, cohesive bond, and redemptive goal, of the universe, and his body to encompass all things. While the term &#8216;Cosmic Christ&#8217; is largely of 20th century origin, its application to Traherne is defended on the grounds that it describes not so much a modern theology, as an ancient theology rediscovered in the context of an expanding cosmology. Cosmic Christology lies, according to Joseph Sittler,&#8220;tightly enfolded in the Church&#8217;s innermost heart and memory,&#8221; and its unfolding in Traherne&#8217;s Kingdom of God is accomplished through the knitting together of an essentially Patristic and Pauline Christology with the discoveries and speculations of seventeenth century science: from the infinity of the universe to the workings of atoms. &#8230; The thesis concludes with a distillation of Traherne&#8217;s Christic poetic  The Word Incarnate. The terms put forward by Cosmic Christology are used to explicate Traherne&#8217;s intrepid poetic. In his most remarkable passages, Traherne employs language not only as a rhetorical tool at the service of theological reasoning, but to directly body forth his sense of Christ at the centre of world and self. He promises to &#8220;rend the Vail&#8221; and to reveal &#8220;the secrets of the most holy place.&#8221; Scorning more &#8220;Timorous Spirits,&#8221; he undertakes to communicate and &#8220;consider it all.&#8221;</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traherne, Thomas, -- d.1674.</field><field name="subject">Teilhard de Chardin, Pierre.</field><field name="subject">Jesus Christ -- History of doctrines -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Mysticism -- Church of England -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Kingdom of God -- History of doctrines -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Realized eschatology -- History of doctrines -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">English poetry -- Early modern, 1500-1700 -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">English prose literature -- Early modern, 1500-1700 -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Traherne, Thomas</field><field name="subject">Cosmic Christ</field><field name="subject">Christology-17th century</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Launching a thousand ships : the beauty of Helen of Troy in Isocrates</field><field name="creator">Ceccarelli, Serena</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis focuses on the significance of the beauty of Helen of Troy in the Encomium of Helen written by the fourth-century philosopher Isocrates. Previous traditions, and especially epic poetry and tragedy, had assessed Helen&#8217;s beauty and either blamed or excused her for causing the Trojan War. Isocrates moved beyond this dichotomy to create a new focus on her beauty as the ultimate source of all that made Greek culture distinctive. Modern scholarship, however, has been generally unsympathetic  we may almost say blind  to this projected beauty. The meaning of beauty in Isocrates&#8217; work has been overlooked by scholars in favor of its rhetorical structure. The work was criticized for its disjointed arrangement and lack of seriousness. The Helen has been interpreted as a reaction to contemporary rhetorical issues or as merely an educational manifesto. This thesis aims to identify and clarify the ideology underlying Isocrates&#8217; construction of Helen&#8217;s beauty in his encomium. &#8230; The Helen of Isocrates is also compared with the contemporary Platonic work Phaedrus, which explores beauty as a means of arriving at pure knowledge. In this case, comparisons are drawn thematically and reveal that while the two works share similar topics and aims regarding the notions of beauty, Isocrate&#8217;s aesthetic idea is much more practically grounded and intended to be of benefit to the entire society when compared to the more idealistic and individual Platonic notion. Finally, the reasons for Isocrates&#8217; choice of beauty as a major theme for the Helen are explored through a comparison of Helen&#8217;s beauty to that of Hellas  an equation which Isocrates deems important for the fourth-century society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isocrates.</field><field name="subject">Plato.</field><field name="subject">Helen of Troy (Greek mythology)</field><field name="subject">Feminine beauty (Aesthetics)</field><field name="subject">Beauty in the ancient world</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Merchants and mercantile culture in later medieval Italian and English literature</field><field name="creator">Mair, Olivia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The later medieval Western European economy was shaped by a marked increase in commerce and rapid urbanisation. The commercialisation of later medieval society is the background to this research, whose focus is the ways in which later medieval Italian and English literature registers and responds to the expanding marketplace and the rise of an urban mercantile class. What began as an investigation of the representation of merchants and business in a selection of this literature has become an attempt to address broader questions about the later medieval economy in relation to literary and artistic production. This study is therefore concerned not just with merchants and their activities in literature, but also the way economic developments are manifested in narrative. Issues such as the moral position and social function of the merchant are addressed, alongside bigger economic issues such as value and exchange in literature, and to some extent, the position of the writer and artist in a commercialised economy. The study is primarily literary, but it adopts a cross-disciplinary method, drawing on economic and social history, literary criticism, art history and sociology. It begins with an assessment of the broader socio-economic context, focusing on ecclesiastical and social responses to the growth of  &#8230; This chapter discusses the thirteenth-century Floris and Blauncheflur (c. 1250), and the late fourteenth-century Sir Amadace, Sir Launfal, Octavian and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in relation to the commercialised economy and with reference to late medieval thought concerning value, exchange and the role and function of merchants. Geoffrey Chaucer&#8217;s Canterbury Tales (c. 1380s) is the subject of the third and final chapter, &#8220;Narrative and Economics in Chaucer&#8217;s Canterbury Tales&#8221;. Chaucer treats commerce and merchants with a complexity very close to Boccaccio&#8217;s approach to commerce. Both writers are acutely aware of the corruption to which merchants are susceptible, and of the many accusations levelled at merchants and their activities, but they do not necessarily perpetuate them. Rather than discussing exclusively the tales that deal extensively with merchants and commerce, or that told by the Merchantpilgrim, this discussion of the Canterbury Tales focuses on the Knight&#8217;s Tale, the Man of Law&#8217;s Tale and the Shipman&#8217;s Tale and the way they relate to broader ideas about the exchange and the production of narrative in the Canterbury Tales as a whole.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English literature -- Middle English, 1100-1500 -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Italian literature -- 14th century -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Merchants in literature</field><field name="subject">Commerce in literature</field><field name="subject">Mercantile culture</field><field name="subject">Medieval trade</field><field name="subject">Boccaccio and Chaucer</field><field name="subject">Medieval Italian and English literature</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phytoplankton dynamics in a seasonal estuary</field><field name="creator">Chan, Terence</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Swan River is a highly seasonal estuary in the south-west of Western Australia. Salinity may vary from fresh to marine at various times throughout the estuary, depending mostly on the intensity of freshwater discharge. There are occasional problematic dinoflagellate blooms which have spurred investigation of the dynamics of the phytoplankton community. The objective of this research was to examine how phytoplankton biomass and species' successions are influenced by the multiple variables in the aquatic ecosystem, and, if possible, to determine the dominant factors ... Comparisons of phytoplankton nutrient limitation simulations with experimental observations from field bioassays require further investigation, but reinforce findings that nutrients may only limit phytoplankton biomass when there is a convergence of favourable hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions. The Swan River estuary has undergone substantial hydrological modifications from pre-European settlement. Land clearing has increased freshwater discharge up to 5- fold, while weirs and reservoirs for water supply have mitigated this increase and reduced the duration of discharge to the estuary. Nutrient loads have increased approximately 20-fold from pre-European levels. The individual and collective impacts of these hydrological changes on the Swan River estuary were examined using the hydrodynamic-ecological numerical model. The simulation results indicate that despite increased hydraulic flushing and reduced residence times, increases in nutrient loads are the dominant perturbation, producing increases in the frequency and biomass of blooms by both estuarine and freshwater phytoplankton. By comparison, changes in salinity associated with altered seasonal freshwater discharge have a limited impact on phytoplankton dynamics. Reductions of nutrient inputs into the Swan River estuary from its catchment will provide a long-term improvement in water quality but manipulations of freshwater discharge have the potential to provide a provisional short-term remediation measure allowing at least partial control of phytoplankton bloom potential and eutrophication.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algal blooms -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Phytoplankton populations -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Swan River Estuary (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Phytoplankton succession</field><field name="subject">Swan river</field><field name="subject">Seasonal estuary</field><field name="subject">Algal bloom</field><field name="subject">Phytoplankton</field><field name="subject">Numerical model</field><field name="subject">Ecological model</field><field name="subject">Physico-chemical model</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinematic joint measurements using radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and single-plane x-ray video fluoroscopy</field><field name="creator">Ioppolo, James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Measuring the kinematics of joints and implants following orthopaedic surgery is important since joint motion directly influences the functional outcome of the patient and the longevity of the implant. Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) has been used to assess the motion over time of various joints and implant designs following corrective orthopaedic and joint replacement surgery for more than 20 years in more than 10,000 patients around the world. While the use of RSA reduces the risk of implanting potentially inferior prostheses on a large scale, conventional methodological procedures are based on the acquisition of static, stereographic x-ray images that are not suitable for measuring skeletal kinematics in a dynamic manner. The purpose of this thesis was to design, validate and test a novel technique for dynamically assessing the skeletal motion of human subjects using RSA and single-plane digital x-ray video fluoroscopy. The validation procedure utilised two in-vitro phantom models of human joints capable of simulating normal kinematic motion. These phantom models were supplied with realistic spatial displacement protocols derived from cadaveric specimens. The spatial positions of a series of tantalum markers that were implanted in each skeletal segment were measured using RSA. Skeletal motion was determined in x-ray fluoroscopy images by minimising the difference between the markers measured and projected in the single image plane. Accuracy was determined in terms of bias and precision by analysing the deviation between the applied displacement protocol and measured pose estimates. ...   The RSA and low dose single-plane fluoroscopy technique developed, validated and tested in this thesis is capable of dynamically measuring the kinematics of any joint in the human body, following the implantation of small metallic markers in the surrounding bone during corrective orthopaedic surgery. The kinematics of joints with replacement prostheses, such as the total knee replacement (TKR), can be analysed in addition to the kinematics of joints without replacement prostheses, such as the sacroiliac joint. The technique may be used in the future on groups of human subjects enrolled in controlled trials that are designed to analyse the kinematics of the shoulder, spine, hip, knee, patella or ankle joints for the purposes of quantitatively comparing the kinematics of different prosthesis designs and various corrective orthopaedic procedures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Joints -- Range of motion -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Knee -- Range of motion -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Artificial knee -- Range of motion -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Radiostereometric analysis</field><field name="subject">Joint kinematics</field><field name="subject">Digital x-ray video fluoroscopy</field><field name="subject">Motion estimation</field><field name="subject">Joint implant assessment</field><field name="subject">Image analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular ecology of Dawson's burrowing bee Amegilla dawsoni (Hymenoptera: Anthophorini)</field><field name="creator">Beveridge, Maxine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In the last two decades, the use of microsatellites has revolutionized the study of ecology and evolution. Microsatellites, or short tandem repeats (STRs), are stretches of DNA repeats, 1 to 5 nucleotides long, where the number of repeats varies between individuals. They are co-dominant, highly variable, neutral markers, and are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. Microsatellite loci were isolated from Dawson&#8217;s burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni, a large, fast-flying solitary nesting bee endemic to the arid zone of Western Australia. Twelve polymorphic loci were found with an observed number of alleles ranging from two to 24 and observed heterozygosities between 0.17 and 0.85. These loci were used to examine two aspects of this bee&#8217;s molecular ecology; its population structure and mating system ... The molecular data were also used to show that the nesting female is the mother of all her offspring and that brood parasitism is unlikely in this species. The data indicate that females make daughters at the beginning of the season followed by large sons in the middle, and then small sons at the end. Females often place one brood cell directly above another. The distribution of sex and morph in these doublets follows a pattern with most containing a female on the bottom and a minor male on the top, followed by almost equal numbers of female on top of female and minor male on top of major male. This pattern is likely favoured by emergence patterns, with males emerging before females and minor males emerging before major males. I suggest that although minor males have low reproductive success, their production may nonetheless be beneficial in that minor males open up emergence tunnels for their larger and reproductively more valuable siblings. In addition, minor males may represent the &#8216;best of a bad job&#8217; provisioning tactic arising from changes in the costs to nesting females of gathering brood provisions over the course of the flight season. This thesis demonstrates that microsatellites can be used to answer many questions regarding the molecular ecology of a species from the behaviour of the bees on a population scale to the mating behaviour of individual bees and how they allocate resources for the next generation. Many other aspects of the bee&#8217;s ecology could also be examined now that suitable molecular markers exist.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amegilla -- Western Australia -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Amegilla -- Sexual behavior -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Microsatellites (Genetics)</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Bees</field><field name="subject">Microsatellites</field><field name="subject">Breeding systems</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of isolation and environmental heterogeneity on intraspecific variation in Calamoecia clitellata, a salt lake-inhabiting copepod</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, Ayesha L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study focussed on how isolation and environmental heterogeneity in salt lakes has influenced intraspecific variation in the calanoid copepod Calamoecia clitellata. Calamoecia clitellata relies on passive vectors for dispersal, and this, coupled with the insular nature of salt lakes, may promote genetic divergence at a molecular level. When contrasting environments are involved, genetic divergence may also occur at the life history level, possibly due to local adaptation. I examined the distribution of genetic variation among 14 populations in Western Australia using molecular genetic markers, and examined variation in life history traits among contrasting environments. To ascertain how isolation had influenced molecular genetic variation, I determined population genetic structure and used a phylogeographic approach to infer the impact of historical events.

With increasing demands to build fast vessels of lighter weight, shipbuilders are more concerned with noise and vibration problems in ships than ever. The objective of this thesis is to study the vibration response of coupled structures, in the hope that the study may shed some light in understanding the general features of ship vibration. An important feature characterizing the vibration in complex structures is the input mobility, as it describes the capacity of structures in accepting vibration energy from sources. The input mobilities of finite ribbed plate and plate/plate coupled structures are investigated analytically and experimentally in this study. It is shown that the input mobility of a finite ribbed plate is bounded by the input mobilities of the uncoupled plate and beam(s) that form the ribbed plate and is dependent upon the distance between the source location and the stiffened beam(s). Off-neutral axis loading on the beam (point force applied on the beam but away from the beam&#8217;s neutral axis) affects the input power, kinetic energy distribution in the component plates of the ribbed plate and energy flow into the plates from the beam under direct excitation ... solutions were then used to examine the validity of statistical energy analysis (SEA) in the prediction of vibration response of an L-shaped plate due to deterministic force excitations. It was found that SEA can be utilized to predict the frequency averaged vibration response and energy flow of L-shaped plates under deterministic force (moment) excitations providing that the source location is more than a quarter of wavelength away from the plate edges. Furthermore, a simple experimental method was developed in this study to evaluate the frequency dependent stiffness and damping of rubber mounts by impact test. Finally, analytical methods developed in this study were applied in the prediction of vibration response of a ship structure. It was found that input mobilities of ship hull structures due to machinery excitations are governed by the stiffness of the supporting structure to which the engine is mounted. Their frequency averaged values can be estimated from those of the mounting structure of finite or infinite extents. It was also shown that wave propagation in ship hull structures at low frequencies could be attenuated by irregularities imposed to the periodic locations of the ship frames. The vibration at higher frequencies could be controlled by modifications of the supporting structure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration (Marine engineering)</field><field name="subject">Plates (Engineering) -- Vibration</field><field name="subject">Input mobility</field><field name="subject">Finite ribbed plate</field><field name="subject">Periodic and irregular ribbed plate</field><field name="subject">Irregular ribbed plate</field><field name="subject">L-shape plate</field><field name="subject">Vibration localization</field><field name="subject">Rubber stiffness</field><field name="subject">Impact test</field><field name="subject">Ship structures</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving model structure and reducing parameter uncertainty in conceptual water balance models with the use of auxiliary data</field><field name="creator">Son, Kyongho</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The use of uncertainty analysis is gaining considerable attention in catchment hydrological modeling. In particular, the choice of an appropriate model structure, the identifiability of parameter values, and the reduction of model predictive uncertainty are deemed as essential elements of hydrological modelling. The chosen model structure must be parsimonious, and the parameters used must either be derivable from field measured data or inferred unambiguously from analysis of catchment response data. In this thesis, a long-term water balance model for the Susannah Brook catchment in Western Australia has been pursued using the ?downward approach?, which is a systematic approach to determine the model with the minimum level of complexity, with parameter values that in theory are derivable from existing physiographic data relating to the catchment. Through the analysis of the rainfall-runoff response at different timescales, and the exploration of the climate, soil and vegetation controls on the water balance response, an initial model structure was formulated, and a priori model parameter values estimated. Further investigation with the use of auxiliary data such as deuterium concentration in the stream and groundwater level data exposed inadequacies in the model structure. Two more model structures were then proposed and investigated through formulating alternative hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of observed variability, including those associated with the absence of a contribution of deep groundwater flow to the streamflow, which was indicated by deuterium concentration and internal dynamics characterized by the observed groundwater levels. ...  These differences are due to differences in the time delay between rainfall and recharge between upland and riparian regions. The ages of water recharging the groundwater and discharging from the catchment were estimated by assuming a piston flow mechanism. In the deeper, upland soils, the age of recharging water was considerably larger than the unsaturated zone delay would suggest; a recharge response 16 days after an infiltration event may involve water as much as 160 days old. On the other hand, the delay and the age of recharging water were much lower in the shallow riparian zone. Where the upland zone contributes significantly to discharge, the predicted difference between the rainfall-discharge response time and the average age of discharging water can be significant.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrologic models -- Western Australia -- Susannah Brook</field><field name="subject">Susannah Brook Watershed (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Predictive control</field><field name="subject">Downward approach</field><field name="subject">Auxiliary data</field><field name="subject">Reduction of uncertainty</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional aspects of optic nerve regeneration</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Andrew</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Formation and consolidation of the retinotectal projection during optic nerve regeneration has been associated with two major interlinked processes. Initially, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons are guided by molecular guidance cues, such as the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, the ephrins, to their approximately correct location and form a coarse topographic map in the optic tecum. Such axon guidance occurs in the absence of neural activity and is considered to be activity-independent. The second process involves glutamatergic excitation, whereby correctly located connections are strengthened by correlated neural activity, whilst removing inappropriately located ones thereby sharpening the topography.The second process is considered to be activitydependent. Here, a number of experiments were undertaken to further examine the interrelationships of activity-dependent and independent processes with respect to functional outcomes. Two models of optic nerve regeneration were studied. In goldfish, following optic nerve crush, regeneration is successful. &#8230; In goldfish, guidance along the medio-lateral tectal axis may occur through preordering of axons prior to entering the tectum via the appropriate medial and lateral brachium, with EphA/ephrin-A then guiding axons over the rostral-caudal axis establishing gross topography. The increase in involvement of NMDA-mediated transmission during the period of activity-dependent refinement consolidated the role of this receptor in synapse plasticity. However what triggers NMDA-mediated activity to increase is still largely unresolved, although as the factors governing receptor trafficking during development and synaptic plasticity become better understood, these can be applied to the period of plasticity associated with regenerating axons. And finally, as GABAergic inhibition appears to suppress activity-dependent refinement, means of overcoming this inhibition through 4 such methods as visual training or pharmacological intervention may have significance for mammalian regeneration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optic nerve -- Regeneration -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Goldfish -- Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Optic nerve regeneration</field><field name="subject">Topographic map</field><field name="subject">GABAergic inhibition</field><field name="subject">Glutamak receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diving injuries amongst Western Australian scuba course graduates</field><field name="creator">Buzzacott, Peter Lee</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Introduction, Little is known about the prevalence of post-course diving injuries amongst Western Australian recreational divers, nor is it known which risk factors affect the Western Australian diver&#8217;s likelihood of sustaining a diving injury. Objective, The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of diving-related injuries amongst Western Australians with varying experience since certification as entry-level divers within Western Australia (WA). Specifically, the study compared divers&#8217; experience, behaviour and equipment with their diving injury history. It was hypothesised that diving experience has an effect upon the likelihood of a certified diver suffering any of the diving injuries most commonly reported amongst international diving populations. In addition, the strength of association between diving injuries and other potential risk factors was measured amongst certified Western Australian divers. Methods, A cross sectional survey of Western Australians, whom had completed a recognized entry-level recreational scuba diving course within WA, formed the basis of the study. Diver training facilities within WA posted a four-page questionnaire to divers they had trained to entry-level within the previous six years. The self-administered questionnaire collected data describing the divers&#8217; post-course participation in scuba diving, injury prevalence during the last year, demographic characteristics and prevalence of known or hypothesized diving injury risk factors ... Conclusion, In this study diving experience, measured by the number of dives made during the previous year and the total number of dives made since certification, has not been found associated with the likelihood of reporting having suffered at least one diving injury of any type whilst diving during the previous year. Whilst the limited response rate and self-reporting methodology threaten the validity of the findings of this study, the findings improve our understanding of the type of diving injuries commonly suffered by divers, and of which risk factors are associated with a diver&#8217;s likelihood of suffering a diving related injury within WA. These findings may assist the design of further diving injury research, ultimately leading to the design of diving safety interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of diving injuries amongst Western Australian recreational divers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scuba diving injuries -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Scuba diving accidents -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Scuba diving</field><field name="subject">Diving injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient-specific models of cartilaginous tissues based on laser scanning confocal arthroscopy</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Zeike Amos</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An important field of research in orthopaedic biomechanics is the elucidation and mathematical modelling of the mechanical response of cartilaginous tissues. Such research has applications in the understanding of joint function and degenerative processes, as well as in surgical planning and simulation, and engineering of tissue replacements. In the case of surgical and tissue engineering applications especially, patient-specific mechanical properties are highly desirable. Unfortunately, obtaining such information would generally involve destructive mechanical testing of patient tissue, thus rendering the tissue functionally unusable. Development of a laser scanning confocal arthroscope (LSCA) within our School will soon allow non-invasive extraction of 3D microstructural images of cartilaginous tissues in vivo. It is also envisaged that, linked to a suitably formulated constitutive formulation, such information could allow estimation of tissue mechanical response without physical biopsy. This thesis describes the development of techniques to potentially allow non-invasive patient-specific estimation of tissue mechanical response based on confocal arthroscopy data. A microstructural constitutive model is developed which is capable of directly incorporating LSCA-derived patient-specific structural information. A fibre composite type homogenisation approach is used as the basis for the model. ...  The result is a series of orientation tensors describing the 3D orientation of linear features in the image stack. The developed analysis techniques are used to estimate fibre volume fraction and orientation distribution for each of the meniscal specimens. The developed constitutive model and image-derived structural parameters are finally used to estimate the reaction force history of two meniscal cartilage specimens subjected to partially confined compression. The predictions are made on the basis of the specimens? individual structural condition as assessed by confocal microscopy and involve no tuning of material parameters. Although the model does not reproduce all features of the experimental curves, as an unfitted estimate of mechanical response the prediction is quite accurate. In light of the obtained results it is judged that more general non-invasive estimation of tissue mechanical properties is possible using the developed framework. The likely limitations and potential areas of improvement are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arthroscopy</field><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Connective tissues</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Human mechanics</field><field name="subject">Orthopedics</field><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Constitutive models</field><field name="subject">Viscoelasticity</field><field name="subject">Confocal microscopy</field><field name="subject">Microstructural models</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of acoustic emission monitoring to the detection of flow conditions in centrifugal pumps</field><field name="creator">Sikorska, Joanna Zofia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Centrifugal pumps are the most prevalent, electrically powered rotating machines used today. Each pump is designed to deliver fluid of a given flow rate at a certain pressure. The point at which electrical energy is converted most efficiently into increased pressure is known as the Best Efficiency Point. For a variety of reasons, pumps often operate away from this point (intentionally or otherwise), which not only reduces efficiency, but also increases the likelihood of premature component failure. Acoustic emissions (AE) are high frequency elastic waves, in the range of 20-2000kHz, released when a material undergoes localised plastic deformation. Acoustic emission testing is the process of measuring and analysing these stress waves in an attempt to diagnose the nature and severity of the underlying fault. AE sensors mounted on the surface of a machine or structure also detect any stress waves generated within the fluid being transmitted through to the structure. Unfortunately, attempts to detect incipient component faults in centrifugal pumps using acoustic emission analysis have been complicated by the sensitivity of AE to a pump?s operating state. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to determine how acoustic emission monitoring could be used to identify the hydraulic conditions within a pump. Data was collected during performance tests from a variety of small end-suction pumps and from one much larger double-suction pump. A system was developed to collect, process and analyse any number of AE features (be they related to discrete AE events, or due to the continuous background AE level) from continuously operating equipment.  ... Unfortunately, results from smaller pumps were less conclusive, particularly at low flows, probably due to the relatively small changes in hydraulic energy across the range of flows, and consequent sensitivity to the testing process. However, even in these pumps consistent patterns in hit energies were observed resulting in the conclusion that low to medium flows in centrifugal pumps are typified by a very large number of very low energy (VLE) events. These decrease in number and increase in energy as flow approaches BEP and/or is reduced to very low flows. High flows above BEP are marked by an absence of these VLE events, with bursts having significantly higher energies and spread over a much greater range. Unfortunately, these VLE events are too small to affect averaged trends, indicating that further work on a suitable filter is required. vi</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centrifugal pumps -- Performance</field><field name="subject">Acoustic emission testing</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic measurements</field><field name="subject">Acoustic emission</field><field name="subject">Flow problems</field><field name="subject">Rotating machinery</field><field name="subject">Centrifugal pumps</field><field name="subject">Condition monitoring</field><field name="subject">Cavitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and molecular analysis of the hepatitis C virus</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Scott Andrew</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant human pathogen for which there are limited post-infection therapies and no effective vaccine. Research into HCV is notoriously difficult due to the absence of suitable in vitro and in vivo model systems with which to study the virus. Furthermore, our understanding of HCV host interaction is limited and the mechanisms by which it subverts the host immune system remains largely unknown. Due to the difficult nature associated with studying HCV, the work presented in this thesis was designed to addresses a broad range of issues relating to both clinical and molecular aspects of HCV. Chronic HCV infection is often associated with the development of cirrhosis, end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, histological examination of liver biopsies provides the only approved method with which to assess the level of liver damage. While clinically informative, liver biopsies are highly invasive and may be contraindicative for patients such as haemophiliacs. Cytokine specific ELISPOT assays were used to determine whether cytokine secretion from PBMCs isolated from chronically infected HCV patients could be used as a non-invasive method to assess liver damage. Chronically infected patients with sever liver fibrosis demonstrated a significantly reduced ability to produce IFN-&#947; in response to HCV Core, but not other unrelated antigens, indicating that decreased IFN-&#947; secretion by PBMCs in response to HCV antigen could be used as a non-invasive marker for the development of liver fibrosis ... A series of HCV expression vectors covering the full length of the HCV ORF were constructed and their expression extensively tested before being used to assess the ability of HCV proteins to interact with Jak/STAT mediated Type I IFN signalling. Additionally, an alternative set of HCV IRES-EGFP reporter vectors were developed and used to access HCV IRES functionality between different eukaryotic cell lines. HCV Core protein expressed alone or in concert with E1-P7 and non-structural protein NS5B were shown to significantly reduce Jak/STAT mediated IFN expression. While the influence of HCV Core on Type I IFN signalling is consistent with previous reports in the literature, these results identify a new role for NS5B as a possible candidate protein involved in inhibition of Type I IFN signalling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Liver function tests</field><field name="subject">Clinical analysis</field><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="subject">Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influences of cognitive, experiential and habitual factors in online games playing</field><field name="creator">Said, Laila Refiana</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Online games are an exciting new trend in the consumption of entertainment and provide the opportunity to examine selected antecedents of online game-playing based on studying the cognitive, experiential and habitual factors. This study was divided into two parts. The first part analysed the structural relations among research variables that might explain online game-playing using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. These analyses were conducted on a final sample of 218 online gamers. Specific issues examined were:  If the variables of Perceived Game Performance, Satisfaction, Hedonic Responses, Flow and Habit Strength influence the Intention to Replay an online game.  The importance of factors such as Hedonic Responses and Flow on Satisfaction in online game play. In addition to the SEM, analyses of the participants? reported past playing behaviour were conducted to test whether past game play was simply a matter of random frequency of past behaviour, or followed the specific pattern of the Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD). &#8230; The playing-time distribution was not significantly different to the Gamma distribution, in which the largest number of gamers plays for a short time (light gamers) and only a few gamers account for a large proportion of playing time (heavy gamers). Therefore, the reported time play followed a simple and predictable NBD pattern (Chisquare=. 390; p&gt;.05). This study contributes to knowledge in the immediate field of online games and to the wider body of literature on consumer research. The findings demonstrate that gamers tend to act habitually in their playing behaviour. These findings support the argument that past behaviour (habit) is a better explanation of future behaviour than possible cognitive and affective explanations, especially for the apparent routinesed behaviour pattern on online games. The pattern of online game-playing is consistent with the finding of the NBD pattern in television viewing, in which the generalisability of the NBD model has been found in stable environments of repetitive behaviour. This supports the application of the NBD to areas beyond those of patterns in gambling and the purchase of consumer items. The findings have implications both for managerial and public policy decision-making.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet games -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Electronic games -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Computer games -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Habituation (Neuropsychology)</field><field name="subject">Black box group</field><field name="subject">Recognition algorithm</field><field name="subject">Characteristic polynomial</field><field name="subject">Rank profile</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recovery of 3-D structure using visual texture patterns</field><field name="creator">Loh, Angeline M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] One common task in Computer Vision is the estimation of three-dimensional surface shape from two-dimensional images. This task is important as a precursor to higher level tasks such as object recognition - since shape of an object gives clues to what the object is - and object modelling for graphics. Many visual cues have been suggested in the literature to provide shape information, including the shading of an object, its occluding contours (the outline of the object that slants away from the viewer) and its appearance from two or more views. If the image exhibits a significant amount of texture, then this too may be used as a shape cue. Here, &#8216;texture&#8217; is taken to mean the pattern on the surface of the object, such as the dots on a pear, or the tartan pattern on a tablecloth. This problem of estimating the shape of an object based on its texture is referred to as shape-form-texture and it is the subject of this thesis . . . The work in this thesis is likely to impact in a number of ways. The second shape-form-texture algorithm provides one of the most general solutions to the problem. On the other hand, if the assumptions of the first shape-form-texture algorithm are met, this algorithm provides an extremely usable method, in that users should be able to input images of textured objects and click on the frontal texture to quickly reconstruct a fairly good estimation of the surface. And lastly, the algorithm for estimating the transformation between textures can be used as a part of many shape-form-texture algorithms, as well as being useful in other areas of Computer Vision. This thesis gives two examples of other applications for the method: re-texturing an object and placing objects in a scene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Form perception</field><field name="subject">Materials -- Texture</field><field name="subject">Shapes</field><field name="subject">Transformations (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Geometry, Affine</field><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Texture</field><field name="subject">Shape</field><field name="subject">Affine transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water flow in the roots of three crop species : the influence of root structure, aquaporin activity and waterlogging</field><field name="creator">Bramley, Helen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The hydraulic properties of the roots of three crop species important to Western Australia were examined: wheat (Triticum aestivum), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) and yellow lupin (L. luteus). Generally, the hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) of root systems differs between species and can change in response to adverse conditions. To determine the significance of root anatomy and aquaporin activity on the pathway of water flow through roots, water flow was measured across cell membranes, individual roots and whole root systems. The combination of measurements identified that wheat and lupin roots have contrasting hydraulic properties. Wheat roots absorb water preferentially in the apical region, whereas lupin roots appear to absorb water more evenly along the entire root length. Lupin roots have a greater axial hydraulic conductance than wheat, due to more abundant xylem vessels and axial conductance increases with root length, in conjunction with xylem vessel development. However, water flow through the radial pathway is the limiting factor in whole root hydraulic conductance, in all species. Modelling and the inhibition of aquaporin activity with mercuric chloride demonstrated that radial water flow in wheat roots occurs by a combination of the cell-to-cell and apoplastic pathways, but in lupins, water flow appears to be predominantly apoplastic. Despite the presence of aquaporins in root cell membranes of all species, their role in regulating bulk water flow across roots is not clear in lupins, because of the significance of the apoplastic pathway ... After draining the chambers, the root systems of yellow lupin resumed growth, but there was no subsequent recovery in narrow-leafed lupin root systems. The growth and survival strategies of wheat and lupin root systems are disparate. Wheat root systems are comprised of numerous fine, highly branched, individual roots that extract water near the root tips and have the ability to regulate flow. These attributes may be advantageous in non-uniform or variable environments. Moreover, the ability of wheat roots to regulate flow may not only support survival during waterlogging, but also enhance recovery. In comparison, lupin root systems are designed like conduits, for the rapid uptake and transport of water when conditions are favourable. However, their thick taproots and lack of regulation of water transport or anatomical changes make them unsuitable for very wet soils.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat -- Western Australia -- Roots -- Anatomy</field><field name="subject">Lupinus angustifolius -- Western Australia -- Roots -- Anatomy</field><field name="subject">Lupinus luteus -- Western Australia -- Roots -- Anatomy</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging (Soils) -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Aquaporins</field><field name="subject">Wheat (Triticum aestivum)</field><field name="subject">Aquaporins</field><field name="subject">Lupinus spp</field><field name="subject">Roots</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of lung function using broadband forced oscillations / Cindy Thamrin</field><field name="creator">Thamrin, Cindy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Respiratory system impedance (Zrs) is commonly measured at low to medium frequencies (0.5 - 40 Hz) to infer structural and physiological information about the respiratory system. Coupled with the use of mathematical models of the lungs, Zrs has been used to partition the behaviour of the conductive airways and the respiratory tissues. High-frequency (HF) Zrs beyond 100 Hz has been comparatively less studied and understood. Past work has revealed spectral features at high frequencies termed antiresonances, marked by peaks in the real part of Zrs, often coinciding with zero-crossings in the imaginary part. It has been shown that the first occurrence of antiresonance in humans primarily reflects the contribution of the airways, and is a property of sound wave propagation in the airways. Also, the first antiresonance is altered in diseases such as chronic airflow obstruction, and wheeze in infants. The main aim of this project is to shed further understanding about the first antiresonance, via the behaviour of two parameters characterising this feature of the HF spectrum: the frequency at which the first antiresonance occurs, far,1, and the magnitude of the real part of Zrs at this frequency, Rrs(far,1). In our studies, Zrs is measured as an input impedance using the forced oscillation technique with a loudspeaker-in-box and wavetube setup, and employing pseudorandom frequency signals. We studied the effects of altered lung conditions, first in an animal model, then progressed on to humans. v vi In the rat, we found that both far,1 and Rrs(far,1) tended to decrease together with increasing lung volume. With methacholine(MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction, rats showed increases in far,1 and Rrs(far,1) with increasing MCh dose, but these occurred at higher doses compared to increases in airway resistance. The changes in these HF parameters were independent of the changes in tissue properties. ... It was found that in a group of patients with emphysema, VDRrs(far,1) was significantly more negative, potentially due to alterations to airway dimensions and wall properties. Furthermore, VDRrs(far,1) was correlated with extent of obstruction and hyperinflation, suggesting a relationship with severity of emphysema. These results show that the first antiresonance reflect changes in the airways, and its measurement shows promise as a clinical tool, in its potential as an easy-to-perform assessor of conditions in which the airways are altered.

This study integrated physiological analysis with comparative genomics to identify gene orthologues that may regulate Na+ transport, and designed and implemented molecular markers for developing wheat  L. elongatum recombinant lines with reduced portions of L. elongatum chromatin retaining the Na+ `exclusion? trait. Physiological analysis of leaf Na+ accumulation in wheat  L. elongatum substitution lines confirmed that the 3E chromosome contributes a major effect on reduced leaf Na+ accumulation in wheat when grown at 200 mM NaCl.

During this gestational period, the fetal kidney is undergoing a phase of rapid organogenesis with an increase in renal growth and active nephrogenesis occurring. The studies comprising this thesis examine the effects of prenatal betamethasone exposure on the fetal and adult ovine kidney. The central hypothesis of these studies was that exposure of the fetal kidney to betamethasone in late gestation would change renal structure and induce long-term alterations in the expression of glucocorticoid-sensitive genes and proteins. In the fetal studies, pregnant Merino ewes bearing single fetuses received single or repeated-weekly intra-muscular (i.m.) injections of betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg body weight) or saline commencing on day 104 of gestation (term is 150 days). Kidneys were collected from fetuses at 109, 116, 121 and 146 days of gestation (d). Using gold standard unbiased stereological techniques, the physical disector/fractionator method, total glomerular (nephron) number and glomerular volume were determined in 146 d fetal kidneys exposed to repeated maternal saline or betamethasone administration. In the adult study, kidneys were collected from 3.5-year-old sheep that had been exposed to   ... In this thesis I have demonstrated that renal growth restriction as a result of betamethasone exposure is associated with a reduction in fetal nephron endowment. Although betamethasone does not appear to consistently alter nephron number or glomerular size, it may indirectly affect total nephron endowment through effects on renal growth. I have also provided evidence which suggests that lategestation betamethasone exposure in sheep does not program permanent alterations in the renal expression of genes or proteins involved in glucocorticoid hormone action or components of the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, exposure of the fetal kidney to betamethasone during nephrogenesis may alter renal structure if kidney growth is perturbed; however, there are no persistent alterations in the expression of glucocorticoid-sensitive genes. These findings are consistent with the preservation of normal basal blood pressure in the adult sheep I studied and with the limited results from human studies of late-gestation maternal glucocorticoid administration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal tissues</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Fetuses -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Abnormalities</field><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Effect of drugs on</field><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids</field><field name="subject">Ovine kidney</field><field name="subject">Antenatal corticosteroids</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the effects of HLS5 : a novel member of the RBCC family</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Martin John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Erythropoietin (Epo) is a glycoprotein hormone involved in the formation of erythrocytes, by controlling survival, differentiation and proliferation. The technique of cDNA Representational Difference Analysis was utilized to investigate J2E-NR cells that demonstrate a viability response to Epo, but not differentiation or proliferation. The aim of this project was to identify genes that may be upregulated in response to Epo-induced survival; however, no change in gene expression was detected. This was most probably because any changes were below the limit of detectability for the cDNA RDA technique, or the viability effect was mediated post-transcriptionally. Next, it was decided to investigate HLS5, a putative tumour suppressor that was identified in a myeloid variant of the J2E cell line and had been shown to cause apoptosis. A number of HeLa cell lines inducible for Hls5 expression using the tet-off system were produced; despite extremely low expression, Hls5 was shown to produce marked suppression of growth and proliferation, particularly in colony assays  colony size and numbers were halved for one induced clone. &#8230; A number of haemopoiesis-associated genes were downregulated (viz. globin genes and the Epo receptor gene), which suggested Hls5s role in the myeloid variant of J2E cells, may be to suppress genes expressed in the erythroid lineage. In addition, several interferon-responsive genes were decreased in cells with elevated HLS5, suggesting it may play a role in negatively regulating interferon signaling. Online databases were also searched for information on HLS5, and showed that it is significantly downregulated in liver, lung and uterine cancers, supporting the proposition that HLS5 is a tumour suppressor gene. In summary, a number of approaches were taken to identify the effects of the Hls5 protein. It appears that it strongly suppresses proliferation and that this is likely mediated through an effect on mitosis. This may also result in apoptosis of overexpressing cells. It is possible that this is the mechanism through which HLS5 exerts its potential tumour suppressor function, as a number of tumour suppressors appear to be associated with mitosis/apoptosis control. Hls5 is also likely to have other functions in haemopoietic cells, which includes downregulation of erythroid-specific genes and suppression of interferon responses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Erythropoietin</field><field name="subject">Tumor suppressor proteins</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">HLS5</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">RBCC</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational guanxi and state-owned enterprises in South-west China</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Stephen John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis investigates the phenomenon of organisational guanxi in business in the SOE hotel environment in south-west China.

This thesis also analyses the implications of the continued practice of organizational guanxi and the prospects of its future as the Chinese economy continues to evolve toward a more market orientation.  In Chapter One, the phenomena of guanxi, mainzi and renqing are defined and the importance of their role in conducting business in mainland China proposed. &#8230; The findings of this new research in south-west China provide conclusive evidence that in this region the guanxi network remains the lifeblood of the business community (Kao, 1993). In addition, this research throws up some conclusions that are not aligned with that of Guthrie?s (2002) Shanghai-based findings.  In Chapter Nine, The Conclusion, the major findings of this thesis are revisited and include the acknowledgement and definition of organisational guanxi, the exploration of the roots of organisational guanxi inside the danwei, the differentiation of intra-organisational guanxi from inter-organisational guanxi, the definition of the concept of guanxi neglect, and a comparison of the decay in the strength and usage of guanxi in south-west China with that in the Shanghai region.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Hotel management -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Hotels -- Government ownership -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Hotels -- China, Southwest -- Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Organisational Guanxi in SOE in China</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lucerne (Medicago sativa) productivity and its effect on the water balance in southern Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Dolling, Perry</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In southern Western Australia the replacement of deep-rooted native vegetation with annual species has resulted in rising water tables and increased salinity due to insufficient water use. The area has a Mediterranean-type climate where rainfall during summer is generally low but variable resulting in limited plant growth. However, if rainfall does occur it potentially can contribute to to the increased water excess or drainage by increasing the soil water content before the main drainage period in winter. The first study investigated factors controlling soil water content changes during the fallow (December to May) in annual farming systems. This was achieved by examining variation in available soil water storage to a depth of 1.0-1.5 m at three sites within 13 seasons. Reasons for the variation were examined using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). This study also investigated the relationship between soil water content at the end of the fallow period (1 May) and the amount of drainage below 2.5 m by using APSIM coupled to historical weather records at three locations. At the end of the fallow a mean of 24 mm (or 25%) of rainfall during the fallow was retained in the soil. Losses of soil water during the fallow were due to evaporation (mean of 60 mm), transpiration from plant cover (mean of 12 mm) and drainage below the root zone and run off (combined mean of 13 mm). Soil water accumulation during the fallow period had a significant impact on simulated drainage under wheat in the following growing season. Every 1 mm increase in soil wetness at the end of the fallow resulted in a 0.7-1 mm increase in simulated drainage during the growing season. ...   Variation in the water excess due to variation in rainfall was greater than the reduction in water excess due to lucerne. This makes the decisions about when to grow lucerne to reduce water excess difficult if livestock enterprises are less profitable than cropping enterprises. The findings of this PhD indicate that lucerne does have a place in Mediterranean-type environments because of its greater water use than current farming practices. However, its use needs to be strategic and the strategy will vary from region to region. For example, in the low rainfall region lucerne sowings need to be matched with high soil water contents and phase length will generally be short (2-3 years). In comparison at high rainfall regions lucerne will need to be grown for longer or combined with other strategies to increase water use.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alfalfa -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Plants, Effect of soil moisture on -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Plant-water relationships -- Australia, Southwestern</field><field name="subject">Lucerne</field><field name="subject">Water use</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the expression of the topographic guidance molecules, EphA5 and ephrin-A2, as well as metallothionein function, in the injured and regenerating adult mammalian visual system</field><field name="creator">Symonds, Andrew C. E.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] During development of the visual system, topographic connections between the retina and the superior colliculus are established using guidance molecules. The EphA family of tyrosine kinase receptors and their ephrin-A ligands are important for establishing topography between the temporo-nasal axis of the retina and the rostro-caudal axis of the superior colliculus. After injury to the visual system via unilateral optic nerve transection, adult mammalian retinal ganglion cells fail to regenerate axons spontaneously to their main visual centre, which in rodents, is the superior colliculus. The EphA5 gradient is down-regulated from a temporalhigh to nasallow gradient to a uniform low level in the few surviving retinal ganglion cells, but ephrin-A2 is upregulated back to a significant rostrallow to caudalhigh gradient in the superior colliculus, similar to that seen during development. In this thesis, a number of experiments have been undertaken to investigate further how EphA5 and ephrin-A2 are regulated after injury and how they may play a role once regeneration has been encouraged through surgical intervention. In the first study, targeted unilateral retinal laser lesions were used to ablate either dorso-nasal or ventro-temporal quadrants of the retina. ... Surviving and regenerating retinal ganglion cells in the retina, and axons in the optic nerve, were analysed. The data suggest that metallothionein-I/II increases axonal regeneration through the optic nerve injury site but, at the dose administered, had no neuroprotective effects on retinal ganglion cells. This thesis provides further insight into the response of guidance molecules to injury, and the potential of metallothionein-I/II as a neuroregenerative factor in the adult mammalian visual system. The regulation of both EphA5 and ephrin-A2 through transsynaptic connections may be a response common to other guidance molecules. Such connectivity now needs to be studied further to understand how it may impact on various treatments designed to increase re-connectivity after other brain injuries, including stroke. The ectopic expression of ephrin-A2 at the insertion site of a peripheral nerve graft in the superior colliculus, implicate this guidance molecule in the glial scar for the first time. Therefore, to overcome inhibition by the glial scar, axons must also overcome ephrin-A2 mediated inhibition, potentially by the addition of EphA5 fusion proteins. Metallothionein-I/II?s effect of increasing axonal regeneration through the optic nerve injury site suggests that it could be used to increase the number of regenerating axons reaching their target. Such strategies to increase the absolute number of regenerated axons should enable these axons to better use the EphA5 and ephrin-A2 topographic gradients to optimize regenerative success.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eye -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Retina -- Cytology</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Metallothionein</field><field name="subject">Visual system</field><field name="subject">Topography</field><field name="subject">Regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA-based approaches for development of markers to assist Grevillea and Leucadendron breeding</field><field name="creator">Pharmawati, Made</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Grevillea and Leucadendron belong to Proteaceae and both have economic importance to the floriculture industry. Grevillea is a highly diverse genus endemic to Australia and very attractive for landscaping. Leucadendron is a South African Proteaceae but is cultivated in Australia and is well known as a cut flower. This thesis focuses on the application of DNA-based molecular markers to these genera. Several groupings within Grevillea were suggested by previous researchers based on morphological characteristics. In this thesis the monophyly of the groupings among 12 Grevillea species from New South Wales was tested using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analyses. To test the robustness of the data, UPGMA using Jaccard similarity, Neighbor Joining using total character difference and Wagner parsimony analyses were undertaken. The relationship trees generated supported monophyly of the groupings. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) was used to develop phylogenetic relationships among Leucadendron species. Inheritance and variation of cpDNA were evaluated using PCR-RFLP. The study demonstrated that cpDNA was inherited maternally and a phylogenetic tree of Leucadendron species using parsimony analysis was constructed.  ...   A fingerprinting study conducted using ISSR, produced a dendrogram showing the relationships among 30 cultivars. From the results, i a fingerprinting key was developed. Three examples of synonymous cultivar pairs were identified. In Leucadendron the male and female flowers develop on separate plants, and sex identification is only possible at time of flowering. ISSR, suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH), and SSH combined with mirror orientation selection (MOS) were used in attempts of identifying sex-dependent DNA fragments at earlier stages of plant development. Neither of these techniques was able to identify sex-specific markers in Leucadendron. Nevertheless, the results did indicate that cpDNA copy number may differentiate male and female plants. Also, it was demonstrated that the genomes of male and female plants are quite homologous, which increases the difficulty in identifying sex-specific sequences. This thesis highlights the potential of DNA-based markers to determine species relationships in Grevillea and Leucadendron, as well as to identify Leucadendron cultivars. The information produced during the research for this thesis provides a basis for Grevillea and Leucadendron variety development and may be used to assist the design of interspecific crosses, to identify cultivars and the parents of hybrids. In addition, the results offer insights into the likelihood, problems and strategies of finding sex-specific markers for genes controlling sex in Leucadendron. ii</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grevillea -- Australia -- Molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">Leucadendron -- Australia -- Molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Breeding -- Australia</field><field name="subject">DNA marker</field><field name="subject">Grevillea</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital, neighbourhood environments and health : development of measurement tools and exploration of links through qualitative and quantitative research</field><field name="creator">Wood, Lisa Jane</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] BACKGROUND This thesis explored the relationship between social capital, sense of community and mental health and wellbeing; and factors that may influence these within the environments in which people live. Area variations in health are well documented and are mirrored in emerging evidence of geographic and neighbourhood variations in social capital. Little is known, however, about the specific facets of the impact of local physical environment on social capital; or about the mechanisms by which these are linked with each other, and with health determinants and outcomes. Despite the recent proliferation of social capital literature and growing research interest within the public health realm, its relationship to mental health and protective factors for mental health have also been relatively unexplored. AIMS The overall aim of this thesis was to explore the potential associations between social capital, health and mental health, and neighbourhood environments. In particular, the thesis considered whether the physical attributes and street network design of neighbourhoods are associated with social capital or particular dimensions of the social capital construct. It also examined the relationship between social capital and demographic and residency factors and pet ownership ... CONCLUSION The combined use of qualitative and quantitative research is a distinguishing feature of this study, and the triangulation of these data has a unique contribution to make to the social capital literature. Studies concerned with the measurement of social capital to date have tended to focus on dimensions pertaining to people&#8217;s involvement, perceptions and relationship with others and their community. While these constructs provide insight into what comprises social capital, it is clear that each is in turn influenced by a range of other factors. Elucidating what fosters trust and neighbourly interactions in one community and not in another, and by what mechanisms, is one of many research questions unanswered in the published literature to date. The consideration of measures of social capital that relate to the physical environment is therefore of relevance to the growing research and public policy interest in identifying what might build or restore social capital in communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology) -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Neighborhood -- Health aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Neighborhood -- Western Australia -- Planning</field><field name="subject">Communities -- Health aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Communities -- Western Australia -- Planning</field><field name="subject">Social networks -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matrix groups : theory, algorithms and applications</field><field name="creator">Ambrose, Sophie</field><field name="description">[Abstract] This thesis is divided into two parts, both containing algorithms for dealing with matrices and matrix groups. Part I is concerned with individual matrices over an arbitrary field. Our algorithms make use of a sequence called the rank profile which is related to the linear dependence relations between the columns of a matrix. First we look at LSP decompositions of matrices as defined by Ibarra et al. in 1982. This decomposition is related to, and a little more general than, the LUP decomposition. The algorithm given by Ibarra et al. to compute an LSP decomposition was only defined for m?n matrices where m &#8804; n and is claimed to have the same asymptotic cost as matrix multiplication. We prove that their cost analysis overlooked some aspects of the computation and present a new version of the algorithm which finds both an LSP decomposition and the rank profile of any matrix. The cost of our algorithm is the same as that claimed by Ibarra et al. when  m  &#8804; n and has a similar cost when m &gt; n. One of the steps in the Ibarra et al. algorithm is not completely explicit, so that any one of several choices can be made. Our algorithm is designed so that the particular choice made at this point allows for the simultaneous calculation of the rank profile. Next we study algorithms to find the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix. The current fastest algorithm to find the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix was developed by Keller-Gehrig in 1985. We present a new, simpler version of this algorithm with the same cost which makes the algorithm?s reliance on the rank profile explicit. In Part II we present generalised sifting, a scheme for creating Monte Carlo black box constructive group recognition algorithms. Generalised sifting is designed to facilitate computation in a known group, specifically re-writing arbitrary elements as words or straight-line programs in a standard generating set. It can also be used to create membership tests in black-box groups. Generalised sifting was inspired by the subgroup sifting techniques originally introduced by Sims in 1970 but uses a chain of subsets rather than subgroups. We break the problem down into a sequence of separately analysed and proven steps which sift down into each subset in turn ... All of the algorithms in Parts I and II are given with a theoretical proof and (where appropriate) complexity analysis. The LSP decomposition, characteristic polynomial and generalised sifting algorithms have all been implemented and tested in the computer algebra package GAP.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Matrix groups</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Monte Carlo method</field><field name="subject">Black box group</field><field name="subject">Recognition algorithm</field><field name="subject">Characteristic polynomial</field><field name="subject">Rank profile</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling and electrophysiological monitoring of the regulation of cochlear amplification</field><field name="creator">O'Beirne, Greg A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The cochlea presumably possesses a number of regulatory mechanisms to maintain cochlear sensitivity in the face of disturbances to its function. Evidence for such mechanisms can be found in the time-course of the recovery of CAP thresholds during experimental manipulations, and in observations of slow oscillations in cochlear micromechanics following exposure to low-frequency tones (the &#8220;bounce phenomenon&#8221;) and other perturbations. To increase our understanding of these oscillatory processes within the cochlea, and OHCs in particular, investigations into cochlear regulation were carried out using a combination of mathematical modelling of the ionic and mechanical interactions likely to exist within the OHCs, and electrophysiological experiments conducted in guinea pigs. The electrophysiological experiments consisted of electrocochleographic recordings and, in some cases, measurement of otoacoustic emissions, during a variety of experimental perturbations, including the application of force to the cochlear wall, exposure to very-low-frequency tones, injection of direct current into scala tympani, and intracochlear perfusions of artificial perilymph containing altered concentrations of potassium, sodium, and sucrose. To obtain a panoramic view of cochlear regulation under these conditions, software was written to enable the interleaved and near-simultaneous measurement of multiple indicators of cochlear function, including the compound action potential (CAP) threshold, amplitude and waveshape at multiple frequencies, the OHC transfer curves derived from low-frequency cochlear microphonic (CM) waveforms, distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), the spectrum of the round-window neural noise (SNN), and the endocochlear potential (EP). ... The mathematical model we have developed provided a physiologically-plausible and internally-consistent explanation for the time-courses of the cochlear changes observed during a number of different perturbations. We show that much of the oscillatory behaviour within the cochlea is consistent with underlying oscillations in cytosolic calcium concentration. We conclude that a number of the discrepancies between the simulation results and the experimental data can be resolved if the cytosolic calcium functions as two distinct pools: one which controls basolateral permeability and one which controls slow motility. This two-calcium-pool model is discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Electrocochleography</field><field name="subject">Otoacoustic emissions -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Cochlea -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Auditory evoked response</field><field name="subject">Outer hair cells</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and its mRNA : influence of genetic polymorphisms, a fat load and statin therapy</field><field name="creator">Pocathikorn, Anothai</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family is involved in numerous biological processes including lipoprotein metabolism. This thesis concerns investigations into some aspects of LRP metabolism/regulation and possible roles in coronary artery disease (CAD). Specific aims were: to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the LRP gene and in its associated protein, the lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (RAP), with the risk of CAD; to extensively examine the influence of the LRP exon 22 C200T polymorphism on lipid metabolism; to develop and characterise assays for the mRNA expression of LRP and 2 other genes relevant to lipid metabolism, the LDL receptor (LDLR), and HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR); and finally, to apply the latter techniques to studies on the influence of genetic variation in LRP, and dietary and drug interventions, on LRP, LDLR and HMGCR mRNA expression in nucleated blood cells from healthy human subjects. Six hundred CAD subjects and 700 similarly aged controls were genotyped for 8 LRP gene polymorphisms as well as for the RAP V311M polymorphism. ... In the final phase of my studies, I examined the influence of 4 weeks therapy with a cholesterol lowering drug, an HMGCR inhibitor, atorvastatin (20mg daily), on the mRNA expression of LDLR, LRP and HMGCR in human nucleated blood cells. Twelve normal Caucasian male subjects aged 49 ? 5 (SD) years were studied. Plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C decreased by averages of 29 % and 41 % after the 4 week period. This was accompanied by an elevation in LDLR mRNA expression by approximately 30  35 %. In contrast, there was no significant effect on LRP and HMGCR mRNA expression. In conclusion, the original findings in this thesis included: demonstration of a strong influence of the LRP exon 22 C200T polymorphism on coronary artery disease and LDLR expression, but without a clear effect on fasting or postprandial lipid levels; data on the biological variation in LDLR and LRP gene expression in nucleated blood cells from normal subjects; the influence of an oral fat load on the expression viii of these genes, finding that LDLR was significantly depressed; and finally, the observation that statin therapy upregulated LDLR in nucleated blood cells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipoproteins -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Messenger RNA</field><field name="subject">Lipid metabolism</field><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">Lipoprotein metabolism</field><field name="subject">Postprandial lipid metabolism</field><field name="subject">Genetic polymorphisms</field><field name="subject">MRNA quantification</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an electrical generation scheme using wind energy</field><field name="creator">Nayar, C.

Evans and Wurster (1999, 2000) examined these ideas in terms of &#8220;richness and reach&#8221;. Berger, Hancock &amp; Marquardt (1996) proposed a framework for analysing efficiency, risks, costs and innovations in the payments system. In this, they called for additional research into risks and costs in various aspects of the international payments systems and offered a framework for such an examination. This dissertation examines these and other authors&#8217; work from the literature, follows the development of actual systems newly implemented for international trade finance, and considers the impacts of electronic commerce on the field of international trade finance, in particular its effect on the costs and risks involved. This question is important because the burden of paper-based documentation that controls international trade is approximately 6% of $USD7.5 trillion per year. If efficiencies, even small ones, can be gained in this overhead cost, at an acceptable level of risk, then a substantial saving in real dollar terms can be achieved each year, improving the efficiency of world trade and easing the burden on both suppliers and consumers worldwide. The research questions are examined by means of a three round Delphi survey (three iterations of questionnaires with analysis and feedback between rounds) of a panel of experts drawn from international bankers, users of trade finance, and academic researchers into international trade finance and e-commerce. The survey first identifies the factors of greatest import and interest. It then digs deeper and seeks consensus on areas where there is divergent opinion, and finally seeks to critique a model based on the Berger, Hancock &amp; Marquardt (1996) model. In the process the panel is able to estimate the approximate size of shifts in both costs and risks expected from the implementation of e-commerce methods. These are examined in light of the Malone Yates &amp; Benjamin (1987) and Evans &amp; Wurster (2000) theories and found to be consistent. This empirical confirmation of theoretical expectation, combined with estimates of the size of change are then used to make specific recommendations to various participants in the field of international trade finance so that they can reap the benefits of the transition in process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial institutions, International</field><field name="subject">Clearinghouses (Banking)</field><field name="subject">Foreign exchange</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">E-commerce</field><field name="subject">International trade</field><field name="subject">Trade finance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological genetic consequences of local endemism and natural population fragmentation in Banksia ilicifolia (Proteaceae)</field><field name="creator">Heliyanto, Bambang</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The species-rich Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SAFR) is a global biodiversity hotspot. Characterised by a Mediterranean-type climate and nutrient deficient landscape, this region is endowed with 7380 native vascular plant species/sub species, of which 49% are endemic and 2500 are of conservation concern. Despite the global significance of this region, there is still only a poor understanding of the factors influencing high diversity and endemism, and especially the population genetic consequences of narrow endemism and naturally fragmented species distribution. Holly leaved banksia (Banksia ilicifolia R. Br.), although widespread through Southwest Western Australia (SWWA), has a naturally fragmented distribution, with generally small populations restricted to swales and wetland fringes with depth to groundwater less than 10 m. As such, it provides an excellent model to better understand the ecological genetic consequences of local endemism, population size and natural population fragmentation . . .  Products of wide outcrossing (over 30 km) showed a heterosis effect over local outcrossing, indicating increased ecological amplitude of offspring following interpopulation mating. These results suggest that the breeding and mating biology of B. ilicifolia counters the negative genetic erosion effects of narrow ecological amplitude and small population size. Recent habitat fragmentation, and reductions in population size and increased isolation, is impacting on these processes, but further research is required to assess the ultimate consequences of these genetic effects for population viability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">Banksia -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Ecological genetics</field><field name="subject">Ecological genetics</field><field name="subject">Local endemism</field><field name="subject">Banksia ilicifolia</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A modernist sensibility and Christian wit in the work of Tom Gibbons</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Phillip Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of how spiritual ideas have contributed to West Australian academic and artist Tom Gibbons&#8217;s approach to Modernism. Against the backdrop of the local context I show how Gibbons&#8217;s 1950s undergraduate and 1960s post-graduate studies in the area of the occult and esoteric influences on Early Modernism provided him with an atypical perspective on Modernism itself but that this perspective resulted in his development of a Modernist sensibility particularly suitable for the type of questions asked about art in the later part of last century. My thesis traces Gibbons&#8217;s development of an integrated aesthetic &#8220;theory&#8221; that bridged for him the gap between a host of contrary sources. For Gibbons the bridge between divergent views on art, from the Modern period to the Renaissance period, is an ahistorical perspective based on Christian Immanence. He thus adopted a perspective that redefined the metaphysical aspects of Modernist abstraction through a particular approach to realism which celebrates the everyday world because of the Christian structures that for him condition it. I argue that his sensibility, which combines the stylistic features of a Modernist literature  witty juxtaposition, irony and paradox  with the concept of Christian Immanence, resulted in an oeuvre which can be read as a particular example of what Ken Wilber in the late 1990s termed Integral Studies. I argue that underlying Gibbons&#8217;s use of Christian Immanence is the Integralist&#8217;s understanding that the world&#8217;s great philosophical and spiritual traditions approach consciousness and experience through similar ideas. The argument presented, in agreement with writers such as Wilber, is that Gibbons&#8217;s capacity to develop a sense of life&#8217;s irony and metaphor, and to then use this as a capacity to embrace the beauty and outrageousness of the whole, is a mature spirituality that provides an integrated perspective filled with joy for the ordinary.

Affect-as-information (Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1983) and affect-priming (Bower, 1991) theories predict that anxiety causes people to form affect-congruent (i.e., more threatening) impressions of others. A novel research paradigm was used in Experiment 1 to separate the predictions of these two classes of theories, recognizing that their predictions were not mutually exclusive. Experiment 1 found that anxious persons formed more threatening, but not more stereotypic, impressions of a target person. This result replicated in Experiment 2, with a different population and a different anxiety manipulation. In addition, Experiment 2 found that the anxiety-congruent bias in impression formation was limited to participants? ratings of traits that corresponded to the information presented about the target. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 were taken as support for an affect-priming rather than affect-as-information account of the effect of anxiety on impression formation. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated anxiety effects on encoding and recall that underlie affect-priming explanation of affect-congruent impression judgment biases. Experiment 3 found that anxious participants spent more time encoding non-stereotypic information and recalled less stereotypic information than non-anxious participants. In Experiment 4 anxious participants again recalled less stereotypic information. This study also found that anxious participants? recall and impression judgments were affect-congruent. ... As predicted by the modified affect-as-information theory, the affect-attribution manipulation left participants? anxiety levels unaltered but it did attenuate the anxiety-congruent impression bias. In addition, anxious participants in this study recalled less stereotypic than non-stereotypic information. The findings of this thesis raised several new questions and theoretical challenges. The new experimental paradigms that were used to examine the questions in this thesis will also allow the examination of the interplay of stereotypes and valence in judgments in future research for persons in affective states other than anxiety. Such research would allow for the continued revision and development of theories of affect and social cognition.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Impression formation (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotype (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Affect (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotyping</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="subject">Impressions</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Mood</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrodynamics of the human body during the freestyle tumble turn</field><field name="creator">Lyttle, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis contains three cross-sectional studies and an equipment development study, presented in the form of journal submissions, regarding the hydrodynamics experienced by swimmers during the various phases of the freestyle tumble turn.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics</field><field name="subject">Swimming turns</field><field name="subject">Freestyle</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision mechanism, knowledge representation, and software architecture for an intelligent control system</field><field name="creator">Malaviya, Anoop Kumar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis analyses the problem of Intelligent Control for large industrial plants and suggests a hierarchical, distributed, object-oriented architecture for Intelligent Control.

It did so by examining the relationships between pool stability (measured by persistence of water through time, and variation in maximum pool depth through time) and the number and type of species within pools, temporal fluctuations in total fish abundance and intra-specific abundance, population size frequency distributions, and growth rate. It also examined the association between life history traits and the stability of the environments occupied within the river, and the stability of the river at large. The results indicated that environmental stability was the major factor structuring the fish communities. Among-pool comparisons revealed that unstable pools contained fewer species, a greater fraction of juvenile size classes, and underwent greater fluctuations in total and intra-specific numerical abundance through time, than stable pools . . . Stability affected community structure by determining (or describing) the probability that a pool would undergo periods of extreme shrinkage, that is, the likelihood that fish will be exposed to extreme physico-chemical fluctuations and complete eradication. While the physical environment (acting through stability) primarily structured the fish communities of the Fortescue River there was indirect evidence that even within this variable river system, biological interactions played a role, albeit minor.

It will also try to identify any factors that constrain or influence teachers&#8217; practice. The research employed a grounded theory approach involving semi-structured interviews and classroom observations of preschool teachers. The findings of this study indicate that the teachers primarily conceptualise creativity as something mainly but not exclusively to do with art work . . . Teachers&#8217; actual practice mainly consists of teacher control, enforcement of obedience, rote learning, teacher directed and teacher chosen activities and heavy emphasis on whole-class teaching. Other mediating constraints on their promotion of creativity included: pressure from Primary 1 teachers, parents and the officials in Ministry of Educations to complete and adhere to the National Curriculum; teachers&#8217; own pedagogical limitations; large class size; lack of adult help and the presence of special children in the classroom; lack of resources and pressure from other non-teaching commitments.

The aim of this thesis was to link results from virological, pathogenesis and epidemiological studies to further define RRV disease in the south-west (SW) of Western Australia (WA), a region of endemic and epizootic RRV activity. A crosssectional seroprevalence study was used to show that 7.8 percent of SW communities were seropositive to RRV, comparable to other regions of Australia with similar temperate climates to the SW . . . RRV-specific IgM antibodies were found to persist for at least two years following RRV infection. A murine model was used to conclusively show differences in pathogenesis between RRV genotypes, the SW and northern-eastern (NE) genotypes, which are known to circulate throughout Australia. The SW genotype, unique to the SW of WA induced only poor neutralising antibody production and nonneutralising antibodies after the acute phase of infection. In comparison, the NE genotype which currently predominates in mosquito populations in the SW of WA, induced the most efficient neutralising antibody response and consequently produced the mildest disease in the mouse. These data in the mouse suggest that the infecting genotype will mostly likely influence disease outcome in humans and could at least partially explain why more severe and persistent disease has been reported from the SW of WA. Collectively, results from this thesis provide an important benchmark against which future investigations into BFV and RRV diseases can be measured.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arbovirus infections -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Genotype-environment interaction -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Arbovirus infections -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Ross River virus -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Mosquito-borne disease</field><field name="subject">Viral pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">Ross river virus</field><field name="subject">Arthritis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical inference in continuous-time models with short-range and/or long-range dependence</field><field name="creator">Casas Villalba, Isabel</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to estimate the volatility function of continuoustime stochastic models.

Under the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), the compatibility of the Vasicek, the CIR, the Anh and Gao, and the CKLS models with the stock market indexes is being tested. Nonparametric techniques are presented to test the affinity of these parametric volatility functions with the volatility observed from the data. Under the assumption of possible statistical patterns in the volatility process, a new estimation procedure based on the Whittle estimation is proposed.

The exchange of carbon and nitrogen between the host plant (legume) and the nitrogen- fixing micro-symbiont is vital for biological nitrogen fixation. In particular, transport of C4-dicarboxylates, mainly malate, from the plant to the micro-symbiont, and the reverse transport of fixed nitrogen in the form of ammonium are essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. In the legume nodule, the symbiosome membrane (SM) surrounds the bacteroid and all exchanges of metabolites and nutrients that occur between the plant and the micro-symbiont must cross this membrane. Recently it has been established that cycling of amino acids across the SM is also critical for optimal symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Therefore to fully understand this agriculturally significant phenomenon, the mechanisms facilitating these exchanges need to be investigated. The major aim of this study was to increase the understanding of nutrient exchange within the nodule at the molecular level by isolating and characterising genes encoding transporters responsible for malate and amino acids transport in soybean (Glycine max, L.), with particular interest in genes significantly or highly expressed in nodules. A combination of molecular and biochemical techniques was used to achieve this. ... Southern blot analysis showed that a small gene family of up to five members encodes these proteins in soybean. A full-length cDNA, designated GmAAP5, was isolated that encodes a novel, putative amino acid transporter. Molecular characterisation of this cDNA and that of GmAAP1 (GenBank Accession no: AY029352), a previously identified putative amino acid transporter gene, was done. Expression analyses showed relatively high expression of GmAAP5 in soybean nodules compared to that in leaf and root tissues, while GmAAP1 showed uniformly high expression in root, leaf and nodule tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of known functional AAPs from dicotyledonous plants revealed that GmAAP1 is most closely related to AAP2 from V. faba, while GmAAP5 is more closely related to AAPs from non-leguminous plants than from leguminous plants. Based on the functional characterisation of the AAPs with which GmAAP1 and GmAAP5 cluster, it is likely that both transporters are neutral and acidic amino acid transporters within the AAP subfamily.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Root-tubercles</field><field name="subject">Soybean</field><field name="subject">Symbiosis</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen -- Fixation</field><field name="subject">Transporter</field><field name="subject">Soybean</field><field name="subject">Plant</field><field name="subject">Dicarboxilate</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery of algal assemblages from canopy disturbance : patterns and processes over a range of reef structures</field><field name="creator">Toohey, Benjamin D</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Kelp beds of South-Western Australia have high alpha (within habitat) diversity, through high species turnover at small spatial scales. The E. radiata canopy has a strong negative influence on the diversity of the understorey through intense interspecific competition for light. Literature suggests that when the competitively dominant species such as E. radiata are physically removed, diversity will increase, as less competitive species become more abundant. Apart from disturbance, evidence suggests that reef topography at the 1-10 m vertical scale also has an influence on the structure of the kelp beds, particularly in reference to relative abundance of canopy algae and species richness of the assemblage. In this thesis, I explore the role of algal assemblage recovery from physical disturbance to maintain high diversity. I also investigate the influence of reef structure (in terms of topography at the 1-10 m vertical scale) on assemblage recovery. This thesis provides a valuable functional explanation for the high diversity observed in South-Western algal assemblages. In addition, it explores the influence of reef topography which has received little attention to date . . . Overall, this thesis argues that the high alpha diversity in algal assemblages of South-Western Australia is due to local scale processes including disturbance and assemblage recovery which generate diversity by the creation of species rich gap states and by phase-shifts during the recovery process, creating a mosaic of different patch types. Assemblage recovery is composed of several processes, including survival of juvenile kelp sporophytes and canopy shading, added to macroalgal diversity through spatial and temporal variation in their outcomes. Reef topography contributed to algal diversity by influencing the processes associated with assemblage recovery through alteration of key physical variables including light levels and water motion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecklonia radiata</field><field name="subject">Kelp bed ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Reef ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Submarine topography -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Reefs -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">Marine algae -- Western Australia -- South West</field><field name="subject">South-West (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Reef topography</field><field name="subject">Kelp</field><field name="subject">Ecklonia radiata</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of the cerebral palsies in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Fiona J</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of seven Sections. Each Section contains a set of published papers, reports or chapters which describe epidemiological aspects of the Cerebral Palsies (CPs). These have, in the main, made use of of the Western Australian Cerebral Palsy Register. Several of the chapters are from a recent book (Stanley and Alberman, 1984), which was an invited monograph in a series published jointly by Spastics International Medical Publications and Blackwells, Oxford. The published work in each Section is introduced and moulded together by text with the aim of making it flow as a composite whole. The numbers and rates differ between papers as the register is continually being updated and recent figures are more accurate and complete than in earlier publications. The Register was established in 1977, with the aims of being basically descriptive: to provide accurate numerator data on the major cause of childhood motor handicap. In addition it was planned to utlisie the data base as a population sampling frame for epidemiological studies searching for causes of the CPs. It is now an ongoing collection and it is the only population-based Cerebral Palsy Register in Australia. Four others exist in the world, one in Denmark (Hansen, 1960; Glenting, 1976), one in Sweden (Hagberg et al., 1975a, 1975b, 1976), one in County Cork, Ireland (Cussen et al., 1978), and one in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in UK (Hey, personal communication). It is of considerable current interest, as paediatric research is expanding into the causes of childhood handicaps generally, and perinatal researchers are keen to monitor the trends of major handicap in relation to changes in perinatal care.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebral palsy -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Perinatal factor</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2006.0137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The clumsy child : a study of developmental apraxia and agnosia</field><field name="creator">Gubbay, Sasson S.</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with a) The investigation of the problem of clumsiness resulting from developmental apraxia and agnosia ; b) the development of effective screening tests particularly suitable for employment by medical practitioners and specialist schoolteachers for the identification of these children.

This study in turn stimulated a clinical survey of developmental clumsiness in Western Australian schoolchildren described and analysed in Chapters 3 and 4. It was anticipated that this survey would yield information regarding the magnitude of the problem and would provide normative data regarding motor performance in children. Subsequently these data were to be the basis of a set of standardized tests of motor proficiency in children (Chapter 4). In order to obtain information efficiently and to develop these tests it seemed most rational to commence with a pilot study of a relatively small number of children, when after statistical analysis it would become evident which tests were the most reliable, effective and convenient (Chapter 3).

Syntactic pattern recognition recognises that patterns may be hierarchically structured. Formal language theory is an example of a syntactic approach, and is used extensively in computer languages and speech processing. However, the underlying structure of language and speech is strictly one-dimensional. The application of syntactic pattern recognition to the analysis of images requires an extension of formal language theory. Thus, this thesis extends and generalises formal language theory to apply to data that have possibly multi-dimensional underlying structure and also hierarchic structure . . . As in the case for curves, shapes are modelled as a sequence of local relationships between the curves, and these are estimated using a training sample. Syntactic square detection was extremely successful &#8211; detecting 100% of squares in images containing only a single square, and over 50% of the squares in images containing ten squares highly likely to be partially or severely occluded. The detection and classification of polygons was successful, despite a tendency for occluded squares and rectangles to be confused. The algorithm also peformed well on real images containing fish. The success of the syntactic approaches for detecting edges, detecting curves and detecting, classifying and counting occluded shapes is evidence of the potential of syntactic models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition systems</field><field name="subject">Image analysis -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Syntactic models</field><field name="subject">Image analysis</field><field name="subject">Alternating algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loading and velocity generation in the high performance tennis serve</field><field name="creator">Reid, Machar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Shoulder injuries rank among the most prevalent and debilitating sustained by professional tennis players. The loads, or magnitude, location, direction, duration, frequency, variability and rate of force application, endured by tissues of the shoulder during stroke production, and more particularly the serve, are commonly implicated in shoulder joint injury (Chandler et al., 1992; McCann and Bigliani, 1994; Kibler, 1995). Indeed, past evidence points to these loads increasing along with serve velocity, as well as with varied segment use (Elliott et al., 2003). This dissertation therefore aimed to quantify hypothesised relationships between certain serve types and techniques, and shoulder joint loading among high performance able-bodied and wheelchair players. . . Of final note is that prospective 3D biomechanical examinations of shoulder joint motion in the tennis serve should consider placement of humeral triads distal to the biceps and/or triceps muscle belly. In comparison to markers placed at the mid-point of the humerus (i.e. as used in this thesis), these more distal triad positions appear to alleviate the spurious effects of soft tissue artefact thereby enhancing the accuracy of estimated long-axis rotation of the upper arm. Although the current representation of 3D humeral motion did not confound the comparisons made between serve types or techniques, it is likely that upper arm triads located just above the epicondyles of the humerus could have offered more insightful absolute comparisons to the literature. Further, the elaboration of a joint coordinate system at the shoulder to provide for the more meaningful and functional expression and interpretation of shoulder joint kinetic and kinematic data should also be central to all future, related investigative efforts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tennis injuries</field><field name="subject">Shoulder -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Tennis -- Serve -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Shoulder -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workplace formation : how secondary school students manage structured workplace learning</field><field name="creator">Putrino, Pasco John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Changes in the international and Australian economies and labour markets during the 1980s and early 1990s substantially reduced employment opportunities for young people, causing higher education participation and increased school retention rates. Schools responded to these pressures and to Government policy with the development of Vocational Education and Training (VET) programs that integrate school-based learning with industry training, resulting in rapid growth in the participation of senior secondary students in such programs in recent years. Structured Workplace Learning (SWL) is an integral part of many such programs. How students manage their learning in these new environments was the focus of this study . . . The central finding of the study was the theory of &#8216;Workplace Formation&#8217; that explains the processes students use to manage their workplace learning during the first year of workplacement. &#8216;Workplace Formation&#8217; is comprised of five categories of processes &#8211; preparing, familiarising, committing, adapting, and building. Each category is comprised of two or more processes. While students generally proceed through each category sequentially, there is a degree of overlap between them. This general sequential progression can be disrupted if circumstances change. The extent of &#8216;Workplace Formation&#8217; may vary from one student to the next. The theory of &#8216;Workplace Formation&#8217; provides a new perspective on how school students manage their learning in the workplace while still at school and adds to the theoretical literature in this field.

However, literature pertaining to its formation in the context of the commercial education industry is limited. With Singapore poised to become the education hub of Asia, this is an important area of study and formed the focus of the current research. More specifically, the research sought answers to the role of perceived service quality, customer satisfaction and commitment in word-of-mouth formation. Unlike prior studies in this area, an additional validity test was adopted for the current research that involved an examination of the extent to which the construct measures used were free of social desirability bias. Of the various customer commitment dimensions examined, the findings showed affective commitment to have the greatest impact on word-of-mouth formation. In examining how satisfaction mediated the formation of word-of-mouth, it was found that not all service quality dimensions affected satisfaction, a result that was contrary to what was expected. Particularly, it was the process-related service quality (functional service quality) that affected satisfaction. Finally, it was found that all the construct measures used for the present study were free of social desirability bias. While the study was originally planned to be conducted in one phase, this was extended to three phases following discriminant validity issues with the original measures, with a need for alternative measures to be used.

At low pH, charcoal sorbed between 10 and 60% of Cu with initial additions of 2 and 20 &#956;g Cu/g. Similarly, between 15 and 40% of Zn was sorbed by charcoal with initial additions of 5 and 40 &#956;g Zn/g. The role of surface area in sorption of elements by charcoal is clearly only one factor that is important. Charcoal aromatic and aliphatic chemical functional groups, which can be distinguished from other forms of organic matter through spectroscopic determination, are also important in charcoal&#8217;s capacity to sorb elements. Accumulation of Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Se, Mo, Ba, Au and Pb (out of a range of 29 elements) in soil charcoal, above the concentrations in the matrix soil and plant reference charcoal, was confirmed by ICP-MS analysis. Concentrations of V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ba, Au, Pb and Bi were higher in soil charcoal than in values quoted for gossans and pisolites in the field area region (Smith and Perdrix, 1983). Higher values of Au in soil charcoal were associated with considerable amounts of included clay minerals and higher values of other elements including Mo, Mn and Fe.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid soils -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- Murchison Region (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Soil absorption and adsorption</field><field name="subject">Charcoal -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Soil</field><field name="subject">Exploration</field><field name="subject">Trace elements</field><field name="subject">Charcoal</field><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studying the DNA binding of a non-covalent analogue of the trinuclear platinum anticancer agent BBR3464</field><field name="creator">Moniodis, Joseph John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Phase II clinical candidate, [(trans-Pt(NH3)2Cl)2{&#956;-trans-Pt(NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6NH2)2}]4+ (BBR3464 or 1,0,1/t,t,t) shows a unique binding profile when compared to the anticancer agent cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2] (cisplatin) and dinuclear platinum complexes of the general formula [(trans-Pt(NH3)2Cl)2(H2N(CH2)nNH2)]2+. There is evidence that the increased efficacy of 1,0,1/t,t,t results from the presence of the charged central linker, which can alter the mode of binding to DNA. This alternate binding mode may be due to an electrostatic and hydrogen bonding association of the central platinum moiety in the minor groove that occurs prior to covalent binding (termed &#8220;pre-association&#8221;) . . . This research shows that 0,0,0/t,t,t is an adequate model to study the pre-association process of 1,0,1/t,t,t and that it binds in the minor groove of DNA. Therefore it is likely that 1,0,1/t,t,t pre-associates in the minor groove of DNA prior to covalent binding. This work supports the conclusions reached in NMR studies of the binding of 1,0,1/t,t,t with the 1,4-GG sequence (Qu et al. JBIC. 8, 19-28 (2003)), which showed simultaneous binding in the major and minor groove. The findings of the current work may also explain the observed binding mode of 1,0,1/t,t,t, which can bind to DNA in both the 3',3' and 5',5' directions (Kasparkova et al. JBC. 277, 48076-48086 (2002)). These unique binding characteristics are thought to be responsible for the increased efficacy of 1,0,1/t,t,t, and in light of the current results the observed binding mode most likely stems from the electrostatic pre-association of the central platinum moiety.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Antineoplastic agents</field><field name="subject">Platinum compounds -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular modelling and NMR studies of multinuclear platinum anticancer complexes</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Donald S</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The trinuclear anti-cancer agent [(trans-Pt(NH3)3Cl)2{&#956;-trans-Pt(NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6NH2)2}]4+ (BBR3464 or 1,0,1/t,t,t) is arguably the most significant development in the field of platinum anti-cancer agents since the discovery of cisplatin as a clinical agent more than 30 years ago. Professor Nicholas Farrell of Virginia Commonwealth University was responsible for the development of 1,0,1/t,t,t and an entire class of multinuclear platinum complexes. The paradigm shift that was required in the development of these compounds is based on a simple idea. In order to increase the functionality of platinum anti-cancer drugs a new way of binding to DNA must be employed. By increasing the number of platinum centres in the molecule and separating the binding sites, by locating them on the terminal platinum atoms, the result is a new binding motif that does not occur with cisplatin. The work described in this thesis involves the use of [&#185;H,&amp;sup15N] NMR spectroscopy combined with molecular modelling to investigate various aspects of the solution chemistry and DNA binding interactions of BBR3464 and the related dinuclear analogues [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2(&#956;- NH2(CH2)6NH2)]2+ (1,1/t,t) and [{cis-PtCl(NH3)2}2(&#956;-NH2(CH2)6NH2)]2+ (1,1/c,c). Chapter 2 contains detailed descriptions of the various methodologies used, including the molecular mechanics parameters that were developed for the various modelling studies described in this thesis.... The work described in Chapter 6 employed three duplexes; 5'-d(TCTCCTATTCGCTTATCTCTC)-3'&#183;5'- d(GAGAGATAAGCGAATAGGAGA)-3' (VB12), 5'-d(TCTCCTTCTTGTTCTTCCTCC)- 3'&#183;5'-d(GGATTAAGAACAAGAAGGAGA)-3' (VB14) and 5'- d(CTCTCTCTATTGTTATCTCTTCT)-3'&#183;5'-d(AGAAGAGATAACTATAGAGAGAG)-3' (VB16). Two minor groove preassociated forms of 1,0,1/t,t,t with each duplex were created in which the complex was orientated in two different directions around the central guanine (labelled the 3'&#8594;3' and 5'&#8594;5' directions). The molecular dynamics simulations of these six systems indicated that each preassociated states was stable within the minor groove and could effectively support the formation of multiple interstrand cross-links. Subsequent investigations into the dynamic nature of the monofunctional adduct were conducted by the assembly of a single monofunctional adduct of the VB14 duplex with 1,0,1/t,t,t. Here it was found that the monofunctionally anchored 1,0,1/t,t,t adopted a position along the phosphate backbone of the duplex in the 5'&#8594;5' direction.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Antineoplastic agents</field><field name="subject">Platinum compounds -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Platinum anticancer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managers' and facilitators' perceptions of effective group facilitation</field><field name="creator">Wardale, Dorothy</field><field name="description">This research examines managers&#8217; and facilitators&#8217; perceptions of effective facilitation. A review of the literature revealed that practitioners have written much of the existing information regarding the practice of facilitation. There has been little validation of findings by independent researchers and little empirical research. None of the claimed outcomes on facilitation effectiveness had been confirmed by managers. Further, where research had been conducted it had focused on immediate, rather than longer term issues and outcomes. This research seeks to rectify the lack of robust research into perceptions of effective facilitation by both the facilitators involved and the managers who seek to use facilitators. In this research 40 people were individually interviewed: 20 managers and 20 facilitators. Interviewees were asked to comment on both their positive and negative experiences of facilitation. The data was transcribed and QSR NVivo was used to assist with the analysis. Combinations of a priori and inductive codes were used to analyse the data. The a priori model (Brinkerhoff, 1986) had six stages, namely: Goal Setting and Needs Analysis; Program Design; Intervention; Immediate Outcomes; Intermediate or Usage Outcomes; and Impacts on the Organisation. It was found that only four of the six stages were helpful in explaining perceptions of effective facilitation; and additional themes emerged that did not fit within this predetermined model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication in personnel management</field><field name="subject">Teams in the workplace</field><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Interactive management</field><field name="subject">Personnel management</field><field name="subject">Group facilitation</field><field name="subject">Facilitation</field><field name="subject">Internal facilitator</field><field name="subject">External facilitator</field><field name="subject">Effective facilitation</field><field name="subject">Managers</field><field name="subject">Arts managers</field><field name="subject">Law managers</field><field name="subject">Public sector managers</field><field name="subject">Insurance managers</field><field name="subject">Mining managers</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular study of the forensically important calliphoridae (diptera) : implications and applications for the future of forensic entomology</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Michelle</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A common application of forensic entomology is the estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). This is most frequently estimated from the age of calliphorid specimens collected from a corpse, and in many cases it is the immature stages that are encountered. A critical step in the estimation of PMI is the accurate identification of insects to species level, with misidentification potentially resulting in the application of unsuitable developmental data and therefore inaccuracy in the resulting estimate. Identification has long been attempted on a morphological basis, but complicated by the lack of larval keys to the Calliphoridae, limited diagnostic features in immature stages and the poor preservation of specimens. Standard practice in forensic entomology is the rearing of immatures collected from the corpse through to the more distinctive adult stages, however this process is time-consuming and may be hindered where specimens die during rearing. Furthermore, many cases are presented for forensic entomologist as an afterthought and specimens are already preserved. Consequently, a new approach to the identification of calliphorids is sought which will overcome the problems of the morphological and rearing methods. ... The culmination of this study is the consideration of applications of molecular data to forensic entomology. A sequence-specific priming (SSP) technique is presented for the identification of the forensically significant calliphorids of Australia and New Zealand, along with a new method for the extraction and storage of calliphorid DNA samples using Whatman FTA cards. These techniques will potentially improve the efficiency and accuracy of identification in the estimation of PMI using calliphorids. The use of calliphorid DNA is not limited to PMI estimation, but may also be applied to museum studies. DNA was extracted from pupal casings from 300 year old mummified corpses, however difficulty was encountered in amplifying the DNA reproducibly. This illustrates however, the wide-ranging implications of the calliphorid sequence data gathered in this study. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the consideration of the status of some global calliphorid species. The new technique presented for identification of Australian and New Zealand species is the culmination of an important body of data that will ultimately contribute to the strong foundation of forensic entomology and our future accuracy, efficiency and utility as a routine investigative tool.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic entomology</field><field name="subject">Postmortem changes</field><field name="subject">Death -- Time of</field><field name="subject">Calliphora -- Larvae</field><field name="subject">Calliphoridae</field><field name="subject">Molecular identification</field><field name="subject">Postmortem interval</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of CeO?, Sm?O? and Sm-doped CeO? nanoparticles with unique morphologies</field><field name="creator">Bugayeva, Natalia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This work was concerned with investigations into the synthesis of Ce(OH)4, Sm(OH)3 and hydrated Ce-Sm mixed oxide nanoparticles with anisotropic morphologies via a chemical precipitation technique. The effect of various experimental parameters including temperature, aging time, ionic environment and thermal treatment on the morphology, structure of nanoparticles as well as elemental homogeneity of the mixed oxide nanoparticles was emphasised. It was shown that different experimental conditions resulted in different particle morphologies. This suggested that by tuning experimental parameters an ultimate goal of nanotechnology, the formation of nanoparticles with desired morphologies and sizes, may be achieved. It was found that by modifying experimental parameters it was possible to influence the development of various morphological and structural characteristics of Ce(OH)4 nanoparticles. The resulting morphologies were fibrous needle-like, rod-like and nanowire particles of various sizes. Characterisation of the nanoparticles was conducted through analysis by X-ray diffraction, surface area analysis and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Investigations into the structure of the hydrated CeO2 nanoparticles were undertaken since it is considered to be a key to the relevant properties of the material. The structure was found to exhibit multiple twinning phenomenon with 5-fold symmetry, with a consequence that  atomic planes formed the particle surface. However, upon thermal treatment of needle-like particles, structural transformation was observed that possibly led to the development of more reactive  and  particle circumferential facets. A structural model and formation mechanism of such structures was proposed. ... A preliminary study into suitability of particle anisotropic morphology for compaction and densification processes was undertaken. Investigations into the sintering behaviour of the particles with anisotropic morphology were conducted on ceria nanoneedles. It was found that these particles displayed favourable sintering characteristics. The final densities of the hydrated ceria needle-like particle samples were achieved as high as 94.1% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1100&#176;C for 5 hours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rare earths</field><field name="subject">Cerium -- Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Cerium group -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Chemical precipitation</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Ceria</field><field name="subject">Samarium doped ceria</field><field name="subject">Lanthanide series</field><field name="subject">HRTEM</field><field name="subject">Nanorods</field><field name="subject">Nanowires</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen bonding</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bisimulation quantifiers for modal logics</field><field name="creator">French, Timothy Noel</field><field name="description">Modal logics have found applications in many diferent contexts.

However, pure modal logic is expressively weak and cannot represent many interesting secondorder properties that are expressible, for example, in the &#956;-calculus. Here we investigate the extension of modal logics with propositional quantification modulo bisimulation (bisimulation quantification). We extend existing work on bisimulation quantified modal logic by considering the variety of logics that result by restricting the structures over which they are interpreted. We show this can be a natural extension of modal logic preserving the intuitions of both modal logic and propositional quantification. However, we also  find cases where such intuitions are not preserved. We examine cases where the axioms of pure modal logic and propositional quantification are preserved and where bisimulation quantifiers preserve the decidability of modal logic. We translate a number of recent decidability results for monadic second-order logics into the context of bisimulation quantified modal logics, and show how these results can be used to generate a number of interesting bisimulation quantified modal logics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Logic, Symbolic and mathematical</field><field name="subject">Automatic theorem proving</field><field name="subject">Modality (Logic)</field><field name="subject">Modal logic</field><field name="subject">Bisimulation quantifier</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subnational economic development in federal systems : the case of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Kevin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The objectives of this study are threefold: Firstly, to consider the relevance (to subnational state development) and adaptability (to globalisation) of federalism from a Western Australian perspective.

Finally, it proposes alternative mechanisms for guiding long-term economic development policy decision-making in Western Australia. This final objective is addressed in light of the findings of the first two. It is recognised that incremental changes are possible in full knowledge of the embedded nature of the policy-making process in Western Australia . . . In the case of Western Australia, subnational autonomy does not herald the end of the nationstate so much as a new stage in globalisation. In terms of how the Western Australian State Government attracts capital and labour investment, its history as an independent colony and its physical isolation from the other colonies have created the initial conditions that frame the policy-making process, which includes a set of drivers influencing the decisions that are made by State agents. Overall, the State Government continues to reinforce the State&#8217;s role as a peripheral resource supplier to the national and global political economy.

For device applications in radiation environments, such as space electronics, GaN-based devices are expected to manifest superior radiation hardness and reliability without the need for cumber- some and expensive cooling systems and/or radiation shielding.

While the irradiation-induced effects on device threshold voltage could be regarded as relatively benign (taking into account that the irradiation levels employed in this study are equivalent to more than 60 years exposure at the average ionising dose rate levels present in space missions), the observed device instabilities and the degradation of gate current characteristics are deleterious effects which will have a significant impact on the performance of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs operating in radiation environments at low temperatures, a combination of conditions which are found in spaceborne electronic systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic apparatus and appliances</field><field name="subject">Gallium alloys</field><field name="subject">Semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Gallium nitride -- Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Diodes, Schottky-barrier</field><field name="subject">Electroluminescent devices -- Materials</field><field name="subject">Gallium nitride</field><field name="subject">Gallium nitride</field><field name="subject">Charge trapping</field><field name="subject">Defect-related effects</field><field name="subject">Radiation effects</field><field name="subject">High electron mobility transistor</field><field name="subject">Schottky barrier diode</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemical constraints on the growth and nutrition of the seagrass Halophila ovalis in the Swan River Estuary</field><field name="creator">Kilminster, Kieryn Lee</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Biogeochemical processes in seagrass sediments influence growth and nutrition of seagrasses. This thesis investigates the below-ground interactions between biotic and abiotic factors that influence seagrass nutrition and growth, with focus on a small species of seagrass, Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook &#402;., from the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia. Seagrass showed significantly lower growth and an increase in leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations with increased organic matter loading. With maximal light reduction, lower growth rates and average leaf weights were observed, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were higher. Light reduction was also shown to increase bioavailability of inorganic nutrients within porewater of seagrass sediment . . . Sulphide was hypothesised to have an inhibitory effect on nutrient uptake of Halophila ovalis. Below-ground sulphide inhibits the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II at sulphide concentrations greater than 1 mM. Sulphide exposure enhanced phosphate uptake, with no significant effect on ammonium uptake of H. ovalis. This thesis demonstrates that biogeochemical processes both constrain the potential growth of seagrasses and influence the nutrient status of seagrass tissue. Consideration of the influence of sulphide stress on seagrasses is likely to be particularly important for anthropogenically influenced aquatic systems, where inputs of organic matter are enriched relative to pristine ecosystems.

The Common Mechanism Account proposes that cognitive biases represent concurrent manifestations of a single underlying selective processing mechanism.

There has been interest in the ability of dietary derived nutrients such as vitamin E, to act as antioxidants and protect against atherosclerosis. Despite promising epidemiological data which suggested benefits from a higher intake of &amp;alpha-tocopherol (&amp;alphaT), one of the major forms of dietary vitamin E, for protection against atherosclerosis, large scale, randomised controlled trials have generally shown no protective effect of high dose &amp;alphaT supplementation. Recent studies suggest that the other major dietary tocopherol isomer, &amp;gamma-tocopherol (&amp;gammaT), may possess biological activities not shared by &amp;alphaT. Supplementation with &amp;gammaT, or mixtures of tocopherols rich in &amp;gammaT, have shown biological activities that may help protect against atherosclerosis. The aim of this PhD project is to further characterise the biological relevance of ?T for protection against CVD...   Both ?- and mixed tocopherol supplementation resulted in reduced plasma F2-isoprostanes (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) but did not affect 24 hour urinary F2-isoprostanes and erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities. Neither &amp;alphaT nor mixed tocopherol supplementation affected any measured plasma markers of inflammation. The tocopherol supplementation also did not affect COX-2 activity as assessed by 14 stimulated whole blood prostaglandin E2 synthesis, and urinary prostacyclin metabolite output. Compared to the placebo group, stimulated neutrophil leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production decreased significantly in the mixed tocopherol group (P=0.02) but not in the &amp;alphaT group (P=0.15). The ability of both pure &amp;alphaT and mixed tocopherol supplementation to reduce systemic lipid peroxidation in patients with type 2 diabetes, suggests potential benefits of vitamin E supplementation in this population. However, despite decreasing oxidative stress, our results also suggests that in populations with well controlled type 2 diabetes, supplementation with either &amp;alphaT, or mixed tocopherol rich in &amp;gammaT, is unlikely to confer further benefits in reducing systemic inflammation. Future research into the possible unique biological activity of different tocopherol isomers other than &amp;alphaT, for example, their ability to affect the 5-LO pathway and production of inflammatory mediators such as LTB4, is warranted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E in animal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease</field><field name="subject">Vitamin E</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of putative transporters maintaining iron homeostasis in symbiotic soybeans</field><field name="creator">Castelli, Joanne Maree</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Nitrogen fixation is a feature of the symbiotic association between legumes and rhizobia, which occurs within the symbiosomes of root nodules and involves the conversion of atmospheric N2 to ammonia to be used by the plant in exchange for carbon compounds. Exchange of other nutrients is controlled by plant-synthesised proteins on the symbiosome membrane. Iron is a component of symbiotically important proteins, so is essential for nitrogen fixation. Low soil iron leads to decreased plant yields, whilst in other environments plants may accumulate iron to toxic levels. Knowledge of iron acquisition, transport and storage mechanisms is important to elucidate the role of iron transporters in the maintenance of iron homeostasis in the plant. This study provides evidence that iron has a profound effect in the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-Glycine max symbiosis on the development of the nodule, and on the development of the symbiotic soybean plant itself. cDNAs encoding four putative iron transporters in soybean; GmDmt1, GmYSL1, GmCCC1;1 and GmCCC1;2, were identified, isolated and characterised in this study. GmDmt1 is localised to the symbiosome membrane. Expression of GmDmt1 occurs in nodules, roots and leaves and increases in response to iron starvation. GmDmt1 rescues growth and enhances 55Fe(II) uptake in the iron transport deficient yeast strain fet3fet4, with uptake following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, resembling the situation in isolated symbiosomes. Competition experiments using fet3fet4 indicated that GmDmt1 is able to transport other divalent cations, including zinc, copper and manganese, and is also able to complement a zinc transport deficient yeast mutant.  ... These results suggest the divalent metal transporter GmDmt1, the putative iron chelate transporter GmYSL1 and the putative vacuolar iron transporters GmCCC1;1 and GmCCC1;2 act together to maintain iron homeostasis in symbiotic soybeans. The possible interactions and regulation of these proteins and their roles in the acquisition, transport and utilisation of iron in symbiotic soybeans are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeostasis</field><field name="subject">Iron -- Physiological transport</field><field name="subject">Soybeans</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">Iron</field><field name="subject">Transport protein</field><field name="subject">Symbiosis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the goals of small and medium enterprise owner-operations</field><field name="creator">Newby, Rick</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The focus of this thesis is to investigate the meaning and measurement of business success for owner-operators of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Taking a first step towards a greater understanding of SME performance, the study develops an instrument specifically designed to measure the business goals and objectives of SME owners. This development is based on a combination of a: literature search; quantitative analysis of a secondary data set of the goals and expectations of Australian retailers; qualitative (focus group) study of West Australian SME principals; and quantitative (mail survey) study of West Australian SME principals. Both these primary data studies used SME principals from a wide variety of industries . . . Tests of the power of the SOS to account for differences in economic performance revealed that the SOS significantly increased understanding of variations in owner returns and profitability and had a limited capacity to explain differences in revenue growth and staff revenue productivity. SOS satisfaction was found to describe differences in owner-operators&#8217; perceptions of business success significantly better than objective measures of economic return. It is expected that such knowledge will help subsequent research develop an understanding of how SME onwer-operators modify their expectations of economic return for the utility they gain from their working life.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Success in business</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Small business -- Management</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Owner-operators</field><field name="subject">Objectives</field><field name="subject">Goals</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomical optical coherence tomography in the human upper airway</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Julian</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis describes the development, clinical validation and initial application of a technique for taking measurements of the shape and dimensions of the human upper airway, called anatomical optical coherence tomography (aOCT). The technique uses a transparent catheter containing a rotating optical probe which is introduced transnasally and positioned in the airway and oesophagus. Optical coherence tomography is used to take calibrated cross-sectional images of the airway lumen as the probe rotates. The probe can also be advanced or withdrawn within the catheter during scanning to build up three-dimensional information. The catheter remains stationary so that the subject is not aware of the probe motion. The initial application of the system is research into obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a serious condition characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep and an independent risk factor for deaths by heart disease, strokes or car accidents. Measurement of upper airway size and shape is important for the investigation of the pathophysiology of OSA, and for the development and assesment of new treatments. . . We have used aOCT to capture three-dimensional data sets of the airway shape from upper oesophagus to the nasal cavity, undertaken measurements of compliance and other airway characteristics, and recorded dynamic airway shape during confirmed sleep apnoea events in a hospital sleep laboratory. We have shown that aOCT generates quantitative, real-time measurements of upper airway size and shape, allowing study over lengthy periods during both sleep and wakefulness. These features should make it useful for study of upper airway behavior to investigate OSA pathophysiology, and aid clinical management and treatment development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Airway (Medicine)</field><field name="subject">Respiratory organs</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic imaging</field><field name="subject">Optical tomography</field><field name="subject">Coherence (Optics)</field><field name="subject">Optical coherence tomography</field><field name="subject">Optical ranging</field><field name="subject">Biomedical optics</field><field name="subject">Upper airway</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of novel genes associated with allergen-driven T cell activation in human atopics</field><field name="creator">Bosco, Anthony</field><field name="description">[ Truncated abstract ]  Atopic diseases such as asthma are thought to be driven to a significant extent by T helper memory cells which are programmed to respond in a harmful way to environmental allergens (e.g. house dust mite). Previous studies in humans and in animal models have established that activation of TH2 cytokine genes in T memory responses to allergens is central to the disease process. However, only a subset of atopics harbouring a TH2-memory response phenotype manifests clinical symptoms of disease. Moreover, clinical trials with TH2 antagonists in atopic patients have proven disappointing, suggesting underlying complexities in disease pathogenesis which escape regulation via these approaches. It was thus hypothesised that additional genes involved in the activation program of allergen-specific T memory cells which are central to disease pathogenesis remain unidentified. The aim of the current study was to identify such novel genes by applying microarray technology to survey genome-wide expression patterns in an in vitro model of allergen-driven human T cell activation. In contrast to previous human microarray studies in this area focusing on mitogen activated T cell lines and clones, the current study avoided the use of strong activation stimuli which have the potential to distort patterns of gene expression, and reports for the first time the findings of microarray analysis of house dust mite allergen-driven acute gene activation in recirculating T memory cells harvested from the peripheral blood of human atopics. ... Finally, methodology was established to investigate the function of the novel atopy-associated genes. In loss-of-function experiments, expression of DACT1 and CAMK2D was silenced in primary T cell responses driven by bacterial superantigens, a model system for studying T cell responses under conditions which mimic antigen-specific activation. Whilst silencing DACT1 and CAMK2D expression did not influence classical readouts of T cell function including proliferation and cytokine production, microarray profiling was employed to identify putative downstream transcriptional targets of each gene. The experimental strategy and optimised methodology presented herein can now be employed to investigate the molecular circuitry linking the novel atopy-associated genes to the T cell activation process. In conclusion, several novel genes associated with allergen-driven T memory responses in atopics have been first described in this thesis and represent logical candidates for more detailed immunological and genetic studies related to the pathogenesis of atopic diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Allergy -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Allergy</field><field name="subject">T cell</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the informational processing paradigm to design commercial rumour response strategies on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Howell, Gwyneth Veronica James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Rumours can lead to unpredictable events: the manner in which an organisation responds to a commercial rumour can alter its reputation, and can affect its profitability as well as, ultimately, its survival. Commercial rumours are now a prominent feature of the business environment. They can emerge from organisational change, pending workforce layoffs, mergers, and changes to management, in addition, commercial rumours can lower morale and undermine productivity. There are several well-known examples of commercial rumours that have been, or continue to be, circulated. Commercial rumours are typically either about a conspiracy or contamination issue. Conspiracy rumours usually target those organisational practices or policies which are identified as undesirable by the stakeholders. This form of rumour is often precipitated by situations where people do not have all the information about a situation, for example the rumour about Proctor &amp; Gamble being run by the Moonies. Snapple, the soft drink company, was rumoured in 1992 to be supporting the Ku Klux Klan in closing abortion clinics. Contamination rumours are wide-ranging and typically have revulsion theme, such as McDonald&#8217;s "worms in the burger", Pop Rock&#8217;s candies which exploded in the stomach, and poison in Herron&#8217;s paracetamol . . .

Understanding the dynamics associated with the movement of waters between and within these systems is therefore significant in defining the ecological health of the system. An important sub category of lagoons is Intermittently Closing and Opening Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs). These systems lack any significant river inflow; have a restricted sill type inlet and experience intermittent exchange with the ocean, making them susceptible to the retention of nutrients and pollutants from the catchment. The duration and frequency of an opening event may vary from weeks to months between each ICOLL, and inter and intra annually, respectively, and during an opening event, there are appreciable fluctuations in water level (1-3m range) accompanied by large changes in salinity (7  30ppt) within a short timeframe (hours). . . Regardless of the processes complete oceanic flushing was still predicted for each system, by the end of their respective opening events. The modelling work successfully reproduced the spring tidal setup in water level and exchange, using real bathymetry and meteorological forcing and defined the spring tidal set-up as the key predictable process in the exchange of water and salt between the larger ICOLL and the ocean. It was also shown that strong winds had the capacity to influence the magnitude of the exchange. The overall outcomes of this research therefore include the identification of key physical processes associated with the variability of the hydrodynamics within and between ICOLLs, which will aid in the future management of these highly dynamic systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Lakes</field><field name="subject">ICOLLs</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Lagoons</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of mitochondria in regulating MAPK signalling pathways during oxidative stress</field><field name="creator">Pang, Wei Wei</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated to play a major role in many pathological conditions including heart attack and stroke. Their ability to modulate the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathways, thereby influencing cellular response has been well-documented. Recent studies implicate a central role for mitochondria in ERK and JNK activation by ROS although the mechanisms remained unresolved. Using Jurkat T-lymphocyte as a cell model, this study demonstrated increased mitochondrial ROS production as a result of decreased mitochondrial complex activities mediated by hydrogen peroxide treatment. This is the first study to show that mitochondria are not essential for activating ERKs, however damaged mitochondria producing ROS can be expected to cause sustained ERK activation . . . This study revealed that JNK and its upstream kinases MKK4, MKK7 and ASK1 are associated with the mitochondria. Furthermore, findings from this study imply that JNK resides in the mitochondrial matrix. This study is the first to demonstrate that mitochondrial JNK can be activated in a cell-free environment by signals originating from the mitochondria. Experimental work using isolated mitochondria demonstrated that mitochondrial JNK can be activated by ROS generated from the mitochondria themselves.

Although this process is initially compensatory, it frequently results in heart failure and death. Cardiac hypertrophy is a complex process involving changes in the individual cardiac muscle cells, cardiac myocytes. As well as the morphological changes that result from hypertrophy, there are molecular changes within each cell that regulate the hypertrophic process. These molecular changes involve many different pathways within the cardiac myocytes and remain poorly understood . . . Both STAT3&#945; and &#946; overexpression resulted in the upregulation of the VEGF, MnSOD and SOCS-3 genes. This indicates that in the heart, STAT3&#946; is able to activate the gene expression of these genes in a similar manner to STAT3&#945;. However, STAT3&#945; or &#946; activation alone is not enough to induce cardiac hypertrophy. In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis determined a novel role for ERK in the induction of cell death in the heart and revealed many changes in cardiac gene expression following ERK activation. These genes may be the mediators of ERK responses and their identification provides valuable information and direction for further research in this area. One consequence of ERK activation was the negative regulation of the STAT3 pathway. Further investigation revealed for the first time that the STAT3 proteins themselves may not be involved in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy and that STAT3&#946;, initially thought to be a transcriptional repressor, can induce the expression of genes that are known to be activated by STAT3&#945; in the heart. Therefore, these results help to better understand the roles of these two signalling pathways in the heart.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Dilatation</field><field name="subject">Cells -- Effect of drugs on</field><field name="subject">Heart failure</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">ERK MAPK signalling</field><field name="subject">STAT3 signalling</field><field name="subject">Microarray analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of numeric sub-branding on Singaporean Chinese consumers : a conjoint analysis</field><field name="creator">Tan, Donald</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It has been argued that the demand for a product is largely dependent on price and quality (Dodds, Monroe &amp; Grewal, 1991) and that it is possible to provide a global product with a universal brand, as consumers desire reliable and quality products at low prices (Levitt, 1983). As global companies extend their reach around the world and such &#8220;global&#8221; products become available world wide, it is important for marketers to understand if other factors play a significant role in consumers&#8217; purchase processes, especially in Asia where cultural and social influences can be very different from Western societies . . .

These numbers were chosen as Ang (1997) had noted the numbers represented &#8220;death&#8221; (4) and &#8220;prosperity&#8221; (8) in Chinese numerology and, consequently, may have a negative or positive impact on the value Chinese consumers attach to a product. While there are many types of products available to consumers and possible juxtapositions of numbers are almost endless, the present study was restricted to examining the impact that the numbers 4 and 8 had on the value Chinese consumers attached to cars and mobile phones to ensure the study was manageable.

Aries is comprised of a N-NNE-trending series of three diatremes and associated hypabyssal kimberlite dykes and plugs. The diatremes are volumetrically dominated by massive, clast-supported, accidental lithic-rich kimberlite breccias that were intruded by hypabyssal macrocrystic phlogopite kimberlite dykes and plugs with variably uniform- to globular segregationary-textured groundmasses. Lower diatremefacies, accidental lithic-rich breccias probably formed through fall-back of debris into the vent with a major contribution from the collapse of the vent walls. These massive breccias are overlain by a sequence of bedded volcaniclastic breccias in the upper part of the north lobe diatreme. Abundant, poorly-vesicular to nonvesicular, juvenile kimberlite ash and lapilli, with morphologies that are indicative of phreatomagmatic fragmentation processes, occur in a reversely-graded volcaniclastic kimberlite breccia unit at the base of this sequence. This unit and overlying bedded accidental lithic-rich breccias are interpreted to be sediment gravity-flow deposits (including possible debris flows) derived from the collapse of the crater walls and/or tephra ring deposits that surrounded the crater. ... This Fe-enrichment may have resulted from Fe-Mg exchange with olivine during slow cooling of the peridotite host rocks. Textures reflecting the cooling history of some mantle xenoliths are preserved in the form of fine exsolution rods of aluminous spinel in diopside and zircon in rutile grains in aluminous spinel- and rutile-bearing serpentinised ultramafic xenoliths, respectively. These textures suggest nearly isobaric cooling of host rocks in the lithospheric mantle, and indicate that at least some aluminous spinel in spinel-facies peridotites formed through exsolution from chromian 4 diopside. Episodes of Fe-Ti-rich metasomatism in the spinel-facies Kimberley mantle are the likely source of high-Ti phlogopite-biotite + rutile and Ti, V, Zn, Ni-enriched aluminous spinel &#177; ilmenite associations in several ultramafic xenoliths.

The distribution of mixotrophic cells differed across the transect. Those mixotrophs that use photosynthesis as their primarily energy source exploited nutrient limited conditions inshore consuming particles, while mixotrophs that are primarily heterotrophic survived low prey conditions offshore by photosynthesizing. In the eddies, the grazing behaviour of microzooplankton was dependent on the specific phytoplankton assemblage in each eddy. The warm core eddy had a resident population of diatoms that were consumed by heterotrophic dinoflagellates present in high numbers.

The first part of this study investigates the effect of basin-scale internal waves on the water quality parameters in Lake Burragorang, a large water supply reservoir for the city of Sydney, Australia. It is shown from field observations how the steady-state formulation of selective withdrawal can be used to predict the outflow water quality in reservoirs where internal waves are present, with a temperature prediction accuracy within 0.2 oC. . . In order to explain fluctuations in water quality parameters of the outflows, such as turbidity, it is important to know not only the stratifcation conditions in front to the offtake, but also to understand the dynamics of suspended particles in the upper reaches of the reservoir. In the third part of this study, transport and settling of suspended particles was investigated in the Wollondilly arm of Lake Burragorang by combination of direct and inverse methods. The inverse method was modifed to enable the separation of advective and diffusive transport of suspended particles from Stokes settling controlled by gravity, yielding twodimensional fields of particle velocities and settling fluxes in the upper reaches of the reservoir.

In this study we have aimed to assess the overall contribution of this gene to the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies, in cases where the most common causes of CMT disease havebeen excluded, as well as to gain clues about its function through the identification of its interactions with other proteins. Sequence analysis of NDRG1 in 104 patients with CMT disease and of diverse ethnicity identified one novel disease-causing mutation, IVS8-1G&gt;A (g.2290787G&gt;A), which affects the splice-acceptor site of IVS8 and results in the skipping of exon 9 . . .

A putative role of NDRG1 in the general mechanisms of HDL-mediated cholesterol transport was supported by biochemical studies of blood lipids, which revealed an association between the Gypsy founder mutation, R148X, and decreased HDL-C levels.

It was aimed to assess if the neuromuscular changes map over into the performance of sporting manoeuvres and if potential for loading on the ACL and risk of injury was reduced or exacerbated . . . ACL strain can be decreased through reduction in the applied loads and greater knee flexion. Further to this, muscle activation has the ability to reduce loading on the ACL through co-contraction and selective activation patterns. This thesis demonstrated differing neuromuscular adaptations from various training types that map over into the performance of sporting manoeuvres. The research indicated that the Balance-Training was the most favourable in reducing potential for injury risk on the ACL. Alternatively strength training elicited neuromuscular changes that were likely to increase the risk of force on the ACL. The Machine+Balance training resulted in some negative and positive outcomes with the balance training tending to counteract the negative affects of machine weights training resulting in small improvements in muscular support and load reduction.

In answering this question, I challenge existing interpretations and criticisms of luck egalitarianism, and highlight its radical consequences. I propose a revised theory of luck egalitarianism, and conclude that it does represent a compelling interpretation of egalitarian justice. In the first chapter, I trace the evolution of luck egalitarianism, highlighting the variety of theories that have been grouped under this label. In chapter 2, I defend the approach against an influential critique by Elizabeth Anderson, who argues that luck egalitarianism is inherently disrespectful, trapped in the distributive paradigm, and harsh in its approach towards the victims of bad option luck. I argue against these criticisms, pointing out that the harsh treatment problem will rarely arise because few inequalities result entirely from option luck, and that luck egalitarianism is not disrespectful to those it seeks to assist, nor trapped in the distributive paradigm. In chapter 3, I analyse the distinction between option luck and brute luck, which is crucial to luck egalitarianism. I argue that the option-brute distinction is inconsistent with the underlying impulse of luck egalitarianism because it allows morally arbitrary inequalities to go uncorrected and because it is insufficiently sensitive to the impact of background inequalities on individual choice. I propose a revised theory of luck egalitarianism that focuses on the extent to which a person's level of advantage has been genuinely chosen, rejecting the option-brute distinction. In chapter 4, I give a broader justification of this theory, analysing recent critiques by Susan Hurley and Samuel Scheffler, who have both questioned the moral foundations of luck egalitarianism. In chapter 5, I outline a conception of egalitarian advantage to work alongside the revised theory of luck egalitarianism. I support Cohen's claim that egalitarians should adopt a heterogeneous account of advantage, which includes resources, welfare, and midfare. ...  In chapter 7, I highlight the counter-intuitive social policy applications of luck egalitarianism, arguing that the universal approach to social provision associated with the social democratic welfare state comes closer to achieving luck-egalitarian objectives than the residual and conditional provision of benefits and services that is associated with the liberal welfare state. I conclude that luck egalitarianism, in the revised form I outline in chapter 3, is a compelling interpretation of egalitarian justice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Social justice</field><field name="subject">Equality -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Social ethics</field><field name="subject">Fortune -- Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Distributive justice</field><field name="subject">Luck egalitarianism</field><field name="subject">Egalitarian justice</field><field name="subject">Opinion luck</field><field name="subject">Brute luck</field><field name="subject">Choice</field><field name="subject">Responsibility</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activity-based knowledge contexts : an exploration of Niklas Luhmann's autopoietic social theories for knowledge management practice and systems</field><field name="creator">Young, Regit</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The dominant approaches to knowledge management practice and the design of knowledge management systems are driven by a resource-based view of knowledge. In this thesis, it is argued that the resource-based view of knowledge is limited and lacks social sensitivity. In this thesis, Knowledge Management is viewed as a social activity and the development and examination of an alternate approach to conceptualising the social processes of knowledge management in organisations, is the primary objective. In pursuing this objective, the question of whether an activity-based view of knowledge processes can assist the design of knowledge management practice and systems is examined. To address this research question, a conceptual framework is developed which redefines the conventional, universal approach to knowledge context . . . From an organisational perspective, the ABCs framework suggests that the institutionalisation and contextualisation of knowledge provides management with another dimension for considering knowledge management and knowledge management systems implementation. The findings from the case study suggest that knowledge workers are influenced by environmental factors. As a result, organisations can use this research to develop knowledge management practices that take environmental factors into consideration. As a starting point for organisations, the findings from the case studies are used to develop a set of guidelines for the design of knowledge management practice and systems.

It encompasses the Paul Keating years (1991 to 1996) as well as John Howard&#8217;s three consecutive terms as Prime Minister (from 1996 to 2004). As a consequence of events unfolding in this period of time, the thesis does not consider Australian foreign policy towards East Timor beyond the 1999 referendum that resulted in the separation of East Timor from Indonesia and focuses on Papua until 2004. The primary empirical aim of this thesis is to compare and contrast the two administrations&#8217; approaches and responses to human rights abuses in East Timor and Papua. Drawing upon a variety of theoretical concepts in human rights and foreign policy, this thesis shows that incorporating a concern for human rights in the foreign policy making process is problematic because the promotion of human rights often comes into conflict with other foreign policy objectives . . . The two case studies on human rights abuses in East Timor and Papua reflect the tensions between concepts of realism and idealism in Australian foreign policy. However, the situation of East Timor shows that public pressure is required to balance the disparity of national interest and human rights. The role of public pressure has been largely absent in debates on human rights and foreign policy. While this study focuses on East Timor and Papua as case studies, the discussion of the findings has far reaching implications for Australian foreign policy and international relations, especially concerning the scholarly debate over the place of human rights in foreign policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights -- Australia</field><field name="subject">International relations</field><field name="subject">East Timor -- Foreign relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Papua (Indonesia) -- Foreign relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Foreign relations -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Indonesia -- Foreign relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Foreign policy</field><field name="subject">Australia-Indonesia relations</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Papua</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-temperature micro-opto-electro-mechanical technologies for temperature sensitive substrates</field><field name="creator">Martyniuk, Mariusz</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The salient feature of next generation infrared (IR) on-chip integrated sensors is likely to be sensitivity in a narrow wavelength band that is tuneable over a selected range of the IR spectrum. It is proposed that this can be achieved by the integration of present-day HgCdTe IR detectors with thin-film based microelectro- mechanical systems (MEMS) optical mirror technology. Narrow-band sensitivity is obtained by optical resonance phenomena within a Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity, that is created by two Bragg reflectors and is monolithically integrated with an HgCdTe IR detector. Electrostatic actuation of the thin-film membrane supported Bragg reflector is the means of providing wavelength discrimination of the incident IR photons which, for example, could be used for target discrimination or detection of various chemical/biological species via identification of narrow spectral features . . . The outcomes from this thesis have been incorporated into a monolithic integrated technology comprising low-temperature MEMS and HgCdTe IR detector technology. The integrated technology has been shown to be viable, and successful prototypes have been fabricated. Structural properties of the SiNx, SiOx, and Ge layers encompassed in the suspended IR reflector have allowed for IR photon detection in a narrow wavelength band with full-width at halfmaximum of &#8764;100nm that is tunable over a wavelength range from 2.2 to 1.85&#956;m using a maximum tuning voltage of only 7.5V.

Study one was performed to determine if there were differences in muscle buffer capacity (&#946;min-vitro) between females of differing training status (i.e., team-sport, endurance-trained and untrained subjects). Studies two and three were then performed to determine if short-term training could improve muscle buffer capacity and what type of training best improves this muscle characteristic (i.e., high-intensity, moderate-intensity or resistance training). Studies four and five were performed to determine if the accumulation of H+ during exercise was a mechanism by which training improved muscle buffer capacity. Below is a summary of these five studies. Study 1. The team-sport group had a significantly higher &#946;min-vitro than either the endurance-trained or the untrained groups (181 &#177; 27 v 148 &#177; 11 v 122 &#177; 32 'mol H+?g dm-1?pH-1 respectively; P&lt;0.05). The team-sport group also completed significantly more relative total work (299 &#177; 27 v 263 &#177; 31 v 223 &#177; 21 J?kg-1, respectively; P&lt;0.05) and absolute total work (18.2 &#177; 1.6 v 14.6 &#177; 2.4 v 13.0 &#177; 1.9 kJ, respectively; P&lt;0.05) than the endurance-trained or untrained groups during a repeated sprint ability (RSA) test. There was a significant correlation between &#946;min-vitro and RSA (r=0.67; P&lt;0.05). These findings show that young females competing in team sports have a larger &#946;min-vitro than either endurance-trained or untrained females. This may be the result of the intermittent, high-intensity activity during training and the match play of team-sport athletes... Conclusions. Our results show that training intensity is an important determinant of muscle buffer capacity. High-intensity interval training (120-150% LT) improved muscle buffer capacity (9  27%), however, neither moderate-intensity or resistance training improved muscle buffer capacity. In contrast higher training intensity (150-180% LT) may negatively affect muscle buffer capacity. Differences in the accumulation of H+ during high-intensity interval training does not appear to be the underlying mechanism for changes to muscle buffer capacity, however changes to this muscle characteristic were associated with pre-training muscle buffer capacity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Physical education and training -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen ion regulation</field><field name="subject">Interval training</field><field name="subject">Buffer capacity</field><field name="subject">Repeated prints</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of locomotion in Australian Varanid lizards (Reptilia: Squamata: Varanidae) : ecomorphological and ecophysiological considerations</field><field name="creator">Clemente, Christofer</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In ecomorphological or ecophysiological studies, variation in `design? traits (e.g. size, morphology and physiology) is thought to determine variation in ecologically-relevant performance traits, which in turn determines fitness in a particular habitat (Arnold 1983). Thus, natural selection is thought to act most directly on intermediate traits such as measures of locomotory performance. This thesis examined this process in the closely related group of Australian varanids lizards (Squamata: Varanidae). Phylogenetically, varanids are divided into three major clades. Size (mass and snout-to-vent length) is strongly correlated with these three clades. Two clades, (Gouldii and Komodoensis) are large, while the third clade (Odatria) has a smaller body size. Thus, there is considerable variation in size for various species. Size varied for species by three orders of magnitude. Size is also related to two ecological characteristics, foraging mode and habitat openness. Widely-foraging species were larger than sit-and-wait strategists, while species from open habitats were larger than species from semi-open or closed habitats. However, given the tight link between size and phylogeny we cannot separate adaptation of size to ecological traits from that of phylogenetic patterns. Of interest throughout this thesis was how variations in design (e.g. morphology and physiology) were related to ecological characteristics. Since body size also influences many of these morphological and physiological characteristics it is often necessary to remove the effects of size. Three design traits were examined in detail: body dimensions, vertebral number and metabolic rates. &#8230;Curiously, no performance variable linked differences in size-free body dimensions to retreat sites. This suggests that there is either a direct link between design and ecology (e.g. dorso-ventral compression), or some unmeasured performance variable related to retreat site. Given that most performance traits are thought to involve kinematic movements of the hindlimb limb and pelvis, and these were not best related to retreat site, then a direct link between design and ecology with respect to retreat site seems possible. In summary, this thesis provides evidence not only for links between design and ecology mediated by locomotory performance traits, but also direct links between design and ecology, for Australian varanid lizards.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monitor lizards -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Monitor lizards -- Locomotion</field><field name="subject">Monitor lizards -- Evolution</field><field name="subject">Monitor lizards -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Varanids</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observations of energy transfer mechanisms associated with internal waves</field><field name="creator">Gomez Giraldo, Evelio Andres</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Internal waves redistribute energy and momentum in stratified lakes and constitute the path through which the energy that is introduced at the lake scale is cascaded down to the turbulent scales where mixing and dissipation take place. This research, based on intensive field data complemented with numerical simulations, covers several aspects of the energy flux path ranging from basin-scale waves with periods of several hours to high frequency waves with periods of few minutes. It was found that, at the basin-scale level, the horizontal shape of the lake at the level of the metalimnion controls the period and modal structure of the basin-scale natural modes, conforming to the dispersion relationship of internal waves in circular basins. The sloping bottom, in turn, produces local intensification of the wave motion due to focusing of internal wave rays over near-critical slopes, providing hot spots for the degeneration of the basin-scale waves due to shear instabilities, nonlinear processes and dissipation. Different types of high-frequency phenomena were observed in a stratified lake under different forcing conditions. The identification of the generation mechanisms revealed how these waves extract energy from the mean flow and the basin-scale waves. The changes to the stratification show that such waves contribute to mixing in different ways . . . Detailed field observations were used to develop a comprehensive description of an undocumented energy flux mechanism in which shear-instabilities with significant amplitudes away from the generation level are produced in the surface layer due to the shear generated by the wind. The vertical structure of these instabilities is such that the growing wave-related fluctuations strain the density field in the metalimnion triggering secondary instabilities. These instabilities also transport energy vertically to the thermocline where they transfer energy back to the mean flow through interaction with the background shear.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy transfer</field><field name="subject">Stratified flow</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Water waves</field><field name="subject">Lakes</field><field name="subject">Internal waves</field><field name="subject">Internal waves</field><field name="subject">Physical limnology</field><field name="subject">Stratified lakes</field><field name="subject">Natural modes</field><field name="subject">Shear instability</field><field name="subject">Energy transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations and matching techniques for 3D free-form object and face recognition</field><field name="creator">Mian, Ajmal Saeed</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The aim of visual recognition is to identify objects in a scene and estimate their pose. Object recognition from 2D images is sensitive to illumination, pose, clutter and occlusions. Object recognition from range data on the other hand does not suffer from these limitations. An important paradigm of recognition is model-based whereby 3D models of objects are constructed offline and saved in a database, using a suitable representation. During online recognition, a similar representation of a scene is matched with the database for recognizing objects present in the scene . . . The tensor representation is extended to automatic and pose invariant 3D face recognition. As the face is a non-rigid object, expressions can significantly change its 3D shape. Therefore, the last part of this thesis investigates representations and matching techniques for automatic 3D face recognition which are robust to facial expressions. A number of novelties are proposed in this area along with their extensive experimental validation using the largest available 3D face database. These novelties include a region-based matching algorithm for 3D face recognition, a 2D and 3D multimodal hybrid face recognition algorithm, fully automatic 3D nose ridge detection, fully automatic normalization of 3D and 2D faces, a low cost rejection classifier based on a novel Spherical Face Representation, and finally, automatic segmentation of the expression insensitive regions of a face.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Human face recognition (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">3D object recognition</field><field name="subject">3D shape representation</field><field name="subject">3D face recognition</field><field name="subject">3D modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary dynamics in ephemeral pools : inferences from genetic architecture of large branchiopods</field><field name="creator">Zofkova, Magdalena</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] I have evaluated the effects of different types of ephemeral pools on the evolutionary dynamics of two large branchiopods in Australia, the clam shrimp Lynceus and the fairy shrimp Branchinella longirostris. Both shrimps are passive dispersers, relying on their sexually produced resting eggs for continuity of populations in time and space, although their actual dispersal ability remains speculative. The two currently recognised species of the genus Lynceus (L. tatei and L. macleyanus) are widespread across Australia, and they occupy a wide range of ephemeral fresh water habitats, while the fairy shrimp Branchinella longirostris is endemic to rock pools on granite outcrops in south-western Australia. Samples of populations were collected from a total of 96 ephemeral pools at 80 locations in New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia . . . This highlighted the contrast between the two species and their microhabitats, and implied that these microhabitats offered different opportunities for dispersal. These were identified as frequent disturbances of the clam shrimp&#8217;s egg-banks due to &#8216;wash-out&#8217; effects during heavy rains and animal and human vectors attracted by the water stored in the deep pools. My comparative study shows that the difference in evolutionary dynamics observed between the two species was a consequence of their environmental interactions rather than of the microhabitats themselves. Similar to patterns detected in other passive dispersers with disjunct population distribution, evolutionary dynamics in Lynceus and B. longirostris seem to be a result of complex interactions among gene flow, population histories and ecology of their habitat. The results contribute to the emerging evidence that branchiopod crustaceans are poor dispersers and highlight the importance of local context in determining evolutionary processes within species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fairy shrimps -- Australia -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Fairy shrimps -- Australia -- Classification</field><field name="subject">Branchiopoda -- Australia -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Branchiopoda -- Australia -- Classification</field><field name="subject">Pond ecology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">Phylogeography</field><field name="subject">Large branchiopods</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A torso driven walking algorithm for dynamically balanced variable speed biped robots</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Alistair James</field><field name="description">As a contribution toward the objective of developing useful walking machines, this dissertation considers solutions to some of the problems involved with bipedal robot development. The main area of focus involves control system design and implementation for dynamically balanced walking robots. A new algorithm &#8220;Torso Driven Walking&#8221; is presented, which reduces the complexity of the control problem to that of balancing the robot&#8217;s torso. All other aspects of the system are indirectly controlled by the changing robot state resulting from direct control of the robot&#8217;s torso. The result is literally a &#8220;top-down&#8221; approach to control, where the control system actively balances the top-most component of the robot&#8217;s body, leaving the control of the lower limbs to a passive &#8220;state-driven&#8221; system designed to ensure the robot always keeps at least one leg between the torso and the ground. A series of low-cost robots and simulation systems have been constructed as experimental platforms for testing the proposed new control system. The robots have been designed to balance on &#8220;point&#8221; feet, and so the control system must be able to dynamically maintain balance, while moving at a variable velocity. The Torso Driven Walking control system achieves a fully dynamic, variable speed walking behaviour that does not rely on maintaining a stable supporting polygon for balance. In addition, the system exhibits a high degree of tolerance for low frequency &#8220;bias&#8221; or &#8220;drift&#8221; errors. These measurement errors are commonly encountered when using sensors for detecting torso inclination.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent control systems</field><field name="subject">Robots -- Motion</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">Robotic walking</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of soluble organic carbon substrates, and environmental modulators on soil microbial function and diversity</field><field name="creator">Hoyle, Frances Carmen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The principal aim of this thesis was to examine the response of the microbial community to the addition of small amounts (&lt;50 &#956;g C g-1 soil) of organic C substrates (&#8216;trigger molecules&#8217;) to soil. This addition is comparative to indigenous soluble C concentrations for a range of soil types in Western Australia (typically measured between 20 and 55 &#956;g C g-1 soil). Previously it has been reported that the application of trigger molecules to European soils has caused more CO2-C to be evolved (up to six fold) than was applied . . . Findings from this study indicated that there was an additional CO2 release (i.e. greater than the C added) on application of organic C substrates to some soil treatments. However, findings from this study indicate that the response of the microbial community to small additions of soluble C substrate is not consistent for all soil types and may vary due to greater availability of C, and supports the premise that microbial responses vary in a yet to be predicted manner between soil type and ecosystems. Differences in microbial response to the addition of soluble organic C are likely attributable to differences in soil attributes and environmental factors influencing both the diversity of microbes present and the frequency of food events. Theoretically, trigger molecules could also provide a possible control mechanism for microorganisms in arable farming systems. These mechanisms include stimulating either targeted pathogenic microorganisms that starve after depletion of a suitable substrate; or stimulating beneficial microorganisms to manipulate nutrient cycling, by targeting specific functional groups and altering mineralisation and immobilisation turnover rates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soils -- Nitrogen content -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Carbon content -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">Agricultural chemistry</field><field name="subject">Soil science</field><field name="subject">Trigger molecule</field><field name="subject">Organic substrates</field><field name="subject">Microbial function</field><field name="subject">Environmental modulators</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of self-filtration on saturated hydraulic conductivity in sodic sandy soils</field><field name="creator">Dikinya, Oagile</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Self-filtration is here defined as particle detachment and re-deposition causing re-arrangement of the particles and therefore pore space which affects water flow in soil by decreasing hydraulic conductivity. This is of particular important in soils which are susceptible to structural breakdown. The objective of this thesis was to examine the dynamics of the self-filtration process in sodic sandy soils as affected by ionic strength and soil solution composition. The temporal changes of hydraulic conductivity and the elution of fine particles from soil columns were used as the main criteria to assess selffiltration. Two porous media exhibiting significantly different structural cohesion were examined, one a loamy sand (Balkuling soil) from agricultural land use and the second a mining residue from mineral sands operations . . . The effects of the composition of mixed calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) ions in solution (sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)) on the exchange behaviour and saturated hydraulic conductivity were examined by carrying out batch binary exchange and saturated column transport experiments. A strong preference for Ca2+ ions in the exchange complex was observed for both soils. Generally K/Ko was found to decrease with increasing sodium adsorption ratio with the more structured Balkuling soil maintaining K/Ko for SARs 3 and 5 at an electrolyte concentration of 100 mmol/L. However measurements at the critical threshold and turbidity concentrations at a SAR of 15 revealed structural breakdown of the pore matrix system attributed to various extents of slaking, swelling, dispersion and decreases of pore radii as a result of selffiltration during leaching. These experiments illustrate the wide range of complex interactions involving clay mineralogy, solution composition and structural factors which can influence the extent of mobilization, transport and re-deposition of colloidal particles during the leaching process in soil profiles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particles</field><field name="subject">Dispersion</field><field name="subject">Soil absorption and adsorption</field><field name="subject">Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Filters and filtration</field><field name="subject">Sand</field><field name="subject">Soil permeability</field><field name="subject">Particle release</field><field name="subject">Saturated hydraulic conductivity</field><field name="subject">Pore clogging</field><field name="subject">Soil water retention</field><field name="subject">Self-filtration</field><field name="subject">Pore structure</field><field name="subject">Particle size distribution</field><field name="subject">Sodium adsorption ratio</field><field name="subject">Calcium ions</field><field name="subject">Sodium ions</field><field name="subject">Breakthrough curve</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of several azasugars, glycosylated azasugars and disaccharides of biological interest</field><field name="creator">Meloncelli, Peter J.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The development of several carbohydrate-based pharmaceuticals has stimulated an increased interest in the field of carbohydrate chemistry.

The better the quality of these institutional arrangements, the more confidence market participants have to conduct transactions. Although the links between these institutions and economic growth have been empirically tested many times (and shown to be extremely important), several gaps still exist in our understanding of this relationship. Two of the more important issues are (i) what the causal relationship may be between institutions and economic growth, and (ii) what the (undoubtedly complex) transmission mechanisms may be between them . . . Using a variety of alternative variables and samples, the evidence presented here strongly suggests that institutional quality is a major causal determinant of investment and human capital (particularly higher levels of education), as well as having an additional (though weaker) causal effect on growth itself. There is also an indication that there is reverse causality running from economic growth back to institutions.

This thesis examines mother-as-subject from three perspectives: mothering as a corporeal experience, mothering as a psychological experience, and the articulations and silences of mothering-as-subject. It engages with feminist, postmodern and fictocritical theories in its discussion of motherhood as a discourse through these perspectives. In particular, the thesis employs the theoretical works of postmodern feminists H&#233;l&#232;ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva in this discussion . . . A fictional narrative also runs through the critical discussion on motherhood. This narrative, Catherine&#8217;s Story, gives a personal and immediate voice to the mother-as-subject perspective. In keeping with the nature of fictocriticism, strict textual boundaries between criticism and fiction are blurred. The two modes of writing interact and in the process inform and critique each other.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motherhood in literature</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction -- 20th century -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Feminism in literature</field><field name="subject">Fictocriticism</field><field name="subject">Psychoanalytic</field><field name="subject">Postmodernism</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explorations of social capital and physical activity participation among adults on Christmas Island</field><field name="creator">Lee, Poh Chin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This research investigates social capital within the everyday space and actions of sociability on Christmas Island. The theory of social capital as proposed by Robert Putnam (1995) provides the framework for this investigation which was conducted in two phases. Quantitative and qualitative approaches and a mixed methods concurrent nested strategy were used in both phases of the investigation and the analyses. The analyses also incorporated multiple perspectives of both social capital and physical activity processes. In the first phase, I sought to: (a) uncover the determinants of social capital within the Christmas Island community; (b) develop a social capital typology; and (c) establish the relationship between the determinants of social capital and adults&#8217; physical activity involvement. In all, 212 participants took part in the study . . . Overall, several factors affected women&#8217;s social capital and physical activity. These included: (a) women&#8217;s societal roles and positions; (b) household and cultural norms relating to gender-based time and space negotiations; (c) ideologies surrounding ethic of care; and (d) role commitment. These factors also influenced women&#8217;s recruitment into becoming active in their community. Network embeddedness and autonomy, assimilation and acculturation as well as language and knowledge competency further distinguished the community and physical activity status of European and Asian women. Analysis related to the two physical activity programmes in part 3 showed how various forms of latent social capital within the community can be synergized to produce physical activity benefits and empower inactive and minority-group women. Findings in this study also support trust as an important element in the establishment of relatedness in a physical activity setting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">Infrastructure (Economics)</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) -- Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early behavioural markers in autism spectrum disorders : implications for theories of autism</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Sharyn</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There are few existing screening instruments designed to identify Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) at an early age, such as the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). Unfortunately, many are limited in their ability to identify children at risk in the first two years of life while displaying an acceptable level of reliability. Given this limitation, the present study aimed to identify any additional early markers of ASD from either the retrospective analysis of early autistic symptomatology (parental report and video analysis of footage made before the diagnosis) or performance-based measures linked to different theoretical accounts of ASD. Specifically, measures addressing theory of mind, executive dysfunction and weak central coherence were developed. In the first study, parents of three groups of children  those of typical development (n = 19, mean CA = 26 months), children with an ASD (n = 39, mean CA = 34 months) and children with developmental delay (n = 14, mean CA = 28 months)  were interviewed about their child's early development. In the first study, parents of three groups of children  those of typical development (n = 19, mean CA = 26 months), children with an ASD (n = 39, mean CA = 34 months) and children with developmental delay (n = 14, mean CA = 28 months)  were interviewed about their child's early development. Several behaviours discriminated children with ASD from children with typical development and children with delayed development. ... A discriminant function analysis using the two factor scores indicated that Factor 1 discriminated the ADI-R groups, while Factor 2 scores did not add to the ability of Factor 1 scores to discriminate the ADI-R groups. Furthermore, while the finding that joint attention behaviours differentiated children with ASD from children with typical development and children with delayed development, more research is needed to determine if this impairment is a precursor of a theory of mind deficit or if this impairment and later appearing impairments in theory of mind are the result of a more global impairment in social-emotional approach behaviours. Additional research is also needed to determine the relationship between the early appearing deficits in joint attention and the impairments in social relating behaviours that appear to develop later in the chronology of ASD development and how both of these relate to the theory of mind hypothesis of ASD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autism -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Autism in children -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Developmental disabilities</field><field name="subject">Autism</field><field name="subject">Screening</field><field name="subject">Developmental disorders</field><field name="subject">Cognitive development</field><field name="subject">Social development</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment on lactogenesis II in ewes and women</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Jennifer Jean</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There is a large body of evidence describing the benefits and risks, to the human fetus, of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment, but no published research on the effects on lactation. The withdrawal of progesterone, in the presence of high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids and prolactin, triggers the onset of copious milk secretion (lactogenesis II) at the end of pregnancy. The alteration of lactogenesis II by exogenous glucocorticoids could potentially have adverse impacts on postnatal nutrition in both term and preterm infants. I aimed to determine the effects of maternal antenatal glucocorticoid treatment on lactogenesis II in both ewes and women. I found profound adverse effects on lactation in ewes, and similar but more subtle effects on lactation in women . . . This thesis represents the first investigation of the effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment on lactogenesis II in both ewes and women. I found that, in ewes, antenatal glucocorticoid treatment stimulated premature lactogenesis II, and this was caused by disruptions to hormonal regulation during pregnancy. This event was followed by profound delays in lactogenesis II after term parturition. More subtle effects in women suggest that antenatal glucocorticoid treatment did not have a major, prolonged impact on postnatal lactogenesis II. Very preterm gestational age strongly predicted delays in lactogenesis II stressing the importance of assistance for these mothers when they are establishing lactation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactation disorders</field><field name="subject">Premature infants</field><field name="subject">Antenatal glucocorticoid treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraction of desmosines from urine : an indicator for inflammatory lung damage</field><field name="creator">Winfield, Kaye R</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Urinary desmosines have been proposed as a biomarker for inflammatory lung damage. Desmosine, a breakdown product of elastin, is an effective marker of the degradation of elastin and has been studied in many disease scenarios where there is acute and chronic lung inflammation. Lung matrix degradation has been proven in vitro and in vivo with many experiments showing that the excess proteases degrades lung matrix. The secretion of proteases by neutrophils is an innate response of the body to the invasion by micro organisms and when secreted in excess, the protective anti-protease mechanism is swamped. Chronic inflammation and persistent infection eventually leads to bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. Urinary desmosine has been shown to be elevated in respiratory conditions with acute and chronic inflammation . . . Urinary desmosine levels in a large cohort of healthy children have been established using this method and predictive Z-score formulae have been developed to use in children with lung disease. Exploration of these scores in children with CF have shown that the levels of urinary desmosine appear to be sensitive to the clinical setting, where high urinary desmosine levels were present during exacerbation and significantly reduced when treated for infection with antibiotic therapy and physiotherapy. The study of young children under the age of seven was undertaken to determine if the urinary desmosine levels could indicate when lung damage was occurring and to determine what mechanisms might be involved. Since there appeared to be no apparent relationship between elevated desmosines and proteases in the lung in young children with CF, further studies are required to define the mechanisms behind increased elastin metabolism in those children.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elastin</field><field name="subject">Cystic fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Lungs -- Diseases -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Urine -- Examination</field><field name="subject">Urinary desmosines</field><field name="subject">Cystro fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory lung disease</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drivers of student satisfaction and student loyalty in an Australian university setting</field><field name="creator">Brown, Robert Maxwell</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The Australian higher education sector has changed markedly in the last two decades. The size of the sector has swelled in size as new universities have been created from former Colleges of Advanced Education and Institutes of Technology, and succeeding governments have introduced policies that have embedded increasingly corporate and commercial practices into university administration. This has caused the creation of what are becoming known as &#8216;enterprise universities&#8217;. This thesis examines hypotheses arising from two fundamental questions. (i) Given the increasingly market-oriented higher education environment in Australia, will a model developed from the study of services marketing (which has developed since the 1970s as a distinct sub-branch of the Marketing discipline) show itself to be applicable to universities operating in the Australian sector? (ii) If so, are there demonstrable differences in the way in which &#8216;student customers&#8217; respond in terms of the antecedents of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty within different types of university? . . . The study found that the model tested was highly appropriate for indicating the major antecedents of satisfaction and loyalty in this setting. It showed that the institutional image was a relatively stronger antecedent of perceived value and customer satisfaction than were elements of service quality, and that the model was effective in accounting for a large proportion of the variance found in students&#8217; loyalty to their institution. It also found that there was relatively little difference between students attending different types of university in these matters. It argues that there is an important imperative for Australian universities to take a strategic image management approach to their marketing initiatives, and also issues related to the nature of higher education as a positional and public good.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Australia -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Australia -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Marketing research</field><field name="subject">Education, Higher -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Customer satisfaction index</field><field name="subject">Services marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cortical response to fatiguing exercise : studies of intracortical inhibition, interventional brain stimulation and cerebral haemodynamics</field><field name="creator">Benwell, Nicola Mae</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A reduction in the force-generating capacity of a muscle is the primary indicator of fatigue and the majority of this force loss is the result of peripheral fatigue. However, there is also evidence that the central nervous system (CNS) does not drive muscles maximally during fatiguing exercise, which has led to the concept of central fatigue. The strongest evidence for this comes from interpolated twitch studies showing that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during a maximal voluntary contraction can produce an increment in force which becomes greater as fatigue develops. In addition, the silent period (SP) duration increases during a fatiguing exercise, suggesting that there is a buildup of intracortical inhibition that might limit central motor drive. In contrast, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude increases during fatigue suggesting an increase in corticomotor excitability during exercise . . . The primary finding was a progressive increase in the fMRI signal during exercise, with a reduction following exercise, and signal changes were observed in all regions. These studies provide evidence that central adaptive processes occur during muscle fatigue and highlight the potential to facilitate these processes with interventional paradigms. The findings indicate the extent of cortical changes during fatigue and suggest that there may also be neurohaemodynamic and/or metabolic components to central adaptive processes. Understanding the central response to muscle fatigue should incorporate mechanisms both of central adaptation and central fatigue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muscles -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Hemodynamics</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Brain stimulation</field><field name="subject">Fatiguing exercise</field><field name="subject">Functional imaging</field><field name="subject">Motor cortex</field><field name="subject">Transcranial magnetic stimulation</field><field name="subject">Central adaptations</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental study of the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatment to reduce the side effects of radiation treatment for malignant disease</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Raymond Allan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Therapeutic Radiation has been used for the treatment of cancer and other diseases for nearly a century. Over the past 20 years, Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the more severe complications associated with the side effects of Therapeutic Radiation Treatment (TRT). The use of HBOT is based on the premise that increased oxygen tissue tension aids wound healing by increasing the hypoxic gradient and stimulating angiogenesis and fibroblast differentiation. As it takes up to 6 months for a hypoxic state to develop in treated tissue, following radiation treatment, current recommendations for HBOT state that it is not effective until after this time. During this 6 month period, immediately following TRT, many specialized tissues in or adjacent to the field of irradiation, such as salivary glands and bone, are damaged due to a progressive thickening of arteries and fibrosis, and these tissues are never replaced. Currently, HBOT is used to treat the complications of TRT, but it would be far better if they could be prevented . . . In summary, this experimental model has fulfilled its prime objective of demonstrating that HBOT is effective in reducing the long-term side effects of therapeutic radiation treatment in normal tissue, when given one week after the completion of the radiation treatment and statistically disproves the Null Hypothesis that there is no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or morbidity of TRT when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after completion of TRT.

Thus, we wish to aid understanding of the economic mechanisms by which the world wool market operates. In doing so, we analyse two issues  trade and productivity  and their effect on, inter alia, grower incomes. To achieve the objective, we develop a novel analytical framework, or model. The model combines two long and rich modelling traditions: the partial-equilibrium commodity-specific approach and the computable-general-equilibrium approach. The result is a model that represents the world wool market in detail, tracking the production of greasy wool through five off-farm production stages ending in the production of wool garments. Capturing the multistage nature of the wool production system is a key pillar in this part of the model . . . The estimated welfare gain for China is 0.1% of real income; this is a significant welfare gain. For three losing regions  Italy, Germany and Japan  the results are robust and we can be highly confident that these regions are the largest losers from the complete removal of 2005 wool tariffs. In both wool tariff liberalisation scenarios, regions whose exports are skewed towards wool textiles and garments gain the most as it is these wool products that have the highest initial tariff rates. The overall finding of this work is that a sophisticated analytical framework is necessary for analysing productivity and trade issues in the world wool market. Only a model of this kind can appropriately handle the degree of complexity of interactions between members (domestic and foreign) of the multistage wool production system. Further, including the nonwool economy in the analytical framework allows us to capture the indirect effects of changes in the world wool market and also the effects on the nonwool economy itself.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wool -- Marketing -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Wool industry -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Wool industry -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Equilibrium (Economics)</field><field name="subject">Wool industry -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">World wool market</field><field name="subject">Technical change</field><field name="subject">Trade</field><field name="subject">Computable general equilibrium</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous commodities</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconceptualising ethnic Chinese identity in post-Suharto Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Hoon, Chang-Yau</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  The May 1998 anti-Chinese riots brought to the fore the highly problematic position of the ethnic Chinese in the Indonesian nation.

The introduced house mouse, Mus domesticus, exists on Boullanger and Whitlock islands, and the King&#8217;s skink, Egernia kingii, inhabits Boullanger and Escape islands. The grey-bellied dunnart, Sminthopsis griseoventer, exists on Boullanger Island. Over the last 150 years, the wedge-tailed shearwater, Puffinus pacificus, has colonised the islands to varying degrees. The interaction between dibblers and other island species is not clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the main factors regulating the dynamics of mammals, and in particular dibblers, on the Jurien islands. This was achieved by examining the effect of seabirds, the competitive interactions between species living on the islands, and seasonal changes in the environment. Animals were trapped for a period of 30 months, and their population structure, body condition, longevity, habitat preferences, diet and ecophysiology were examined. The results presented support the theory that by increasing soil nutrient concentrations, burrowing seabirds increase the primary productivity of islands, which has flow on effects to other trophic levels. Densities of seabirds and soil nutrient concentrations were highest on Whitlock Island, intermediate on Escape Island, and lowest on Boullanger Island . . .Thirty-five percent of dibblers on Escape Island were missing their tail or a limb, probably as a result of aggression from King&#8217;s skinks. Competition from high numbers of house mice on Boullanger Island, and from high numbers of King&#8217;s skinks on Escape Island, may increase the occurrence of male die-off on these islands. The better body condition and greater longevity of dibblers on Whitlock Island, despite high numbers of house mice, suggests that abundant resources are available to sustain both species. This study demonstrates that high densities of seabirds positively affect the population dynamics of mammals on the Jurien islands. Burrowing seabirds appear to influence the dynamics of dibblers more so than competition from house mice or King&#8217;s skinks. The findings from this study will assist the Dibbler Recovery Team with future management decisions regarding the viability of dibblers on the Jurien islands, and with decisions regarding the necessity to control house mouse numbers in the presence of native species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sea birds -- Western Australia -- Jurien Bay</field><field name="subject">Marsupials -- Western Australia -- Jurien Bay</field><field name="subject">Ecology -- Western Australia -- Jurien Bay Region</field><field name="subject">Dibblers</field><field name="subject">Dibbler</field><field name="subject">Parantechinus apicalis</field><field name="subject">House mouse</field><field name="subject">Mus domesticus</field><field name="subject">Kings skink</field><field name="subject">Egerina Kingii</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immune recognition and editing of tumours expressing multiple antigenic epitopes in two murine models</field><field name="creator">Bundell, Christine Stephanie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The design of effective immunotherapies, using tumour antigens to stimulate a functional effector cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response in a tumour bearing host, requires an understanding of the 'real time' in vivo relationship between the host immune system and antigens expressed by the developing tumour. However, effector function of endogenous anti-tumour CTLs generated during tumour progression has largely been assessed by indirect ex vivo assays and often focused on a single antigen. Therefore, studies in this thesis evaluated the endogenous in vivo CTL response to multiple tumour antigenic epitopes in murine tumour models using Lewis lung carcinoma cells transfected with ovalbumin (an antigen that contains several intra-molecular MHC class I epitopes with a defined hierarchy) or a polyepitope (that contains a string of immunodominant MHC class I epitopes). Potent effector CTLs were generated to multiple dominant tumour antigenic epioptes early in tumour progression. However, in general, these CTL effectors only transiently retarded tumour growth, and at the later time points of tumour growth they were no longer generated in tumour draining lymph nodes. This coincided with diminished tumour antigen presentation in the same nodes which was found to be due to antigen loss. In both models antigen loss was the result of two processes; immuno-editing of the tumour by the host immune response and genetic instability resulting in antigen loss variants that could evade immune surveillance. A third model was generated that maintained low level tumour antigen expression throughout tumour progression. ... The impact of pre-existing endogenous dominant-epitope specific CTLs on tumour expressing the same epitope was also assessed, and resulted in a reduced tumour incidence and a CTL response restricted to a single antigen of the same MHC allele. Finally, the effects of two different immunotherapy regimens were examined. Intratumoural IL-2 treatment enhanced pre-existing CTL responses to the dominant epitopes leading to tumour regression. In addition, use of a multiple peptide vaccination regimen that avoided T cells competing for peptide-MHC complexes on APC was far more likely to be effective than one that did not. These results demonstrate that immunotherapies targeting tumours that express several dominant neo antigenic epitopes can be effective. The caveat for this approach is that it will only be effective in tumours that have generated an endogenous CTL response and must be used before antigen loss variants emerge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumors -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">Tumor antigens</field><field name="subject">Tumour immunology</field><field name="subject">Antigen loss</field><field name="subject">In vivo CTC function</field><field name="subject">Multiple tumour antigenic epitones</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mood selection in Old Italian : the subjunctive and indicative in complement clauses in non-literary Tuscan of the Quattrocento</field><field name="creator">McAuliffe, Narelle</field><field name="description">This thesis explores mood selection in Old Italian, describing the use of the subjunctive and indicative in complement clauses in non-literary Tuscan of the Quattrocento (1375-1499). Using Wandruszka&#8217;s (1991) model of the subjunctive, and a Tuscan corpus of merchant letters and ricordi, sermons and other religious writing, based on Tavoni&#8217;s (1992) hierarchy of non-literary Quattrocento writings, I quantitatively assess the factors that influence mood selection in complement clauses. I restrict my analysis to complement clauses so as to compare the findings with those of Stefinlongo&#8217;s (1977) and Vegnaduzzo&#8217;s (2000) similar corpus-based studies of mood selection in thirteenth-century Italian, where possible, in order to suggest any trends in the use of the subjunctive. While I find that the semantics of the governing lexical element still has the predominant influence on the mood of the complement clause in fifteenth-century Italian, I also find that other factors, such as clause type, person and number, and tense and aspect, have a significant role in the modal outcome of complement clauses. However, the influence of these other factors is neither categorical nor equal, and it may be collective in the case of co-present factors. By conducting a quantitative comparison of mood selection in a variety of text types, my study also investigates Stefinlongo&#8217;s hypothesis that subjunctive use is not influenced solely by semantic or syntactic factors but also by features at the level of text type. However, I find the modal influence of text type to be largely indirect, influencing the relative incidence of different semantic contexts which in turn influences the incidence of subjunctive and indicative in a text. The findings of this study serve to inform our understanding of the evolution of the subjunctive in Italian.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian language -- 1300-1500 -- Subjunctive</field><field name="subject">Italian language -- 1300-1500 -- Indicative</field><field name="subject">Italian language -- 1300-1500 -- Complement</field><field name="subject">Italian language -- 1300-1500 -- Grammar</field><field name="subject">Tuscan</field><field name="subject">Complement clauses</field><field name="subject">Quattrocento</field><field name="subject">Non-literary</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal stability of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited silicon nitride thin films</field><field name="creator">Jehanathan, Neerushana</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study investigates the thermal stability of Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride thin films. Effects of heat-treatment in air on the chemical composition, atomic bonding structure, crystallinity, mechanical properties, morphological and physical integrity are investigated. The chemical composition, bonding structures and crystallinity are studied by means of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties, such as hardness and Young&#8217;s modulus, are determined by means of nanoindentation. The morphological and physical integrity are analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) . . . The Young&#8217;s modulus (E) and hardness (H) of the film deposited at 448 K were measured to have E=121&#177;1.8 GPa and H=11.7&#177;0.25 GPa. The film deposited at 573 K has E=150&#177;3.6 GPa and H=14.7&#177;0.6 GPa. For the film deposited at 573 K, the Young&#8217;s modulus is not affected by heating up to 1148 K. Heating at 1373 K caused significant increase in Young&#8217;s modulus to 180&#8764;199 GPa. This is attributed to the crystallization of the film. For the film deposited at 448 K, the Young&#8217;s modulus showed a moderate increase, by &#8764;10%, after heating to above 673 K. This is consistent with the much lower level of crystallization in this film as compared to the film deposited at 573 K. In summary, low temperature deposited PECVD SiNx films are chemically and structurally unstable when heated in air to above 673 K. The main changes include oxidation to SiO2, crystallization of Si3N4 and physical cracking. The film deposited at 573 K is more stable and damage and oxidation resistant than the film deposited at 448 K.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin films -- Stability</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="subject">Oxidizing agents</field><field name="subject">Thin film devices</field><field name="subject">Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="subject">Heat treatment</field><field name="subject">Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Plasma enhanced PECVD vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Oxidation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A 50 K dual-mode sapphire oscillator and whispering spherical mode oscillators</field><field name="creator">Anstie, James D.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis is split into two parts.

A cylindrical sapphire loaded copper cavity resonator was designed, modelled and built with a turning point in the difference frequency between an E-mode and H-mode pair at approximately 52.5 K . . . The frequencies and Q-factors of whispering spherical modes in the 3-12 GHz range in the fused silica resonator are measured at 6, 77 and 300 K and the Q-factor is used to determine the loss tangent at these temperatures. The frequency and Q-factor temperature dependence of the TM2,1,2 whispering gallery mode at 5.18 GHZ is used to characterise the loss tangent and relative permittivity of the fused silica from 4-300 K. Below 22 K the frequency-temperature dependence of the resonator was found to be consistent with the combined effects of the thermal properties of the dielectric and the influence of an unknown paramagnetic impurity, with a spin resonance frequency at about 138 &#177; 31 GHz. Below 8 K the loss tangent exhibited a 9th order power law temperature dependence, which may be explained by Raman scattering of Phonons from the paramagnetic impurity ions. A spherical Bragg reflector resonator made from multiple concentric dielectric layers loaded in a spherical cavity that enables confinement of field in the centre of the resonator is described. A set of simultaneous equations is derived that allow the calculation of the required dimensions and resonance frequency for such a resonator and the solution is confirmed using finite element analysis. A spherical Bragg reflector resonator is constructed using Teflon and free-space as the dielectric materials. A Q-factor of 22,000 at 13.87 GHz was measured and found to compare well with the design values.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atomic clocks</field><field name="subject">Oscillators, Electric</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear oscillators</field><field name="subject">Frequencies of oscillating systems</field><field name="subject">Dielectric resonator oscillators</field><field name="subject">Sapphire oscillators</field><field name="subject">Temperature control</field><field name="subject">Whispering gallery modes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of wildfire propagation using the interacting spatial automata formalism</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Adam</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In this thesis, I address the modelling and computer simulation of spatial, eventdriven systems from a computer science perspective. Spatially explicit models of wildland fire (wildfire) behaviour are addressed as the specific application domain. Wildfire behaviour is expressed as a formal model and the associated simulations are compared to existing models and implementations. It is shown that the in- teracting spatial automata formalism provides a general framework for modelling spatial event-driven systems and is appropriate to wildfire systems. The challenge adressed is that of physically realistic modelling of wildfire behaviour in heterogeneous environments . . . Many current models do not incorporate the influence of a neighbourhood (the geometry of the fire front local to an unburnt volume of fuel, for example), but rather determine the propagation of fire using only point information. Whilst neighbourhood-based influence of behaviour is common to cellular automata theory, its use is very rare in existing models of wildfire models. In this thesis, I present the modelling technique and demonstrate its applicability to wildfire systems via a series of simulation experiments, where I reproduce known spatial wildfire dynamics. I conclude that the interacting spatial automata formalism is appropriate as a basis for constructing new computer simulations of wildfire spread behaviour. Simulation results are compared to existing implementations, highlighting the limitations of current models and demonstrating that the new models are capable of greater physical realism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Wildfire forecasting -- Computer programs</field><field name="subject">Wildfires -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Wildfire modelling</field><field name="subject">Modelling formalisms</field><field name="subject">Complex systems</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expression and function of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 in human serous ovarian carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Drake, Jeremy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Ovarian cancer is currently the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies in women from developed countries. Serous ovarian cancer is the most prevalent type of all ovarian cancers, with the majority diagnosed in an advanced stage where treatment efficacy is reduced and patient survival is poor. Because of this fact, the development of improved detection and treatment strategies are necessary, with much research focussing on the complex molecular pathways involved in ovarian tumour growth as one potential avenue for intervention. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is one such area of investigation because currently successful cancer treatments induce apoptosis in tumour cells. Molecular analysis of apoptosis in both normal tissue and tumours has established a positive relationship between increased expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) and apoptosis, however to date, very little research has focussed on the role of this gene in the ovary . . . An examination of SFRP4 and &#946;-catenin expression in 163 primary serous ovarian carcinomas revealed high SFRP4 expression was associated with low &#946;-catenin expression and conversely, low SFRP4 was associated with high &#946;-catenin expression in the majority of the ovarian tumours analysed, reinforcing the inverse relationship observed in the ovarian cell lines. A positive trend was observed between cancer stage and the expression level of these proteins, with increased SFRP4 expression and reduced &#946;-catenin expression as cancer stage increased. Additionally, patient survival revealed a trend towards increased survival among ovarian cancer patients who had tumours expressing low levels of SFRP4. Taken together, the novel findings of this study indicate that the increased expression of SFRP4 observed in a large proportion of serous ovarian cancers is a cellular response to down-regulate the level of &#946;-catenin, and thus an attempt to maintain cellular homeostasis by counteracting the excessive proliferating signals present in these tumour cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Cancer -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Cancer -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">SFRP4</field><field name="subject">Beta-catenin</field><field name="subject">WNT</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Ovary</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Reagan's backyard : an examination of the condition of liberalism in California in the early 1980s</field><field name="creator">Muller, Craig</field><field name="description">In 1980, Ronald Reagan became the fortieth president of the United States following an election that was said to have presaged a political turn to the right in that country. This thesis identifies three broad historical themes that characterised the period in the immediate aftermath of the 1980 election. Firstly, there was the notion that the voting public was becoming more conservative in its choices in federal politics. This is tested by looking at voter behaviour in the 1982 midterm elections. Secondly, the idea that the liberal-conservative dialectic was becoming less important in United States politics is examined using as a framework the actions and statements of prominent liberals. Thirdly, the thesis examines the accuracy of prognoses that were being made about liberalism as a viable political entity in the wake of the 1980 elections. These themes are examined via a series of parallel, occasionally overlapping narratives, following the main strands of liberal activity and thought in one state  California  in the early 1980s. Many of the sources used were derived from commentary that was being made as events unfolded. The debate about the meaning of the 1980 election therefore changes and this change is part of the story told here. Answering some questions also involved using source material that was more reflective. Hence, parts of the thesis are historiographical. Despite its political content, this thesis is a work of history. It examines the drama of men and women acting within their time, bound by the world around them, but also trying to change that world.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reagan, Ronald, -- 1911-</field><field name="subject">Liberalism -- California -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">California -- Politics and government -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Californian political history</field><field name="subject">Liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of English as a global language in multinational settings and the implications for business education</field><field name="creator">Briguglio, Carmela</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This study explored the use of English as a global language in multinational settings, particularly in regard to business contexts. The study was undertaken from an applied linguistics perspective with an education focus. An ethnographic approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data-gathering techniques, was employed. An analysis of the language practices in two multinational companies, one in Malaysia and the other in Hong Kong, served to explore the global role of English. Such observation helped to identify the English and intercultural communication skills that business graduates will require to operate successfully in multinational contexts. Among the skills that were found to be important were the use of English for email communication; greater tolerance for and accommodation of the different accents and varieties of English; the ability to write informal reports in English; development of both oral and written communication skills in English to high levels; and the ability to work collaboratively with people from different national, cultural and linguistic backgrounds . . . More carefully considered teaching and learning approaches, which fully utilise the rich cultural diversity already existing in Australian universities, can assist the development of business graduates who will be more culturally sensitive and able to operate in international/ intercultural contexts. There is scope for further research on similar themes with other multinational companies in the same or different locations; there is also much scope for further work in the area of internationalisation of curriculum, which aims particularly to develop graduates&#8217; intercultural communication skills to enable them to operate confidently in global and multinational settings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language -- Business English -- Study and teaching -- Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Business communication</field><field name="subject">Intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">English language -- China -- Hong Kong</field><field name="subject">English language -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises -- Employees -- Training of -- China -- Hong Kong -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises -- Employees -- Training of -- Malaysia -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">English as a global language</field><field name="subject">Multinational companies</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleation of solitons in the presence of defects</field><field name="creator">Loxley, Peter</field><field name="description">[abstract] In the process of nucleation, the decay of a metastable state is initiated by the formation of a spatially localised region called a nucleus of critical size. In many realistic situations nucleation is initiated at an impurity or defect; such as a dust particle, an irregularity in a sample, or a crack in the wall of a container. The aim of this thesis is to identify and understand the fundamental changes different types of defect make to nucleation by studying a one-dimensional continuum model used to describe solitons. A well established theory due to Langer is extended to calculate the rate of decay of a metastable state due to the nucleation of solitons at defects. Results are used to find the rate of thermally activated magnetisation reversal for a ferromagnetic nanowire with defects in the uniaxial anisotropy. Defects which are narrower than the soliton width (point-like defects) and wider than the soliton width (step defects) are both modelled. An attractive defect breaks the translational symmetry of a soliton and leads to pinning. The pinning of solitons is found to reduce the activation energy required for nucleation, reduce the critical field above which a metastable state becomes unstable, alter the mechanism by which a metastable state decays, and modify the prefactor for the rate of decay. Changes to the prefactor are interpreted in terms of entropy and the dynamics of metastable decay when a defect is present.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solitons -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Nucleation</field><field name="subject">Metastable state</field><field name="subject">Soliton pinning</field><field name="subject">Thermal activation</field><field name="subject">Magnetization reversal</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intra-tumoural regulatory T cells : a potential new target for anti-cancer immunotherapy</field><field name="creator">Ireland, Demelza Jane</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Previous studies in the field of tumour immunology had identified regulatory T (Treg) cells as important suppressors of the anti-tumour immune response as the presence of Treg cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients was correlated with worse disease outcomes. Other studies had identified Treg cells to be active at sites of immune regulation such as the gut of colitis patients. It was therefore hypothesised that Treg cells would be present and active within tumours to suppress the cellular antitumour immune response. ... This treatment targeting multiple pathways of Treg cell mediated immuno-suppression and resulted in tumour regression in 50% of treated animals. Finally, the anti-tumour immune response is complex and a potentially synergistic multi-modality treatment designed to inactivate intra-tumoural Treg cells but to also induce apoptosis in tumour cells themselves was investigated. Alpha-tocopheryl succinate (&#945;-TOS), an analogue of vitamin E, had previously been shown to induce apoptosis in human MM xenografts implanted into immuno-deficient (nude) mice. Administration of &#945;-TOS was therefore examined as a potentially synergistic treatment to be coupled with Treg cell inactivation. At the previously published doses used to treat immuno-deficient mice, &#945;-TOS was found to be toxic to the immuno-competent mice used in this study. A marked depleting effect on total T cells was seen in the treated animals. The results of this thesis demonstrated the high potential for an adjunct immunotherapy of MM. They did however also highlight the importance of future studies into anticancer therapies to be conducted using clinically relevant tumour models and clinically relevant treatment regimes.

This research sought to describe the relationships between psychosocial stress, psychosocial resources, asthma severity, and health-related outcomes from the standpoints of biopsychosocial and developmental theory. The research consisted of three studies based on a prospective study involving 2573 children from a community-based birth cohort. The cohort has been under active follow-up from birth and this thesis draws on data obtained at the 1, 2, 6, 10 and 13 year follow-ups . . . The final study undertook to describe the mediating influence of specific supportive behaviours provided by family members and peers to adolescents with asthma. Ninety-nine adolescents participating in the 13 year follow-up of the community cohort study completed a semi-structured interview adapted from the Diabetes Social Support Interview (La Greca et al., 1995) to assess supportive behaviours and the KINDL (Ravens-Sieberer &amp; Bullinger, 1998) to assess QOL. It was predicted that illness-specific support would mediate the relationship between family dysfunction and quality of life. Qualitative analyses identified parents as important sources of tangible support, peers as important sources of companionship and emotional support, and siblings bridging the two, by providing tangible, companionship and emotional support to the adolescent. Mediator analyses found that specific parent behaviours perceived as unsupportive by the adolescent mediated the relationship between family dysfunction and self-oriented quality of life. Clinical implications support the integration of medical and psychological expertise in the treatment of asthma.

Rock phosphate has this function and was included for comparison purposes. All the byproducts had pH values above 9 and a liming capacity above 90% of pure lime, as a result, these materials will be effective as liming agents. Total P concentrations for CLA, CLAT, slag, and WA were 3.6%, 4.75%, 0.26%, and 0.44% respectively indicating that they could be used as P fertilizers when applied at the high rates required for liming soils. ... The RE values for all the materials relative to monocalcium phosphate (100%) for the first harvest are as follows, 50% for dicalcium phosphate, 31% for rock phosphate, 7% for partly burnt chicken litter ash, 7% for totally burnt chicken litter ash and 1% for wood ash and slag. The RE values for the second harvest were 100% for monocalcium phosphate, 80% for dicalcium phosphate, 40% for rock phosphate, 10% for partly burnt chicken litter ash, 8% for totally burnt chicken litter ash and 2% for wood ash and slag. Data for subsequent harvests are not reported due to the death of many plants. Clearly chicken litter ash has appreciable value as a phosphate fertilizer whereas wood ash and slag are ineffective. Explanations for these differences in effectiveness are discussed in the text.  An evaluation of the liming effect of the byproducts indicates that they may be used as a soil amendment on acid soils and are nearly as effective as standard lime (CaCO3).

However despite its increasing use, controversy still remains over fixed or mobile bearing tibial components, as there is a lack to prospective randomised studies reported in the literature. In addition, the theoretical advantages of the mobile bearing for knee kinematics, kinetics and clinical outcome have not been evaluated in vivo. The aim of this research study was to explore the clinical and biomechanical outcomes of the fixed and mobile bearing UKA.  . . . When the results for the both studies were combined, utilising the Preservation and MG fixed bearing prostheses, there was a significant relationship between knee adduction moment, and a poor prognosis predicted from RSA. Those patients with translation or rotation of the tibial component in any direction above 1mm and 1.5 degrees respectively were considered to have a poor prognosis for long term fixation. Of the 28 patients, the 8 patients considered to have a poor prognosis, had increased knee adduction moments post-surgery (mean difference = 1.66Nm.kg-1, p = 0.007). There was no difference between the groups for knee flexion moment (mean difference 0.16Nm.kg-1, p = 0.844). Pre-surgery gait was unable to predict the post-surgery outcome, due to the significant changes in gait from pre- to post-surgery. Care must taken when implanting the Preservation mobile bearing prosthesis, as long term outcome is questionable. The mobile bearing prosthesis also produced the worst clinical outcome, however the theoretical advantages of the mobile bearing does not affect gait. Gait analysis is a useful tool to identify patient who are overloading their prosthesis, leading to potential early failure. Identification of these gait patterns can allow for early intervention to reduce joint load, and possible extend the longevity of the prosthesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knee -- Surgery -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Gait in humans</field><field name="subject">Orthopedic implants</field><field name="subject">Radiostereometric analysis</field><field name="subject">Unicondylar knee arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">Mobile bearing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optic nerve regeneration in adult rat</field><field name="creator">Hu, Ying</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There is limited intrinsic potential for repair in the adult human central nervous system (CNS). Dysfunction resulting from CNS injury is persistent and requires prolonged medical treatment and rehabilitation. The retina and optic nerve are CNSderived, and adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons are often used as a model in which to study the mechanisms associated with injury, neuroprotection and regeneration. In this study I investigated the effects of a variety of strategies on promoting RGC survival and axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury, including the use of reconstructed chimeric peripheral nerve (PN) grafts, gene therapy, and intraocular application of pharmacological agents and other factors . . . C3 transferase is an enzyme derived from Clostridium botulinum that inactivates Rho GTPase. Because SC myelin contains MAG and PN also contains CSPGs, I tested the effects of intraocular injection of a modified form of C3 (C3-11), provided by Dr Lisa McKerracher (CONFIDENTIAL data, under IP agreement with Bioaxone Therapeutic, Montreal) on RGC axonal regeneration into PN autografts. My results showed that there was significantly more RGC survival and axonal regeneration in PN autografts after repeated intraocular injection of C3. I also tested whether intraocular injections of CPT-cAMP and/or CNTF can act in concert with the C3 to further increase RGC survival and/or regeneration. Results showed that the effect of C3 and CPT-cAMP plus CNTF were synergistic and partially additive. The use of combination therapies therefore offers the best hope for robust and substantial regeneration. The overall results from my PhD project will help determine how best to reconstruct nerve pathways and use pharmacological interventions in the clinical treatment of CNS injury, hopefully leading to improved functional outcomes after neurotrauma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Central nervous system -- Wounds and injuries -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Nervous system -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Optic nerve -- Regeneration -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells</field><field name="subject">Optic nerve -- Wounds and injuries -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Rats -- Nervous system</field><field name="subject">Ciliary neurotrophic factor</field><field name="subject">Neural regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of interferon &#945; and &#947; in the hepatic progenitor (oval) cell response</field><field name="creator">Lim, Rebecca</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Hepatic progenitor cells (HPC) are becoming increasingly recognized as facultative stem cells capable of regenerating the liver during chronic liver injury and also as targets of malignant transformation. Similar markers are expressed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HPC, and a precursor-product relationship is well established. This thesis focuses on the ways in which the HPC population can be controlled under circumstances of chronic liver injury, and in this manner, reduce the risk of progression to HCC reduced. The major aim of Chapters 3 to 5 was to elucidate the effect of interferon &#945; (IFN&#945;) therapy on HPC. Chronic hepatitis C affects approximately 250 million individuals world wide. Approximately 80% of infections progress to chronicity, which places the individuals at greater risk of developing HCC. The gold standard of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is a combination of pegylated IFN&#945; and ribavirin. ...The results were surprising. While IFN&#947; exerted a pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effect on HPC in vitro, administration of IFN&#947; to CDE-fed mice for 14 days increased fibrosis, enhanced inflammatory infiltration and exacerbated the HPC response, with concurrent hepatocyte cell death. In addition, increased morbidity and mortality were observed in the IFN&#947;-treated mice compared to control. IFN&#947; treatment was found to prime the liver for the HPC response by recruiting inflammatory cells and altering the hepatic cytokine profile, both of which may facilitate an increased HPC response. Numbers of activated HSC were also increased in the IFN&#947;-treated, CDE-fed mice, correlating with the increased fibrosis seen in these animals. This data contradicts the current experimental use of IFN&#947; for treatment of fibrosis. Based on our results, we suggest that IFN&#947; promotes HPC proliferation in the CDE model, by encouraging inflammatory infiltration and hepatocyte damage and this initiates pro-fibrotic events. Concurrent proliferation of HPC and activated HSC further supports the view that there is a close relationship between the two cell types, and thus, a link between the HPC response and fibrosis. In conclusion, findings documented in this thesis suggest that administration of IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; can contribute to shaping the HPC response. IFN&#945; therapy may reduce HCC risk in chronic hepatitis C patients by bringing the HPC population under control. In contrast, IFN&#947; treatment can exacerbate the HPC response, liver fibrosis and parenchymal damage, illustrating the need to approach this method of fibrosis treatment with caution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver -- Cancer -- Cytopathology</field><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="subject">Liver cells -- Regeneration</field><field name="subject">Interferon -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Hepatic progenitor cells</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational optimal control modeling and smoothing for biomechanical systems</field><field name="creator">Said, Munzir</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The study of biomechanical system dynamics consists of research to obtain an accurate model of biomechanical systems and to find appropriate torques or forces that reproduce motions of a biomechanical subject. In the first part of this study, specific computational models are developed to maintain relative angle constraints for 2-dimensional segmented bodies. This is motivated by the fact that there is a possibility of models of segmented bodies, moving under gravitational acceleration and joint torques, for its segments to move past the natural relative angle limits. Three models to maintain angle constraints between segments are proposed and compared. These models are: all-time angle constraints, a restoring torque in the state equations and an exponential penalty model. The models are applied to a 2-D three segment body to test the behaviour of each model when optimizing torques to minimize an objective. The optimization is run to find torques so that the end effector of the body follows the trajectory of a half circle. The result shows the behavior of each model in maintaining the angle constraints. The all-time constraints case exhibits a behaviour of not allowing torques (at a solution) which make segments move past the constraints, while the other two show a flexibility in handling the angle constraints more similar to a real biomechanical system. With three computational methods to represent the angle contraint, a workable set of initial torques for the motion of a segmented body can be obtained without causing integration failure in the ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver and without the need to use the &#8220;blind man method&#8221; that restarts the optimal control many times. ...  With one layer of penalty weight balancing between trajectory compliance penalty and other optimal control objectives (minimizing torque/smoothing torque) already difficult to obtain (as explained by the L-curve phenomena), adding the second layer penalty weight for the closeness of fit for each of the body segments will further complicate the weight balancing and too much trial and error computation may be needed to get a reasonably good set of weighting values. Second order regularization is also added to the optimal control objective and the optimization has managed to obtain smoother torques for all body joints. To make the current approach more competitive with the inverse dynamic, an algorithm to speed up the computation of the optimal control is required as a potential future work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomechanics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Kinematics -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Biomechanical system modelling</field><field name="subject">Body segement parameters</field><field name="subject">BSP estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different stories about the same place :  interpreting narrative, practice and tradition in the East Kimberley of northern Australia and the Aru Island of Eastern Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Corrigan, Brendan</field><field name="description">This thesis interrogates the relationship of archaeological models and indigenous understandings of origins in the East Kimberley region of Northern Australia and the Aru Islands of Eastern Indonesia. Archaeological models of prehistoric migration construct these places as part of the same landmass in the recent human period and at times of lower sea levels. Yet, the indigenous groups who currently inhabit these places assert and rely upon their localised understandings of autochthony and mythological creationism. The existence of these competing models has led me to examine the degree to which the practice of archaeology in these locations constructs human prehistory in a way that necessarily disempowers the indigenous cosmology there. Below I examine the construction and content of these different stories about the same place to show how it is that they are essentially competing, conflicting and contradictory claims to truth. I show how each of these asserted cosmological positions emerge from the various cultural systems that sponsor and perpetuate them and I pay special attention to the role of institutionally authorised experts within each of the cosmological positions described. I also seek to demonstrate the ways in which the distribution of expert knowledge plays a core role in a naturalised social order and the ongoing construction of cultural identity in their respective communities. I then interrogate the relationships that these differing forms of knowledge have with each other - paying close attention to the specifics of context in which they are evoked. I conclude that the examination of how these competing claims to truth are distributed in space reveals their influence in the ongoing construction of identity in their respective communities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Western Australia -- East Kimberley</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples -- Aru Islands (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Creation -- Mythology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Creation -- Mythology -- Aru Islands (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Archeaology -- Western Australia -- East Kimberley</field><field name="subject">Archeaology -- Aru Islands (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Comparative cosmology</field><field name="subject">Politics of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Indigenous world view</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation and contestation of Molokan identities and communities : the Australian experience</field><field name="creator">Slivkoff, Paulina Matvei</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Molokans are a Russian sectarian community that has been a transnational diasporic community since their exile from southern Russia in 1839. During the 1839 exodus they were relocated to Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. These countries make up a region referred to by Molokans as Transcaucasia located in and around the Caucasus Mountains. A further migration to Turkmenistan followed in 1889. Since that time, Molokans have settled in Iran, the United States of America, Mexico, Australia and Brazil. The colonies in Brazil and Mexico have disbanded with members re-joining Molokan communities in the United States of America and Australia. The communities remain in contact with one another and with various Molokan communities still existing in the Russian Soviet Socialist Federal Republic. Molokans are characterised by a religious structure of lay ministers and elders in a traditional, patriarchal social community. They are a collectivity of churches (there is no hierarchy between the churches) and sub-groups who practise varying degrees of adherence to Molokan dogma. They are a millenarian, charismatic religious community similar to Pentecostals and Anabaptists with the exception that they have ceased to evangelise and have become &#8216;closed&#8217; communities practising endogamy. Given their closed structure, relatively little is known about this group in mainstream society . . . Spirituality, in the form of prophecy, healing, and the shared expression of religious ecstasy (rejoicing in the Holy Spirit) provides a sense of communitas that helps to bind the communities. Persecution in Russia and in the United States of America promoted mistrust of outsiders and contributed to the closure of social boundaries. Interventionist and reform activities in both Russia and the United States of America reinforced the belief that social closure was the only way to maintain cultural continuity. Their shared history of migration and persecution contributes to the building of a core community identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Christian sects -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Religious communities -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Russians -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Molokans -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Religious life and customs</field><field name="subject">Molokan</field><field name="subject">Sectarians</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">River response to land clearing and landscape salinisation in southwestern Australia</field><field name="creator">Callow, John Nikolaus</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Land clearing is known to increase runoff, and in many dryland landscapes is also associated with rising saline watertables, causing increased stream salinity and degrading riparian vegetation. The limited understanding of how river morphology responds to these changes and the potential for vegetation-based strategies to offer river management options under these conditions, has prompted this research. In southwestern Australia the severity of salinity and recent nature of land clearing provides an appropriate setting to investigate river response. A data-based, multidisciplinary methodology was applied to determine how land clearing and landscape salinisation has altered landscape sensitivity through changes in erosive potential, system connectivity and material threshold mechanisms, and how these affect patterns of river response. The study investigated the responses of morphologically similar reaches across fifty two study sites in the Kent River and Dalyup River catchments, in the south coastal rivers region of Western Australia. Land clearing was found to have significantly altered the hydrologic regime and erosive potential in both frequency and magnitude, with flow becoming more perennial, and increased annual discharge, flood peaks and bankfull flow frequency. While sediment transport rates have also increased since land clearing, they remain low on a global scale. Human response to a reduced rainfall regime and related water security pressures has caused large hillslope areas to be decoupled from the main channels by bank and farm dam construction, and have reduced downstream transmission of change. ... By contrast, steeper-sloped mid-catchment areas with minimal vegetation degradation caused by salinity are associated with higher erosive potential. A more erosive response is observed in these reaches where floodplains have been cleared for agricultural purposes. A conceptual model of vegetation growth across the salinity gradient observed in the study catchments was developed, and applied to selected river styles to assess the potential that vegetation-based strategies offer for river management. This work identifies the unsuitability of river restoration strategies, but the potential for river restoration or remediation in a saline landscape. Hydraulic modelling demonstrated that river rehabilitation strategies such as improving the vegetation condition of the riparian buffer using native or commercial species on areas elevated above saline flow can stabilise reaches. For river styles in wide and flat valleys, there is limited potential for vegetation-based river rehabilitation under the current salinity gradient. Field observation and modelling suggest that river remediation may offer geomorphic management options in salt-affected reaches through channelisation to lower watertables, and further research on this is warranted. This work found a consistent response for river styles across the two study catchments. Based on the understanding of river response and the potential for vegetation-based river management for each style, this research offers a regional-scale tool for river management in a saline landscape.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clearing of land -- Western Australia -- South-west</field><field name="subject">Stream salinity -- Western Australia -- South-west</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology -- Western Australia -- South-west</field><field name="subject">Salinity -- Western Australia -- South-west</field><field name="subject">Land degradation -- Western Australia -- South-west</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the end bearing performance of displacement piles in sand</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xiangtao</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The axial performance of piles in sand remains an area of great uncertainty in geotechnical engineering. Over the years, database studies have shown that the existing method for offshore piles (e.g. API 2000) is unreliable. There is therefore a clear need for an improved predictive method, which incorporates the state-ofthe- art understanding of the underlying controlling mechanisms. This Thesis is dedicated to address the factors influencing the end bearing performance of displacement piles in siliceous sand with a view to proposing and justifying an improved design formulation. Firstly, a database of displacement pile load tests in sand with CPT data was compiled in collaboration with James Schneider (Schneider 2007). It features the widest database with also the latest available pile load test data (e.g. Euripides, Ras Tanajib, Drammen etc) in electronic form. Evaluation of the three new CPTbased methods (Fugro-05, ICP-05 &amp; NGI-05) against this database has revealed a broadly similar predictive performance despite their end bearing formulations being remarkably different. This anomaly promoted the author to extend the database to include additional tests with base capacity measurements to form new base capacity databases for driven and jacked piles, which resulted in the UWA- 05 method for end bearing of displacement piles in sand. This method accounts for the pile effective area ratio, differentiates between driven and jacked piles, and employs a rational qc averaging technique. ... Field tests were performed in Shenton Park, Perth to supplement the database study and, in particular, to examine the effect of the incremental filling ratio (IFR). 10 open-ended and 2 closed-ended piles were tested in compression followed by tension. The test results provide strong support for the UWA-05 method for base capacity evaluation employing the CPT qc values and the effective area ratio. A series of jacked pile tests was carried out on the UWA beam centrifuge, to further explore the factors affecting pile base response. In total, four uniform and four layered centrifuge samples were prepared and tested at various stress levels and relative densities using three separate pile diameters. The resistance ratio (qb0.1/qc,avg) is found to be independent of the absolute pile diameter, effective stress and soil relative density. The tests in layered soil enabled quantification of the reduction in penetration resistance when a pile/cone approaches a weak layer and revealed the significant influence on base stiffness of underlying soft clay layers. The stiffness decay curves (G/GIN vs. w/D, where GIN is initial operational shear stiffness) measured in static load tests were found to vary with ratios of GIN/qc, while there was a unique relationship between G/GIN and qb/qc. A detailed parametric study was carried out (using the FE code PLAXIS) by idealising pile penetration using a spherical cavity expansion analogue in layered soil. The numerical predictions compare well with the centrifuge results and their generalization enabled guidelines to be established for end bearing in layered soil.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Axial loads</field><field name="subject">Sand -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Engineering geology</field><field name="subject">Offshore structures</field><field name="subject">End bearing</field><field name="subject">Displacement piles</field><field name="subject">Physical and numerical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational hazards in veterinary practice and possible effects on reproductive outcomes in female veterinarians</field><field name="creator">Shirangi, Adeleh</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Veterinarians have considerable potential for exposure to several known reproductive hazards such as radiation, anaesthetic gases, pesticides, long working hours and occupational stress. Reproductive effects are a concern to female veterinarians, especially now that about 65% of graduates from Australian veterinary science schools are female. In the last two decades, there have been reports on the possible associations between occupational exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in female veterinarians, but most of them have been equivocal and the whole area remains controversial. More evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. The Health Risks of Australian Veterinarians project (HRAV) was conducted as a questionnaire-based survey of all graduates from Australian veterinary schools during the 40-year period 1960-2000. Of 5,748 eligible veterinarians who were sent the questionnaires (73% of the whole cohort), 2,800 replied including 1,197 females (42.8%). Among women veterinarians eligible to participate, 59% participated . . . Identification of these associations may provide the opportunity for preventing harmful exposures and thus reduce the risk of any adverse reproductive outcomes not only for veterinarians, but also for other groups exposed to these risks such as veterinary nurses, animal laboratory technicians, anaesthetists, dentists, dental assistants, and other similar professional groups.

Very little has been done on the tea trade between China and other regions such as colonial Singapore. In addition, the focus on the overseas Chinese community in Singapore has concentrated on two opposite ends of the social ladder  the rich traders or merchants who came to dominate the political, economic and social life of the community, and the coolies or those in the working class and how the harsh reality of life in colonial Singapore often quashed any dreams they had of a better life. The key focus of this dissertation is a study of the trading links between a group of Chinese traders in Singapore and commodity producers in China. To date, research into Chinese traders in Singapore has focussed on their trade in products from British Malaya such as rubber and tin. This dissertation aims to steer away from this approach, and study the relationship between Fujian tea production and trade and the Chinese tea traders in Singapore . . . This dissertation, therefore, takes a two-pronged approach. First, it examines the conditions in Fujian tea production and trade since they were the key trading concerns of the Chinese tea traders in Singapore. Secondly, the dissertation examines the political beliefs and sense of patriotism among the Chinese tea traders in Singapore and their response to major events in their lives such as the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), the Japanese Occupation of Singapore (1942-1945), the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949) and self-government for Singapore from June 1959.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Singapore -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Tea trade -- Singapore -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Tea trade -- China -- Fujian Sheng -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">China -- Commerce -- Singapore -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Singapore -- Commerce -- China -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Tea trade</field><field name="subject">China-Fujian province</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weed seed predation by ants in the crop growing areas of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Minkey, David Mark</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In the crop growing areas of Western Australia, two economically important weed species, Lolium rigidum Gaud. (annual ryegrass) and Raphanus raphanistrum L. (wild radish), have evolved widespread herbicide resistance to multiple chemistry groups. Consequently, grain growers in the region have adopted an integrated approach to weed management that includes many non herbicide tools, however many more are needed as these weed species become increasingly more difficult to control. This thesis examines, in a series of field trials carried out in the Western Australian crop growing area, the potential for weed seed predation of annual ryegrass and wild radish by naturally occurring granivores as a new weed management tool for grain growers . . . The study discusses the implications of these results with the view to manipulating predation of weed seed through agricultural management practices. Ants were shown to be the dominant seed predator in this environment, especially in the centre of fields. The study has identified that the ant species Melophorus turneri (Forel), Monomorium rothsteini (Forel), Pheidole hartmeyeri (Forel) and Rhytidoponera metallica (Smith) are potential biological control agents for annual ryegrass seeds while P. hartmeyeri was identified as the only species suitable for biological control of wild radish seed pods. Ants were found to be sensitive to disturbance and some to crop residue type and these effects are discussed in relation to seed removal. This study of weed seed predation in agricultural fields is the most complete in this environment and can be used to inform further work in this area. It has identified that naturally occurring granivores can be used as a weed management tool.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weeds -- Biological control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Granivores -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Seeds</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Control -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Weeds -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ants -- Behavior</field><field name="subject">Ants</field><field name="subject">Predation</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="subject">Agriculture</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of two modes of exercise on obesity</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Leanne Sue</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of two different modes of exercise in an overweight and obese population over a 12-week period. Subjects: Forty-four overweight or obese individuals were recruited from a weight loss organisation. Participants were randomised into one of two groups which were matched according to age, gender and body mass index (BMI). The interventions consisted of either intermittent interval exercise (INT group), or intermittent steady-state exercise (SS group). Participants in both groups were on an identical strict caloric diet during the intervention period. Methods: Baseline and post-intervention testing consisted of the assessment of aerobic fitness, blood lipid profile, resting metabolism, body composition, vascular function, quality of life and activity levels. The exercise regime for the INT group consisted of a 1:2 min ratio of moderate intensity (70  75% V&amp;O2peak) to low intensity exercise (40  45% V&amp;O2peak), while the SS group exercised continuously between 50  55% V&amp;O2peak. Total work per session was the same per group. Exercise consisted of walking/jogging twice daily for 15 mins five days per week. Eighteen participants dropped out of the study leaving 12 in the INT group and 14 in the SS group. Results: Peak oxygen uptake and exercise time to exhaustion increased significantly over time in the interventions (P &lt; 0.001). Significant positive changes occurred in several blood tests, including liver function, insulin like growth factor (IGF- 1) and lipid levels (cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and coronary risk ratio, all P &lt; 0.05 over time). Additionally, uric acid and VLDL levels significantly decreased over time in the SS and INT groups, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), whereas IGF-1 levels significantly increased in the SS group over time (P &lt; 0.05). Body composition measures, including BMI, body mass, fat mass, percent of body fat, gynoid obesity and hip circumference, as well as waist circumference decreased significantly over time (P &lt; 0.05). Several components of the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire (physical function, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function and mental health) improved significantly over time (P &lt; 0.05), while mental health also significantly improved over time in the SS group (P &lt; 0.01). Finally, anxiety and depression levels were significantly reduced over time (P &lt; 0.05). However, none of these changes over time significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion: Both exercise interventions resulted in significant improvement over time in numerous health and fitness variables in an overweight and obese population. No significant differences were found, in the interaction term during a 2-way ANOVA, between the two groups at post-intervention. A longer intervention period, or changes to interval duration and intensities may result in more significant differences between the two training methods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Interval training</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seed germination and dormancy in south-western Australian fire ephemerals and burial as a factor influencing seed responsiveness to smoke</field><field name="creator">Baker, Katherine S</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Fire ephemerals are pioneer species that germinate in large numbers after fire and generally live for between six months and four years. Seeds produced during the short life span of these plants persist in the soil seedbank until a subsequent fire. This study examined the dormancy characteristics and germination requirements of ten Australian fire ephemeral species from five families. Seeds of four species germinated at one or more incubation temperatures in the laboratory, indicating that a proportion of their seedlots were non-dormant at the time of testing. Austrostipa compressa and Austrostipa macalpinei (Poaceae) produced &gt;80% germination at 10?C and Alyogyne hakeifolia and Alyogyne huegelii (Malvaceae) produced 30-40% and 35-50% germination respectively at 10 to 25&#176;C. In each of the Alyogyne species approximately 50% of seeds were impermeable to water, but scarification did not enable germination of all viable seeds suggesting that seeds which did not germinate, may have possessed physiological dormancy as well as physical dormancy. Remaining species had water permeable seeds. ... Germination of both Alyogyne species declined after six months of winter burial but was enhanced by heat treatments after a further six months of summer burial. Actinotus leucocephalus and Tersonia cyathiflora seeds exhibited annual dormancy cycling over two years of burial. Dormancy was alleviated over summer, allowing seeds of both species to germinate in smoke water when seeds were exhumed in autumn, and reimposed over winter, suppressing germination in spring. In Actinotus leucocephalus these dormancy changes were induced in the laboratory by warm (&#8805;15&#176;C) and cold (5&#176;C) temperatures, alleviating and re-imposing dormancy, respectively. Wetting and drying seeds stored at 37&#176;C further accelerated the rate of dormancy release. This dormancy cycling would increase the likelihood of seeds germinating when moisture availability in south-western Australia is greatest for seedling survival. It also explains the variation in germination response to smoke water observed in many species. Thus under natural conditions dormancy levels of fire ephemerals were altered during soil storage which enabled them to respond to fire-related cues such as heat and smoke water, and germinate in autumn. This information will assist in the use of these species in land rehabilitation and ornamental horticulture, and in the conservation of rare or endangered fire ephemerals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seeds -- Dormancy -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Germination</field><field name="subject">Endemic plants -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Effect of temperature on</field><field name="subject">Dormancy in plants</field><field name="subject">Seed germination</field><field name="subject">Smoke</field><field name="subject">Dormancy</field><field name="subject">Fire ephemeral</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for the detection, purification and characterisation of histone H4 histidine kinase and the analysis of protein histidine phosphorylation</field><field name="creator">Zu, Xin Lin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Protein phosphorylation, one of the most important forms of post-translational modification, has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in regulation of cell function. Phosphorylation of protein serine, threonine and tyrosine residues has been the most thoroughly investigated, taking advantage of the acid-stable character of these phosphohydroxyamino acids. Whereas, the cellular occurrence of acid-labile phosphoamino acids, such as phosphohistidine, phosphoarginine and phospholysine was often underestimated due to the acid treatments employed by most of the traditional phosphoamino acid analysis methods. The biological roles of histidine kinases (HKs) in prokaryotes are well understood in contrast to those of HKs in eukaryotes, especially in mammalian cells. However, the evidence has shown that phosphohistidine comprised 6% of phosphoamino acids of the basic nuclear proteins in eukaryotes (Matthews, 1995) and there was more phosphohistidine than phosphoserine in rat liver mitochondria (Bieber and Boyer, 1966). More significantly, phosphohistidine was revealed to be the major phosphoamino acid in phosphorylated histone H4 in regenerating liver in vivo (Chen et al., 1974) and the Walker-256 carcinosarcoma cells in vitro (Smith et al., 1974). Recently, the histone H4 histidine kinase (HHK) activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumour tissue was measured to be 400 times higher than the normal liver tissue surrounding the tumour. HepG2 cells (HCC cell line) and PIL-2 cells (a p53 knockout mouse tumorigenic liver progenitor cell line) also displayed high HHK activity (Tan et al., 2004). The above observations suggested that HKs and HHKs are playing important roles in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including mammals. One major obstacle in the study of HHK study has been the lack of knowledge of the amino acid sequence of an HHK. Attempts at purifying and identifying the HHK from yeast led to the partial purification of a yeast HHK protein(s) at 32kDa (Huang et al., 1991). However, the amino acid sequence of the HHK has not yet been established. ... The success of the separation was demonstrated by the MALDI-TOF-MS and/or ESI-MS spectra of the RP-HPLC fractions. These achievements suggested that it is possible to detect phosphohistidyl histone H4 in vivo using MS under experimental conditions where phosphohistidine is relatively stable. The study in this thesis represents the progression of HHK research in various aspects, including the yeast HHK purification and identification, mammalian HHK partial purification and the methodological developments in detecting histone H4 histidine phosphorylation using MS. Furthermore, new information regarding the physical characteristics of yeast HHKs and its potential role in cellular biology have been documented. It is anticipated that knowledge generated in these studies will contribute to the insight and the understanding of the biological significance of HHK in yeast and mammalian cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">Histones</field><field name="subject">Phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">Phosphoprotein phosphatases</field><field name="subject">Histone H4 histidine kinase</field><field name="subject">Histidine phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of fish consumption in population-based studies of cancer</field><field name="creator">Mina, Kym Deanne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The role of fish consumption and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the prevention of disease has been the subject of much investigation in recent years. A clue that these factors might be of importance was the observation that populations consuming high levels of marine omega-3 PUFAs had lower rates of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. From there, research in this area has expanded to include a range of chronic diseases and their prevention. An area of particular interest is the role of fish consumption in the prevention of various cancers. In Australia, one in three men and one in four women are expected to be diagnosed with cancer by the age of 75. Identifying preventive factors that can be translated into constructive health promotional messages is of great importance in addressing this group of diseases that has such a large impact on the health and wellbeing of the population. ... Results and conclusions Analysis of the data from the population-based case-control study suggests a protective effect of preserved fish consumption, possibly due to the high oil content of these fish. The developed questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for measuring fish and seafood consumption as determined by regression analysis with an independent biomarker and reliability analysis using intra-class correlation. Importantly, reliability can be maintained despite asking a high level of detail from participants. For ranking according to overall fish consumption, detailed questioning is probably not necessary, however inclusion of variables representing multiple categories of fish and seafood consumption in a regression model enables us to better account for variation in blood omega-3 PUFA levels than a single variable representing overall consumption. For the purpose of questionnaire validation, plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte membrane levels of EPA and DHA are equivalent biomarkers of fish and seafood consumption. The choice between them by future investigators will be based on more practical aspects such as convenience and the fasting state of subjects. The tangible product of this thesis is additional evidence to support a protective association between fish consumption and prostate and breast cancers, and a valid and reliable questionnaire v for measuring habitual consumption of fish and seafood in a West Australian population, that could also be applied to other populations after minor adjustment for local fish and seafood consumption patterns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fish as food -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Medicine, Preventive</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Nutritional aspects</field><field name="subject">Fish consumption</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Semi-quantitative food frequency</field><field name="subject">Validation study</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transpiration as the leak in the carbon factory : a model of self-optimising vegetation</field><field name="creator">Schymanski, Stanislaus Josef</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In the most common (hydrological) viewpoint, vegetation is a</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plants -- Transpiration</field><field name="subject">Evapotranspiration</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Adaptation</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant-water relationships -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Vegetation adaptation</field><field name="subject">Optimality</field><field name="subject">Hydrology</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Water balance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Components of enjoyment in physical education</field><field name="creator">Hashim, Hairul Anuar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Enjoyable physical education (PE) has the potential to promote adolescent involvement in healthy activities outside the school setting. Disturbingly, evidence exists that many students do not enjoy PE and do not believe that it meets their needs. Indeed, a number of studies have documented an age-related decline in PE enjoyment among students. The research reported here is based on the assumption that a deeper understanding of the enjoyment processes could guide researchers and assist teachers in making PE classes more enjoyable for students. Given the fact that enjoyment is a product of multiple processes, a model of enjoyment developed by Scanlan and Lewthwaite (1986) was viewed as a potentially useful framework to guide this research. The validity of this model has been established in youth sport settings. However, further studies are needed to examine the utility of this framework in PE settings. In STUDY 1 (Chapter 3), a measurement instrument was constructed based on the Scanlan and Lewthwaite (1986) model. Content validity of the instrument was established by obtaining feedback from eight experts in psychology and four highly experienced secondary school teachers. ... Moreover, the results of correlation analyses again revealed significant positive relationships between PE teaching processes and enjoyment of PE. Unique findings in this study centered on the specific aspects of PA that were positively related to PE enjoyment. More v specifically, significant positive relationships were also obtained between PE enjoyment and self-reports of exercise duration (min-per-week: r = .30, p &lt;.001), exercise intensity (r = .28, p &lt; .001), exercise habit strength (r = .29, p &lt; .001), and exercise stage-of-change (rho = .23, p &lt; .001). Together, the findings from these studies provide support for the Scanlan and Lewthwaite (1986) model within the PE context. In addition, the findings provide guidance about how PA programs can be structured to maximize student enjoyment of PE. In terms of program structure, student enjoyment may be fostered by considering six processes. These processes are: self-referent competency, other-referent competency, teacher-generated excitement, activity-generated excitement, peer interaction, and parental encouragement. By emphasizing these processes, teachers will not only increase student enjoyment of PE but also increase the likelihood of involvement in PA outside of the school setting. Given global trends toward decreases in PA and increases in obesity, these outcomes could have important benefits for reducing public health costs in future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical education and training -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Teenagers -- Psychology</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Enjoyment</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing local Lorentz invariance in electrodynamics</field><field name="creator">Stanwix, Paul Louis</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis presents the design, construction and operation of a new rotating mod- ern Michelson-Morley test of Lorentz invariance. The experiment measures the isotropy of the speed of light by comparing the frequencies of two orthogonally ori- ented cryogenic sapphire whispering gallery mode resonators. Putative violations of Lorentz invariance will manifest as periodic variations in the difference frequency between the two resonators, related to the changing orientation of the experiment with respect to a preferred cosmological frame. Actively rotating the experiment is advantageous for three reasons. Firstly, by careful selection of the rotation frequency in the laboratory we are able to sample the isotropy of the speed of light at a rate that coincides with the optimal frequency instabilities of the oscillators (18 seconds). Secondly, the statistics of this exper- iment are improved with respect to non-rotating (stationary) experiments, which rely on the motion of the Earth to sample the isotropy of the speed of light. This results from integrating over more periods of rotation per unit of time, compared to the sidereal rotation experienced by stationary experiments. ... Many noise sources and systematic disturbances have been characterized and the operation of the experiment optimized. Two frequencies are generated at 10 GHz with 226 kHz separation, exhibiting a fractional frequency instability of less than 2x10-14 from 5 to 500 seconds. Furthermore, the work includes a detailed analysis of the experiment within the Standard Model Extension and Robertson, Mansouri and Sexl frameworks. The sensitivity of the experiment to violations of Lorentz invariance has been derived in each of these frameworks, for both short data set and the complete full year analysis. The data has been analysed using two separate data analysis techniques, which were optimised for noise present in the data. We have operated the experiment over the course of more than one year, collect- ing data more than 30 percent of the time. By analysing over 1 year of data we were able to set the first independent limits on 8 parameters in the photon sector of the Standard Model Extension as low as 10-16 for Ke- and 10-12 for Ko+ parameters, improving upon previous non-rotating experiments by up to an order of magnitude. We have also set new a new limit on the isotropy parameter PMM = 9.4(8.1)x10-11 of the Robertson, Mansouri and Sexl framework, which is a factor of 25 improvement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Lorentz invariance</field><field name="subject">Michelson-Morley test</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in second language and cognition through the lifespan</field><field name="creator">Chong, Janice Ellen</field><field name="description">Those who work with older people frequently report that people who have learned a second language appear to lose facility in that language as they age. This phenomenon has also been observed by the friends and relatives of those older persons who have learned more than one language. However, there is very little research investigating changes in second (or other) languages across the lifespan. In contrast, extensive research exploring first language change in ageing has provided ample evidence of patterns of change in first language abilities across the lifespan. There is also much research linking these patterns to age-related cognitive change. The question addressed in the first study of this project was whether patterns of age-related change in second language abilities are similar to patterns of change in first language abilities. The performance of English first language and English second language (Chinese first language) participants aged 20 to 79 was compared on four language ability tasks. Information relating to language background, language use, and education was also collected. In general, the patterns of first and second language change across the lifespan were similar with facility in one ability, verbal fluency, decreasing with increased age. Background variables were also found to affect second language ability within the English second language group. The second study investigated whether those processes associated with age-related cognitive decline, and therefore age-related changes in first language, also influence changes in second language verbal fluency in ageing. English second language (Chinese first language) participants aged 20 to 79 performed a number of tasks designed to measure the cognitive constructs of speed of processing, inhibitory efficiency, and working memory capacity. The effect of age on verbal fluency in second language was mediated by speed of processing. There was no evidence of reduced inhibitory efficiency with increased age. Scores from the working memory capacity tasks could not be analysed due to the involuntary and unexpected intrusion of their Chinese language for some bilingual participants. The results were interpreted in terms of fluid and crystallised intelligence, and also the differences in bilingual compared to monolingual language processing.  Implications for testing and assessment of individuals in their non-native language are discussed, and both the limitations of the research and also possible future research directions are identified.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition -- Age factors</field><field name="subject">Language attrition</field><field name="subject">Language change</field><field name="subject">Second language</field><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal mixing in a mine lake</field><field name="creator">Huber, Anita</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mine lakes are a water body created after an open-cut mine ceases operating. The lakes develop in the former mine-pit due to the combination of groundwater inflow, surface run-off and, in some cases, due to rapid filling from river diversion. While potentially valuable water resources, these lakes often have poor water quality and managing the water body is an important part of the overall process of mine site rehabilitation. As mine lakes form in man-made pits, they have a bathymetry that is typically quite distinct from natural lakes and this can, in turn, strongly influence the hydrodynamics and hence the water quality of the water body. Despite the potential importance of these water bodies, there have been very few studies on the hydrodynamics of mine lakes. This study describes a field investigation of the hydrodynamics of a former coal mine lake, Lake Kepwari, in south-western Western Australia. In particular, this study examines the hydrodynamic processes in both the surface mixing layers and the internal mixing in the density stratified lake. Wind sheltering in the surface mixing layer occurs due to the presence of the steep walls and lake embankments. A week long field experiment was conducted in December 2003 using a combination of moored thermistor chains with meteorological stations and the deployment of rapid vertical profiling turbulent microstructure instruments and CTD drops from two boats operating on the lake. ... Simulations indicated that inclusion of a site specific sheltering effect, based on the results of the field campaign, significantly improved the models&#8216; performance in capturing the surface mixed layer deepening associated with episodic strong wind events that occur on the lake. Considerable internal mixing was indicated by the high dissipation rates observed, particularly near the boundaries. Large basin-wide diffusivities were also calculated from the heat budget method over long periods, showed a consistency with time, and were slightly higher in summer than during the Autumn  Winter period. Although light, there are persistent winds over the lake and yet little basin-scale internal wave activity or seiching. It is hypothesized that any seiching motion was rapidly damped by strong mixing over the hydraulically rough bathymetry  bathymetry created by the remnant benches from the open cut mining operation itself. This boundary mixing, in turn, drives secondary relaxation currents that transport mixed fluid from the boundaries to the interior, resulting in high effective basin-wide diffusivities. A simple boundary mixing model is proposed to describe this process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Coal mines and mining</field><field name="subject">Strip mine ponds -- Western Australia -- Management</field><field name="subject">Mixing -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Water quality</field><field name="subject">Mine lake</field><field name="subject">Turbulence</field><field name="subject">Field investigations</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organisation of timber production in the hardwood forests of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Hartley, Arthur E</field><field name="description">Chapter 1.

This rising incidence cannot be completely explained by changes in genetic factors or by improvements in diagnostic procedures. Environmental factors, particularly those associated with a westernised lifestyle, are considered to be involved in this increase. In the late 1980&#8217;s Strachan was the first to link environmental factors with allergic disease, this theory became to be known as the  &#8216;hygiene hypothesis&#8217;. This hypothesis links the &#8220;cleaner&#8221; more  &#8220;healthy &#8221; environment we now live in, with an increased risk of developing allergic disease. This effect is highlighted by studies linking farm and animal exposure (rich in microbial compounds) during early life with a decrease in allergic disease. Since then numerous studies have been undertaken to ascertain the factors present in the microbe rich environment, which elicit this protective effect. Many studies have revolved around endotoxin, however microbial components (mainly from Gram-positive bacteria) which signal through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), have also shown that they can alter the allergic immune response. In mice models TLR2 has been shown to both exacerbate and inhibit allergic disease. The above research highlights the need for further studies into the effect of TLR2 ligands, and to define the mechanisms by which they exert their effects in human allergic disease. These mechanisms will be relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of allergy, but also might provide novel ways to treat allergy. The aims of the study outlined in this thesis were to determine whether in vitro exposure to TLR2 ligands could modify the established immune response to house dust mite allergen (HDM), and to examine the mechanisms by which this occurs. ... The addition of glucocorticoids to LTA enhanced the ability of this TLR2 ligand to inhibit IL-5 and IL-13 production by HDM-activated blood mononuclear cells. In conclusion, this study shows that TLR2 ligands have the ability to inhibit the Th2 response to mite allergen in previously sensitized individuals by an as yet unknown mechanism. However the findings described herein do provide an impetus for future studies designed to uncover novel mechanisms by which allergic responses can be ameliorated, and may open new treatment modalities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">House dust mites</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Toll-like receptor (TLR)</field><field name="subject">Th2 cytokines</field><field name="subject">Allergy</field><field name="subject">Atopy</field><field name="subject">Innate immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The virtual time function and rate-based schedulers for real-time communications over packet networks</field><field name="creator">Devadason, Tarith Navendran</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The accelerating pace of convergence of communications from disparate application types onto common packet networks has made quality of service an increasingly important and problematic issue. Applications of different classes have diverse service requirements at distinct levels of importance. Also, these applications offer traffic to the network with widely variant characteristics. Yet a common network is expected at all times to meet the individual communication requirements of each flow from all of these application types. One group of applications that has particularly critical service requirements is the class of real-time applications, such as packet telephony. They require both the reproduction of a specified timing sequence at the destination, and nearly instantaneous interaction between the users at the endpoints. The associated delay limits (in terms of upper bound and variation) must be consistently met; at every point where these are violated, the network transfer becomes worthless, as the data cannot be used at all. In contrast, other types of applications may suffer appreciable deterioration in quality of service as a result of slower transfer, but the goal of the transfer can still largely be met. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of a class of packet scheduling algorithms in meeting the specific service requirements of real-time applications in a converged network environment. Since the proposal of Weighted Fair Queueing, there have been several schedulers suggested to be capable of meeting the divergent service requirements of both real-time and other data applications. ... This simulation study also sheds light on false assumptions that can be made about the isolation produced by start-time and finish-time schedulers based on the deterministic bounds obtained. The key contributions of this work are as follows. We clearly show how the definition of the virtual time function affects both delay bounds and delay distributions for a real-time flow in a converged network, and how optimality is achieved. Despite apparent indications to the contrary from delay bounds, the simulation analysis demonstrates that start-time rate-based schedulers possess useful characteristics for real-time flows that the traditional finish-time schedulers do not. Finally, it is shown that all the virtual time rate-based schedulers considered can produce isolation problems over multiple hops in networks with high loading. It becomes apparent that the benchmark First-Come-First-Served scheduler, with spacing and call admission control at the network ingresses, is a preferred arrangement for real-time flows (although lower priority levels would also need to be implemented for dealing with other data flows).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real-time data processing -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Packet scheduler in data networks</field><field name="subject">Virtual time function</field><field name="subject">Isolation</field><field name="subject">Delay</field><field name="subject">Real-time applications</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparatory strategies for optimising an all-out sprint effort</field><field name="creator">Mohd Sani Madon</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The inclusion of a warm-up in the form of prior exercise (PE) is generally advocated as a preparatory strategy of choice to improve sprint performance. Although there is evidence that both increasing muscle temperature and mobilising the cardiorespiratory system prior to exercise contribute largely to the benefit of PE on sprint performance, their relative importance is unknown. Another important question relates to situations where an athlete has to engage in a sprint shortly after one or several earlier sprints. Under these conditions, is engaging in mild exercise also the most effective preparatory strategy to adopt prior to sprinting when performed after a previous sprint(s)? It was the primary aim of this thesis to address these questions. Firstly, we hypothesised that there is a temporal shift in the mechanisms responsible for the effect of PE on power output during a maximal sprint effort, with temperature-dependent mechanisms playing a more important role at the onset of the sprint and mobilisation of the cardiorespiratory system playing a more important role later. To test this hypothesis, we compared the responses of a 30-s sprint to different PE protocols designed to control for either muscle temperature or pre-exercise VO2. ... A group of trained athletes was subjected to four consecutive bouts of 30-s sprint, each separated by 20 min of either active recovery at 40% VO2 peak or passive recovery. Our results show that PP, MP-20 and MP-10 did not fall between the first and last sprints, and were not affected by active recovery. In contrast, we found that MP10 and MP30 decrease significantly between the first and last sprint of the passive recovery trial, but not when active recovery is performed between consecutive sprints. Finally, this study also showed that the fall in mean power associated with repeated 30-s sprints in the passive recovery trial resulted primarily from a fall in early, but not late power output. These findings show that the early and late mean power output of repeated sprints respond differently to active and passive recovery, with the decrease in total mean power with repeated 30-s sprints resulting primarily from a fall in early as opposed to either late power output or peak power, thus highlighting the benefit of active recovery as a favourable preparatory strategy for the performance of repeated sprints of short (&lt;10s) or longer duration (&lt;30s), but not for repeated peak power.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Sprinting -- Training</field><field name="subject">Sprint</field><field name="subject">Warm up</field><field name="subject">Active recovery</field><field name="subject">Passive recovery</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling urban stormwater disposal systems for their future management and design</field><field name="creator">Stovold, Matthew R</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]This thesis investigates aspects of urban stormwater modeling and uses a small urban catchment (NE38) located in the suburb of Nedlands in Perth, Western Australia to do so. The MUSIC (Model for Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation) model was used to calibrate catchment NE38 using measured stormwater flows and rainfall data from within the catchment. MUSIC is a conceptual model designed to model stormwater flows within urban environments and uses a rainfall-runoff model adapted to generate results at six minute time steps. Various catchment scenarios, including the use of porous asphalt as an alternative road surface, were applied to the calibrated model to identify effective working stormwater disposal systems that differ from the current system. Calibrating catchment NE38 using the MUSIC model was attempted and this involved matching modeled stormwater flows to stormwater flows measured at the catchment drainage point. This was achieved by measuring runoff contributing areas (roads) together with rainfall data measured from within the catchment and altering the seepage constant parameter for all roadside infiltration sumps. ... The MUSIC model generated future scenario outcomes for alternative stormwater disposal systems that displayed similar or improved levels of performance with respect to the current system. The following scenarios listed in increasing order of effectiveness outline future stormwater disposal systems that may be considered in future urban design. 1. 35% porous asphalt application with no sumps in 2036 2. 35% porous asphalt application with no sumps in 2064 3. 68% porous asphalt application with no sumps in 2036 4. 68% porous asphalt application with no sumps in 2064. Future scenarios using the current stormwater disposal system (with roadside infiltration sumps) with porous asphalt were also run. These scenarios reduced stormwater runoff and contaminant loading on the catchment drainage point however the inclusion of a roadside infiltration sump system may not appeal to urban designers due to the costs involved with this scenario. Climate change will affect the design of future stormwater disposal systems and thus, the design of these systems must consider a rainfall reducing future. Based on the findings of this thesis, current stormwater runoff volumes entering catchment drainage points can be reduced together with contaminant loads in urban environments that incorporate porous asphalt with a stormwater disposal design system that is exclusive of roadside infiltration sumps.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Storm sewers</field><field name="subject">Sewage disposal -- Management</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff -- Management</field><field name="subject">Urban runoff -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Urban stormwater</field><field name="subject">Catchment</field><field name="subject">Modeling</field><field name="subject">Infiltration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial, temporal and biogeochemical dynamics of submarine groundwater discharge in a semi-enclosed embayment</field><field name="creator">Loveless, Alicia Maree</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It has become widely apparent throughout the world that the discharge of nitrogen contaminated groundwater is reducing surface water quality of marine coastal waters, and is subsequently contributing to the decline of benthic habitats such as seagrasses. A process-based understanding of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has lagged behind these impacts, and this lack of understanding is addressed by this thesis. This thesis, of the spatial and temporal complexity of SGD, has uncovered and answered questions regarding the sources, fate and transport of SGD in a complex coastal discharge environment. Radium isotope techniques, groundwater biogeochemical investigations and HAMSOM surface water modelling have identified the magnitude, transport and fate of SGD in Cockburn Sound, a semienclosed embayment in Western Australia. A temporal periodicity that encompassed end-of-winter, early-summer, late-summer and mid-winter regimes of hydrology and oceanography, was employed in field studies that spanned the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. ... The fate of the groundwater in the semi-enclosed embayment was investigated using knowledge of surface water currents. Localised regions of high groundwater influence were identified in the surface waters of the embayment, and through the application of a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model (HAMSOM) it was discovered that, despite similar total volume residence times, variation in the surface flow regime resulted in very different fates for groundwater discharged to the embayment. For three of the four investigated seasonal regimes, groundwater discharged at the shoreline was shown to be rapidly exported out of the embayment (within approximately 1-3 days). During mid-winter very different wind and current regimes existed, resulting in the lateral transport of shoreline groundwater across the embayment, presenting potential for nutrient recirculation within the system for longer time periods (10+ days). Lateral transport of groundwater during mid-winter from the limestone region of the coastline, may contribute to peaks in phytoplankton biomass that have been reported to occur at this time. The investigations into spatial, temporal and biogeochemical dynamics of SGD provided for further dissertation of the processes that affect these dynamics, at a scale that was relevant to marine embayments, coastal aquifers and the coastal ecosystem. It is hoped that this thesis will contribute to a better understanding of the inputs, dynamics and impacts of SGD on coastal ecosystems and lead to improved management strategies for coastal zones.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Hydrogeology -- Western Australia -- Cockburn Sound</field><field name="subject">Groundwater ecology</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Pollution -- Western Australia -- Cockburn Sound</field><field name="subject">Groundwater disposal in rivers, lakes, etc. -- Western Australia -- Cockburn Sound</field><field name="subject">Submarine groundwater discharge</field><field name="subject">Cockburn Sound</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic endeavours in carbohydrates</field><field name="creator">Scaffidi, Adrian</field><field name="description">The overwhelming occurrence and structural diversity of carbohydrates in Nature indicate their importance in a range of fundamental life processes. Indeed, it is this diversity that has lead to the two equally diverse groups of carbohydrate-processing enzymes, namely the glycoside hydrolases and glycosyl transferases. Thus, understanding the role of both carbohydrates and their processing enzymes in biological systems has attracted significant attention. This thesis, firstly, describes endeavours towards the synthesis of an inositol ?- amino acid, along with a series of sugar &#945;-substituted carboxylic acid esters, utilising an extension of the modified Corey-Link reaction. The emphasis of the thesis is then shifted towards the synthesis of a putative inhibitor of a family GH26 lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum (CtLic26A). The preparation of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-&#946;-laminarbiosyl fluoride 1 is described, along with elaboration into oligosaccharides utilising AbgE358G glycosynthase technology. Crystallographic investigations indicated that the transition state adopted by CtLic26A is in stark contrast to that utilised by the related family GH26 mannanase from Pseudomonas cellulose (Man26A). ...  Following on from this work, expanding the role of the AbgE358G glycosynthase acceptor repertoire to accommodate inositol substrates was explored, furthering the synthetic utility of this enzyme. Thus, a number of inositol acceptors bearing an aryl anchor, for example 2, were prepared and shown to be surrogates for carbohydrate acceptors. ... The thesis then describes the synthesis of an acetamide derivative of 1-epivalienamine, namely 3, a putative inhibitor of &#946;-N-acetylglucosaminidases. Both the synthesis of 3, along with kinetic data for four &#946;-N-acetylglucosaminidases, is reported; as well, Western blot analysis indicated no inhibition of a recombinant OGTase. ... Related to the preparation of a putative inhibitor of &#946;-N-acetylglucosaminidases was the synthesis of a conformationally rigid carbocycle derivative of PUGNAc 4, along with two other derivatives 5 and 6. These compounds were also tested against four &#946;-N-acetylglucosaminidases and a recombinant OGTase. ...  Finally, the synthesis of a mechanism-based inhibitor of family GH3 &#946;-Nacetylglucosaminidases, namely 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-5-fluoro-&#946;-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride 7, is described.

During the early stages of B-cell development CR2/CD21 is silenced. Expression is initiated on immature B-cells escaping negative selection. During peripheral maturation CR2/CD21 is up-regulated with B-cell sub-populations showing distinctive surface levels (comparatively low, intermediate or high). CR2/CD21 is silenced upon terminal plasmacytic differentiation. Appropriate timing and expression level of CR2/CD21 is important for the development of a healthy B-cell repertoire. Previous studies have identified sequences within the proximal promoter and first intron of CR2/CD21 that cooperate within native chromatin to control cell-specific silencing. Further, analysis of cultured human cells has revealed chromatin structural variation causing DNase I hypersensitivity at these regulatory sites in a CR2/CD21-expressing mature B-cell line (Raji) which are absent in a non-lymphoid cell type (K562). The primary focus of the present study involved characterising chromatin structural variation over previously recognized DNase I hypersensitive regions at the CR2/CD21 locus in human cells to understand how chromatin structure might regulate developmental expression of CR2/CD21. ... These studies provide evidence that notch signaling influences CR2/CD21 expression in human cell lines. First, in vivo binding of CBF1 to CR2/CD21 sequences in the proximal promoter and CRS implies that CR2/CD21 is a direct target of notch activation. Second, the effect of exogenous notch signalling molecules on CR2/CD21 proximal promoter activity was modulated by factors binding tandem E-boxes near the transcriptional start site suggesting that the notch pathway may also influence CR2/CD21 expression via control of HLH molecules. Third, initiation of CR2/CD21 expression was observed in a nonexpressing pre-B cell line (Reh) by co-culture with stromal cells expressing a notch ligand (OP9-DL) but not control stroma (OP9-GFP). Together, these findings support a role for notch regulation of B-cell maturation and invite speculation that initiation of CR2/CD21 expression following negative selection of immature B-cells involves crosstalk between HLH transcriptional regulators and the notch pathway. Furthermore, the Reh/OP9-DL co-culture system may provide a model to directly study the relationship between cell signalling molecules, transcription factor regulation, chromatin structural variation and differentiation of B-cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromatin</field><field name="subject">Glycoproteins -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Genetic transcription -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="subject">Chromatin structure</field><field name="subject">B-cell differentiation</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional regulation</field><field name="subject">Notch signal transduction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern concepts in plate osteosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Stoffel, Karl Kilian</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Renewed interest in the fixation of fractures using plates has been stimulated by an improved understanding of the biology of fracture healing and a drive towards minimally invasive surgery. This has led to a change in the way we use plates nowadays and the way in which we build the bone-plate construct, as well as the development of new implants better suited to these techniques. As a result of this, we have now the potential to safely expand the indications for plate fixation especially in the management of fractures in osteopenic bone. This thesis provides scientific evidence allowing for better formulation of the optimum way to use the modern plating systems in the clinical setting. Biological fracture repair with conventional plates, in terms of a less rigid construct to enhance fracture healing, is becoming increasingly popular. By omitting screws the construct becomes more flexible with a risk of fixation failure. It was the aim of the first paper to investigate in an experimental model the construct strength of different conventional plate lengths and number / position of the screws, and if an oblique screw at the plate end could increase the fixation strength. Our data suggest that the plate length is the most important factor in withstanding forces in cantilever bending. Longer plates with an equal number of screws require greater peak loads to failure than short plates with more screws. Furthermore, an oblique screw at the plate end produces an increased strength of fixation in all different test setups. However, the difference is more significant in shorter plates and in constructs with no screw omission adjacent to the fracture site. ... Following cyclic loading, however, locking plates can better retain fracture reduction compared to compression plates. On the other hand, under torsional load the compression plate appears to be biomechanical superior to the locking system. In supracondylar comminuted femur fractures, combining the two principles results in less plastic deformation, and a higher load to failure compared to their single application. The last two papers examine the behaviour of locking plates in osteopenic bone. In cadaveric intra-articular calcaneal fractures, the locking plate showed a significantly lower irreversible deformation during cyclic loading and a significantly higher load to failure. In dorsal and volar fixed angle distal radius constructs in a cadaveric model, all constructs showed adequate stability with minimal deformation on fatigue testing under physiological conditions in good bone quality. In osteoporotic bone, however, dorsal fixed angle constructs are stiffer and stronger than volar constructs. The addition of a styloid plate to a volar plate does not significantly improve stability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone plates (Orthopedics)</field><field name="subject">Fractures -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Internal fixation in fractures</field><field name="subject">Fracture fixation</field><field name="subject">Plate osteosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the modified Cramer Rao bound for burst mode symbol clock synchronisation</field><field name="creator">Doan, John</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an analysis of the Modified Cramer Rao Bound (MCRB) for synchroniser performance in burst mode communication applications.

Both continuous and discrete time systems are considered, in one and two-dimensions. First the frequency weighted balanced model reduction problem is formulated, then a novel frequency weighted, balanced, model reduction method for continuous time systems is proposed. This method is based on the retention of frequency weighted Hankel singular values of the original system, and yields stable reduced order models even when two sided weightings are employed. An alternative frequency weighted balanced model reduction technique (applicable for controller reduction applications) is then developed. This is based on a parametrized combination of the frequency weighted partial fraction expansion technique with balanced truncation and the singular perturbation approximation techniques. This method yields stable models even when two sided weightings are employed. An a priori error bound for the model reduction method is derived. Lower frequency response errors and error bounds are obtained using free parameters and equivalent anti-stable weightings. Based on the same idea, a novel parameterized frequency weighted optimal Hankel norm model reduction method with a tighter a priori error bound is proposed. The proposed methods are extended to include discrete time systems. A frequency interval Gramians based stability preserving model reduction scheme with error bounds is also presented. In this case, frequency weights are not explicitly predefined. Discrete time system related results are also included. Several frequency weighted model reduction results for two-dimensional (2-D) systems are also proposed. The advantages of these schemes include error bounds, guaranteed stability and applicability to general stable (non-separable denominator) weighting functions. Finally, a novel 2-D identification based frequency weighted model reduction scheme is outlined. Numerically robust algorithms based on square root and balancing free techniques are proposed for frequency weighted balanced truncation techniques. Several practical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linear time invariant systems</field><field name="subject">Discrete-time systems</field><field name="subject">Linear systems</field><field name="subject">Control theory</field><field name="subject">Model reduction</field><field name="subject">Controller reduction</field><field name="subject">Frequency weights</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometrically-defined curves in Riemannian manifolds</field><field name="creator">Popiel, Tomasz</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis is concerned with geometrically-defined curves that can be used for interpolation in Riemannian or, more generally, semi-Riemannian manifolds. As in much of the existing literature on such curves, emphasis is placed on manifolds which are important in computer graphics and engineering applications, namely the unit 3-sphere S3 and the closely related rotation group SO(3), as well as other Lie groups and spheres of arbitrary dimension. All geometrically-defined curves investigated in the thesis are either  higher order variational curves, namely critical points of cost functionals depending on (covariant) derivatives of order greater than 1, or  defined by geometrical algorithms, namely generalisations to manifolds of algorithms from the field of computer aided geometric design. Such curves are needed, especially in the aforementioned applications, since interpolation methods based on applying techniques of classical approximation theory in coordinate charts often produce unnatural interpolants. However, mathematical properties of higher order variational curves and curves defined by geometrical algorithms are in need of substantial further investigation:  higher order variational curves are solutions of complicated nonlinear differential equations whose properties are not well-understood;  it is usually unclear how to impose endpoint derivative conditions on, or smoothly piece together, curves defined by geometrical algorithms. This thesis addresses these difficulties for several classes of curves. ... The geometrical algorithms investigated in this thesis are generalisations of the de Casteljau and Cox-de Boor algorithms, which define, respectively, polynomial B'ezier and piecewise-polynomial B-spline curves by dividing, in certain ratios and for a finite number of iterations, piecewise-linear control polygons corresponding to finite sequences of control points. We show how the control points of curves produced by the generalised de Casteljau algorithm in an (almost) arbitrary connected finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold M should be chosen in order to impose desired endpoint velocities and (covariant) accelerations and, thereby, piece the curves together in a C2 fashion. A special case of the latter construction simplifies when M is a symmetric space. For the generalised Cox-de Boor algorithm, we analyse in detail the failure of a fundamental property of B-spline curves, namely C2 continuity at (certain) knots, to carry over to M.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curves</field><field name="subject">Riemannian manifolds</field><field name="subject">Riemannian cubic</field><field name="subject">Bezier curve</field><field name="subject">Lie quadratic</field><field name="subject">B-spline</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CD4? T-cell deficiency and dysfunction in HIV patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Sonia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Failure to fully reconstitute the immune system is a common clinical problem in HIV patients who were severely immunodeficient before responding to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). This can manifest as a deficiency in the number or function of CD4+ T-cells and occurs most often in patients who had a nadir CD4+ T-cell count below 100/&#956;l when CART was commenced. Observational studies of large cohorts of HIV patients, such as the D:A:D study, have demonstrated that patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts have increased rates of death compared with patients who have normal CD4+ T-cell counts. Furthermore, individual case studies suggest that impaired recovery of pathogen-specific immune responses during CART is associated with opportunistic infections or disease progression. This thesis addresses possible causes of deficiencies in CD4+ T-cell number or function in HIV patients who were very immunodeficient prior to treatment and are responding (virologically) to CART. Firstly, the role of the thymus in producing naive CD4+ T-cells and the effects of persistent immune activation on the recovery of CD4+ T-cell numbers were assessed in patients with either low or high CD4+ T-cell counts after long-term CART. ...  Proportions of antigen presenting cell (APC) subpopulations were examined in HIV patients with low or high CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses after long-term CART. HIV patients had significantly lower proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) than HIV-negative controls. Furthermore, the proportions of pDC were positively correlated with CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in HIV patients. Proportions of myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) were significantly higher in HIV patients than controls, and were also increased in patients with low CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses. Proportions of M-DC8+ dendritic cells or CD14+ monocytes did not differ between patients and controls, nor were they associated with CMV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses. Quantitation of cytokine (interferon-&#945;, tumour necrosis factor-&#945;, interleukin (IL) -12, IL-23, IL-15, IL-18 and IL-10) mRNA in unstimulated, purified populations of the APC described above revealed few significant differences between patients with low or high CD4+ T-cell IFN-&#947; responses to CMV. The only notable difference was the slight elevation of IL-15 mRNA levels in patients compared to controls. Since patients in the high responder group had the highest levels of IL-15 mRNA, this association may reflect the anti-apoptotic properties of IL-15. These studies provide valuable insights into the causes of persistent CD4+ T-cell deficiency and dysfunction in HIV patients on CART and may lead to better monitoring and treatments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chermotherapy, Combination</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">T cells -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">CD antigens</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Immunological recovery</field><field name="subject">Antiretroviral therapy</field><field name="subject">CD4+ T-cells</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in Arabidopsis mitochondria</field><field name="creator">Winger, Alison Marie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A range of biotic and abiotic stresses increase levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants due to perturbations of chloroplast and mitochondrial metabolism and the generation of ROS in defence responses. The polyunsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids are susceptible to ROS induced peroxidation yielding various aldehydes, alkenals and hydroxyalkenals including the cytotoxic compound 4-hydroxy- 2-nonenal (HNE). HNE has the potential to cause substantial oxidative damage in cells via its reactivity with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine (Cys) and lipoic acid, the imidazole group of histidine (His) and the ?-amino group of lysine (Lys) protein residues. Analysis of the components of the plant respiratory electron transport chain to HNE revealed a particular susceptibility to inhibition of activity of the alternative oxidase (Aox). Incubation with HNE prevented dimerisation of Aox protein, suggesting that one site of modification was the conserved cysteine residue involved in dimerisation and activation of this enzyme (Cys1). However, a naturally occurring isoform of Aox lacking Cys1 and unable to dimerise, LeAox1b from tomato, was equally sensitive to HNE inhibition, showing that other amino acid residues in Aox also interact with HNE and are likely responsible for inactivation of the enzyme. ... The broader impact of HNE on the whole Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome was examined by use of various 2-dimensional gel separation techniques coupled with use of HNE-adduct antibodies. 32 proteins involved in a number of mitochondrial functions were found to be susceptible to modification by HNE, including components of the electron transport chain, the TCA cycle, as well as proteins involved amino acid metabolism and stress-responses. Implications of modification of these proteins by HNE are discussed. As HNE is produced in vivo during oxidative stress, the profile of mitochondrial targets of HNE was examined from Arabidopsis cell cultures exposed to various oxidative stress inducers. Menadione and hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress throughout the cell, while antimycin A initiated a mitochondrial targeted stress. A differential profile of mitochondrial proteins was observed to be modified by HNE in the various treatments. These results also showed that induction of stress within a whole cell can impact lipid peroxidation within the mitochondria. Overall, this work showed the presence and production of HNE in plant cells, and that HNE, both exogenous and endogenous, has the ability to modify a specific subset of mitochondrial proteins. In several cases this HNE modification was shown to have functional or structural consequences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant cellular control mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Plant defenses</field><field name="subject">Oxidation, Physiological</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis -- Respiration</field><field name="subject">Plant mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Respiration</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling rhizosphere interactions of Burkholderia species</field><field name="creator">Levy, Avram</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Genus Burkholderia encompasses a diverse collection of bacteria that inhabit rhizospheres throughout the world. Species can provide beneficial returns for eukaryotes, such as nitrogen fixation and nodule formation in plants and biocontrol of cropping systems. Burkholderia members can also cause disease in various animals, fungi and plants. These seemingly conflicting characteristics point to the capacity of Burkholderia spp. to interact with diverse eukaryotes. Within terrestrial ecosystems, Burkholderia spp. must negotiate favourable outcomes with both the primary producers and the primary decomposers, namely plants and fungi. It is these ongoing negotiations which govern many rhizosphere processes and lead to niche differentiation for Burkholderia spp. This research set out to design an in vitro model for investigating Burkholderiaeukaryote interactions. Surface and cellular interactions between Burkholderia spp. and both plants and fungi were then investigated. Specifically, mechanisms of adherence and invasion of plant and fungal cells were studied. The Burkholderia spp. B. vietnamiensis and B. pseudomallei were applied to mycorrhizal fungus spores as well as to several plant species. Bacterial inoculation had varying effects on germination of plant and fungal dormant forms. B. vietnamiensis-inoculation consistently increased Gigaspora decipiens spore germination, while B. pseudomallei produced no significant change. The effect of B. vietnamiensis on Acacia colei seed germination was density dependant, resulting in either increases or decreases in seed germination rates. ...  Detection of B. pseudomallei in surface waters and soils was improved by the use of a rapid on-site molecular method. The related species B. thailandensis and B. ubonensis were also cultured from northern Western Australia. Mycorrhizal spores were isolated from soils of melioidosis-endemic regions. Burkholderia spp., including B. pseudomallei and B. vietnamiensis were detected in extracts of these mycorrhizal spores. Therefore, associations of Burkholderia spp. with mycorrhizal spores extend beyond the in vitro setting. These studies have increased our understanding of several specific interactions between Burkholderia spp. and eukaryotes of the rhizosphere. Common themes in adherence and invasion have emerged. Burkholderia spp. are able to closely associate with eukaryotes and to gain access to protected niches. Such access helps to explain the persistence of these bacteria in the environment during periods of desiccation and nutrient limitation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Rhizobacteria</field><field name="subject">Rhizosphere</field><field name="subject">Burkholderia</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="subject">Gigaspora</field><field name="subject">Rhizosphere interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of threshold nonlinearities on the transformation of rainfall to runoff to floods in a lake dominated catchment system</field><field name="creator">Kusumastuti, Dyah Indriana</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Runoff generation behaviour and flooding in a lake dominated catchment are nonlinear, threshold-driven processes that result from the interactions between climate and various catchment characteristics. A complicating feature of the rainfall to runoff transformation, which may have implications for the flood frequency, is that the various surface and subsurface flow pathways are dynamic, heterogeneous and highly nonlinear, consisting of distinct thresholds. To understand the impact of threshold nonlinearities on the rainfall-runoff transformation in such catchments, a systematic examination was carried out to investigate runoff generation behaviour of the catchment itself, the overflow behaviour of a lake in combination with the catchment draining into it, as well as the lake organisation within a lake chain network. Three storage based thresholds were considered: the catchment field capacity storage governing catchment subsurface stormflow, total storage capacity governing catchment surface runoff, and lake storage capacity governing lake-overflow. ... Through these investigations, this thesis has provided valuable insights into the process controls of lake-overflow events and the associated flood frequency behaviour in lake dominated catchments. In particular, the relative roles of climate, soil depth, the soil?s drainage capacity, as well as the relative geometry of the lake vis a vis the contributing catchment, in the determination of the dynamic characteristics of lake-overflow events and associated flood frequency behaviour have been highlighted. In addition, the importance of lake organization, as expressed in terms of the average ratio of catchment area to lake area and the spatial variability of this ratio from upstream to downstream, and their impact upon connectivity and flood frequency have also been explored. The outcomes of this study highlight the importance of thresholds governing flood frequency, and provide insights into the complex interactions between rainfall variability and the various threshold nonlinearities in the rainfall-runoff process, which are shown to have a significant impact on the resulting flood frequency curves. The improved understanding of these process controls will be useful in assisting the 1 management of the catchment-lake system in the study region, and in regions elsewhere. In particular, the outcome of this study can provide guidance towards the adoption of various management strategies for lake chain systems by illustrating the effects of potential flow interruption and retardation as ways to assist in flood prevention and mitigation, whether it is aimed at decreasing the frequency of occurrence of lake overflows, or merely decreasing the flow magnitude for a given return period.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lakes</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">Floods</field><field name="subject">Runoff</field><field name="subject">Hydrologic cycle</field><field name="subject">Threshold</field><field name="subject">Nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">Flood frequency</field><field name="subject">Threshold filtering</field><field name="subject">Lake chain</field><field name="subject">Connectivity</field><field name="subject">Lake overflow</field><field name="subject">Catchment hydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of lipoprotein transport in the metabolic syndrome : impact of statin therapy</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Esther M. M.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The metabolic syndrome is characterized by cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, visceral obesity, hypertension and diabetes. The dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome includes elevated plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels, accumulation of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration. However, the precise mechanisms for this dyslipoproteinemia, specifically low plasma HDL cholesterol, are not well understood. This thesis therefore, focuses on HDL, its structure, function and metabolism. However, lipoprotein metabolism is a complex interconnected system, which includes forward and reverse cholesterol transport pathways. Hence, this thesis also examines and discusses the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. This thesis tests the general hypothesis that apolipoprotein kinetics are altered in the metabolic syndrome, and that lipid regulating therapies can improve these kinetic abnormalities. The aims were first, to compare and establish the clinical, metabolic and kinetic differences between metabolic syndrome and lean subjects; and second, to determine the regulatory effects of statin therapy, specifically, rosuvastatin on lipoprotein transport in the metabolic syndrome. Five observation statements were derived from the general hypothesis and examined in the studies described below. The findings are presented separately as a series of original publications. Study 1 Twelve men with the metabolic syndrome and ten lean men were studied in a case-control setting. ... These findings explain the HDL raising effects of rosuvastatin in the metabolic syndrome. Collectively, these studies suggest that the dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome results from increased production rates of VLDL and LDL particles, reduced fractional catabolic rates of these lipoproteins, together with accelerated catabolism of HDL particles. Treatment with rosuvastatin increases the catabolic rates of all apoB-containing lipoproteins and at a higher dose, decreases LDL apoB production. These effects are consistent with inhibition of cholesterol synthesis leading to an upregulation of LDL receptors. Rosuvastatin decreases the fractional catabolism of HDL particles. The effects of rosuvastatin on HDL kinetics may be related to a reduction in triglyceride concentration and cholesterol ester transfer protein activity. These findings are consistent with the general hypothesis that apolipoprotein kinetics are altered in the metabolic syndrome, and that statin therapy improves these kinetic abnormalities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Lipoproteins -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">High density lipoproteins</field><field name="subject">Apolipoproteins</field><field name="subject">Statins (Cardiovascular agents)</field><field name="subject">Lipoprotein kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnostic imaging pathways</field><field name="creator">Dhillon, Ravinder</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Hypothesis: There is deficiency in the evidence base and scientific underpinning of existing diagnostic imaging pathways (DIP) for diagnostic endpoints.

Methods: 78 common clinical presentations were chosen for development of DIP. For general practitioners, clinical topics were selected based on the following criteria: common clinical problem, complex in regards to options available for imaging, subject to inappropriate imaging resulting in unnecessary expenditure and /or radiation exposure, and new options for imaging of which general practitioners may not be aware. For hospital based junior doctors and medical students, additional criteria included: acute presentation when immediate access to expert radiological opinion may be lacking and clinical problem for which there is a need for education. Systematic review of the literature in relation to each of the 78 topics was carried out using Ovid, Pubmed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. ... The electronic environment and the method of delivery provided a satisfactory medium for dissemination. Getting DIP implemented required vigorous effort. Knowledge of diagnostic imaging and requesting behaviour tended to become more aligned with DIP following a period of intensive marketing. Conclusions: Systematic review of literature and input and feedback from various clinicians and radiologists led to the development of 78 consensus based Diagnostic Imaging Pathways supported by evidence. These pathways are a valuable decision support tool and are a definite step towards incorporating evidence based medicine in patient management. The clinical and academic content of DIP is of practical use to a wide range of clinicians in hospital and general practice settings.

Through experiments in microsphere solutions, we show that static speckle contains information about local particle density when the effective number of scatterers in the OCT resolution volume is less than about five. This potentially provides contrast enhancement in OCT images based on local scatterer density, and we discuss the experimental conditions suited to utilising this in biological tissue. We also describe the corrupting effects of multiple scattering, a ubiquitous phenomenon in OCT, on the information content of the static speckle. Consequently, we detail the development of polarisation-based metrics for characterising multiple scattering in OCT images of solid biological tissues. We exploit a detection scheme used for polarisation-sensitive contrast for a new purpose. We present experiments demonstrating the behaviour of these metrics in liquid phantoms, and in biological tissues, ranging from homogeneous non-birefringent to highly heterogeneous and birefringent samples. We discuss the conditions under which these metrics could be used to characterise the relative contribution of single and multiple scattering and, thus, aid in the study of penetration depth limits in OCT. We present a study of a new contrast mechanism - dynamic elastography which seeks to determine the dynamic mechanical properties of tissues. We present a framework for describing the OCT signal in samples undergoing vibrations, and perform experiments at vibration frequencies in the order of tens to hundreds of Hertz, to confirm the theory, and demonstrate the modes of measurement possible with this technique. These modes of measurement, including acoustic amplitude-sweep and frequency-sweep, could provide new information about the local mechanical properties of a sample. We describe a technological advancement enabling, in principle, measurements of local tissue refractive index contrast much deeper within a sample, than is possible with conventional OCT imaging. The design is based on measurement of the optical path length through tissue filling a fixed-width channel situated at the tip of a needle. The needle design and calibration is presented, as well as measurements of scattering phantoms and various biological tissues.

(1998, 1999). While it has been acknowledged that the REW approach and the associated balance equations can be the basis for the development of a new generation of distributed physically based hydrological models, four building blocks have been identified as necessary to transform the REW approach into, at the very least least, a workable modelling framework beyond the theoretical achievements. These are: 1) the development of reasonable closure relations for the mass exchange fluxes within and between various REW sub-regions that effectively parameterize the effects of sub-REW heterogeneity of climatic and landscape properties, 2) the design of numerical algorithms capable of generating numerical solutions of the REW-scale balance equations composed of a set of coupled ordinary differential and algebraic equations for the number of REWs constituting a study catchment and the sub-regions within the REWs, 3) applications of the resulting numerical model to real catchments to assess its performance in the prediction of any specified hydrological variables, and 4) the assessment of the model reliability through estimation of model predictive uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. This thesis is aimed at making substantial progress in developing each of these building blocks. Chapter 1 presents the background and motivation for the thesis, while Chapter 2 summarizes its main contributions. Chapter 3 presents a description of the closure problem that the REW approach faces, and presents and implements various approaches to develop closure relations needed for the completeness of balance equations of the REW approach. ...  In addition, Chapter 4 also shows an initial application of CREW to a small catchment, Susannah Brook in the south-west of Western Australia. Chapter 5 presents the application of CREW to two meso-scale catchments in Australia, namely Collie and Howard Springs, located in contrasting climates. Chapter 6 presents results of the estimation of predictive uncertainty and parameter sensitivity through the application of CREW to two catchments in Australia, namely Susannah Brook and Howard Springs, by using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Finally, Chapter 7 presents recommendations for future work for the further advancement of the REW approach. Through these exercises this PhD thesis has successfully transformed the REW-scale coupled balance equations derived by Reggiani et al.

Consciousness is a function more marked in highly developed organisms, which are less subject in consequence to the influence of their material environment. Such a conception of education omits a mechanist interpretation of the cosmos. It proceeds from the assumption that the universe has purpose, and that this purpose may be progressively revealed as life achieves more integrated organisation. In the affairs of men the specialised function is undertaken by certain thinkers who develop the capacity to give direction to human activities. These men are educators. A general theory of education will draw its material from a study of the developmental trends of a whole civilization; that of Western Europe, being the most influential in the affairs of the modern world, is considered as providing the best illustrative material for the formulation of such theory. While major emphasis is placed upon the innovating effect of education, it should be remembered that much of its effort is directed to the preservation of the organism. But the most effective conservative activities must be those that cater for, and permit of growth and development. ... The eighteenth and nineteenth century period of consolidation permitted a relaxation of personal guidance and control. The crises of the twentieth century necessitated the resumption of direction in the economic and political affairs of men. Western European Civilization is passing from the era of the entrepreneur to that of the managers and specialists. Specialists need the guidance and direction of an integrated body of moral and political theory that will relate their efforts to the needs of a world community. The function of the modern educator is to evolve and expound theories that render human activity intelligible. The educator will be informed through his study of the inter-relationship between epistemology, science, economics and politics. He must aspire to the comprehension of the wholeness of things. If 'mind' is to be the controlling factor in an indeterminate universe, and if 'mind' emerges out of the integration and organisation of matter, then the purpose of human activity is to achieve harmony and integration in the material universe. Life aims at the emergence of 'mind' through the self-directed organisation of matter. The function of the educator, corresponding in human affairs to that of 'mind' in the material universe, is of paramount importance in the modern world which interprets cosmic events in accordance with a principle of indeterminacy.</field><field name="date">1954</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educators -- History</field><field name="subject">Civilization</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local adaptation and genetic variation in south-western Australian forest trees : implications for restoration</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Eleanor K</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Spatial structuring of genetic variation is commonly observed in plant species due to limited dispersal and local adaptation. Intraspecific genetic variation has significant implications for ecological restoration because the source of seed or plants influences patterns of gene flow, and may affect performance if there is adaptive divergence among source populations. This study assessed quantitative trait variation, local adaptation and molecular variation within three common, widespread, long-lived forest tree species from south-western Australia to understand the distribution of intraspecific genetic variation and predict the consequences of seed transfer for restoration. The geographic distribution of quantitative trait variation of jarrah Eucalyptus marginata was assessed through measurement of 15-year-old trees grown in a provenance trial. Survival of trees from the northern jarrah forest was significantly higher than that of trees from southern jarrah forest provenances, where mean annual rainfall is much higher, but stem diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of southern jarrah forest trees was greater, implying faster growth. D.b.h. of trees from within the northern jarrah forest also exhibited a positive relationship with mean annual rainfall, with maximum d.b.h. observed in trees from provenances in the high rainfall zone. These patterns may reflect selection for faster growth under high rainfall conditions or environmentally-induced parental effects. The percentage of trees bearing buds and flowers varied among latitudinal divisions. ...  Neither genetic variation within nor among populations of any species could explain variation of emergence and establishment in reciprocal transplant trials. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest structuring of genetic variation in these species at a broad, rather than a very local, scale. This is expected for widespread, long-lived species, where extensive gene flow and temporal variation are likely to favour high within, relative to among, population genetic variation. However, there is evidence that the source of seed may have a significant influence on the success of restoration of these species, whether as a result of genetic variation among populations or due to other factors affecting seed quality. These results highlight the importance of integrating studies of molecular and adaptive trait variation when seeking to understand the causes and consequences of genetic variation within plant species and contribute to the development of seed sourcing practices for improved restoration success.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest reproduction -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Restoration ecology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Forest genetics -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Forest management -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Trees -- Western Australia -- South-West -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Local adaptation</field><field name="subject">Forest trees</field><field name="subject">Population genetics</field><field name="subject">Restoration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecophysiological principles governing the zonation of puccinellia (Puccinellia ciliata) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) on saline waterlogged land in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Sommer</field><field name="description">Puccinellia (puccinellia ciliata) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) often show ecological zonation in saline landscapes, with puccinellia occurring in less elevated more saline/waterlogged locations, and tall wheatgrass occurring in more elevated less saline/waterlogged locations. The aims of this study were to: (a) characterize the observed ecological zonation at a field site, (b) quantify the effects of variables likely to explain growth differences of the two plants in glasshouse experiments, and (c) identify and compare anatomical and physiological mechanisms that explain these zonation patterns. At an experiment in the field near Kojonup (0522824E, 6244579N), puccinellia was found to colonise the lower more severely salinised and waterlogged zones of the landscape, with tall wheatgrass occupying the higher less affected zones. These differences in zonation were clearly associated with variance in soil salinity and water-table depth. Glasshouse experiments in soil revealed that low pH values, low calcium concentrations and variation in salinity alone did not explain the ecological zonation observed in the field. However, there was a substantial difference in the responses of the two plant species to waterlogging in combination with salinity. Puccinellia grew better under saline waterlogged conditions than tall wheatgrass, which was associated with better regulation of Na+ and K+ under saline/waterlogged conditions than in tall wheatgrass. Under non-saline conditions, waterlogging (hypoxia) decreased shoot weights in puccinellia by 15% and in tall wheatgrass by 20%. Similar growth results were obtained in nutrient solution culture, where waterlogging was simulated by lowering the oxygen in solutions through bubbling with N2 gas. Under saline hypoxic conditions, puccinellia, compared to tall wheatgrass, showed increased growth and maintenance of selectivity of K+ over Na+ across adventitious roots. Solution experiments revealed adaptive traits responsible for conveying better growth and ion maintenance present in puccinellia, but not tall wheatgrass, such as inducement of a barrier to radial oxygen loss in the basal regions of adventitious roots (not previously reported in the literature for puccinellia), formation of root aerenchyma and packing of cortical cells and suberin deposition in hypodermal and endodermal root cell layers. These results should assist in targeting pasture species, and predicting their growth response, in saline and waterlogged landscapes. Further work on examining the genetic material of puccinellia is warranted in order to identify genes that could be transferred into crop plants to convey salt and waterlogging tolerance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Puccinellia -- Ecophysiology</field><field name="subject">Wheatgrass (Wheat) -- Ecophysiology</field><field name="subject">Soils, Salts in -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Water table -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Plant ecophysiology -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Soil salinity</field><field name="subject">Ion relations</field><field name="subject">Radial oxygen loss</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A numerical study of the mesoscale eddy dynamics of the Leeuwin Current system</field><field name="creator">Meuleners, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The study of eastern ocean boundary currents has been principally restricted to the Pacific and Atlantic ocean regions. The traditional view of the circulation near eastern ocean boundaries is that upwelling-favourable winds force surface waters offshore, leading to upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich subsurface water at the coast, the formation and offshore advection of a coastal front, and the generation of alongshore currents, generally having an equatorward surface flow and a poleward undercurrent. The eastern ocean boundary system of the southern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia, is unique compared with these regions because a warm, poleward surface flow, known as the Leeuwin Current, dominates the dynamics over the continental shelf. Satellite imagery has shown the Leeuwin Current consists of a complex system of meanders, jet-like streams, and eddies, and has a seasonal and interannual variability. The oceanic circulation of the region between Carnarvon (latitude 25&#176;S) and Jurien Bay (latitude 31&#176;S) was examined using observational and remotely sensed data in conjunction with a detailed numerical modelling study. The model was validated using in situ ADCP and CTD data, and the horizontal eddy viscosity parameterization was tested against field observations. ... The resulting offshore meander grew laterally, shallowed, and closed to form an anticlockwise eddy to the original clockwise eddy&#8217;s south, forming a characteristic LC eddy pair (dipole). The model demonstrated the LC and Leeuwin Undercurrent (LUC) coupling played an important role in the onset of eddies at both sites. When an energy diagnostic scheme was used, the dominant instability process linked to the anticlockwise eddy&#8217;s development at site 1 was a mixed mode barotropic and baroclinic instability. The baroclinic instability&#8217;s source was the available potential energy stored within the mean lateral density gradient. The LC&#8217;s meandering southerly flow interacting with the LUC&#8217;s northerly subsurface flow generated the horizontal shear that sourced the barotropic instability. The dominant instability process at site 2 was baroclinic in origin. Possible links between the eddy field dynamics and the shelfslope region&#8217;s alongshore topographic variability were considered. The results of a suite of five model runs, differing only in the specification of bottom topography, were contrasted to investigate the effects. Except for the expected alongshore variability, delay in the onset of instabilities, varying growth rates, and some differences in the dominant wavebands&#8217; mesoscale patterns, the overall impression was the response was similar.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean waves -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Winds -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents -- Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">Meteorological satellites</field><field name="subject">Eddies</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin current</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin undercurrent</field><field name="subject">Eddies</field><field name="subject">Meoscale dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consuming femininity : nation-state, gender and Singaporean Chinese women</field><field name="creator">Chew, Wendy Poh Yoke</field><field name="description">My research seeks to understand ways in which English-educated Chinese women in cosmopolitan Singapore bolstered their identity while living under the influences of Confucian values, patriarchal nation-building and racial concerns. My thesis examines women who have themselves been lost in translation when they were co-opted into the creation of a viable state after 1965. Often women are treated as adjuncts in the patriarchal state, particularly since issues of gender are not treated with the equality they deserve in the neo-Confucian discourse. This thesis takes an unconventional approach to how women have been viewed by utilizing primary sources including Her World and Female magazines from the 1960s and 1990s, and subsequent material from the blogosphere. I analyze images of women in these magazines to gain an understanding of how notions of gender and communitarianism/race intersect. By looking at government-sponsored advertising, my work also investigates the kind of messages the state was sending out to these women readers. My examination of government-sponsored advertisements, in tandem with the existing mainstream consumer advertising directed at women provides therefore a unique historical perspective in understanding the kinds of pressures Singaporean women have faced. Blogging itself is used as a counterpoint to show how new spaces have opened up for those who have felt constricted in certain ways by the authorities, women included. It would be fair to say that women?s magazines and blogging have served as ways for women to bolster their self worth, despite the counter-argument that some highly idealized and unhealthy images of women are purveyed.

I then integrate this analysis with the perceptions of a cohort of Jordanian Muslims about their mental health problems and treatment. Two important theoretical frameworks underpin this research, namely the post-colonial theorizing of scholars such as Edward Said, Franz Fanon, and Homi Bhabha, and the Explanatory Model of Arthur Kleinman. Research on the assessment and treatment of mental illness in Islamic and Arabic culture is limited. What literature does exist, suggests that in spite of the increase in research on cultural issues related to mental health, there is a strong need for further research to explore the nexus between culture, religion and mental health diagnosis and treatment in non-western cultures, in order to advance cultural sensitivity amongst mental health professions. This research fills this lacuna in mental health scholarship about the mental health awareness and experiences of Muslims. All of the interviews were conducted at the Mental Health Centre in Jordan, where twenty male and female participants were selected and then interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. The textual analysis commenced while I was in Jordan but was completed on my return to Australia. The data were analysed using both NVivo software and manual coding. The results of this analysis are organized around the two main themes that emerged  those of `Causation &#8217; and `Help-seeking &#8217;. Sub-themes to each of these primary themes provide a comprehensive picture of the understanding and behavior of Muslim people accessing assistance from a mental health clinic, and contribute to understanding of mental health issues related to Islam and to Muslims living in Jordan. The research identifies that religion and religious belief are absolutely central to the way that this cohort of Muslim participants interpret the cause and development of their mental health problems and, further, it posits that this is due in part to the explanations of causation and coping contained in primary Muslim texts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muslims -- Mental health -- Jordan</field><field name="subject">Mental health -- Religious aspects -- Islam</field><field name="subject">Islam -- Psychology</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the rainfall controls on pesticide transport via fast flow pathways</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Gavan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Pesticides are often transported to streams and/or groundwater as a result of the occurrence of rainfall events which trigger surface runoff or rapid preferential flow through the unsaturated zone. Much of the theory of solute transport has been derived assuming steady state or slowly varying upper boundary conditions and continuous, averaged process descriptions. However, a review of pesticide dynamics reveals that pesticides are episodically transported, predominantly through discrete flow pathways and this transport is often initiated as a near surface process, driven by naturally variable and intermittent rainfall intensities. The objective of the thesis is to better understand how the structure of natural variability of rainfall intensities impacts upon pesticide transport by these fast flow processes. We first conducted an analysis of a lysimeter leaching experiment that was aimed at identifying the rainfall controls on herbicide transport. Multivariate analyses revealed that average water balance behaviour at low temporal resolution controlled water and bromide transport while extreme rainfall events and rainfall event frequency controlled herbicide transport. A minimalist event based modelling approach was able to simulate the observed herbicide transport without or with only minor calibration. ...  Finally we conduct a climate based regional risk assessment of pesticide leaching for the Wheatbelt region of the south-west of Western Australia. This is done for a suite of pesticides on a single soil to evaluate the impact of rainfall variability alone. Moderately sorbing, slowly degrading solutes have a greater regional potential for rapid leaching than both strongly and weakly sorbing solutes. High leaching potentials are found along the western and southern coast and in the far-east, with a band of low leaching potential through the central Wheatbelt. This is despite higher annual rainfall in the central areas compared to the east, and it is found that this occurs because of a change in the dominant fast flow triggers from frequent low intensity rainfall on the coasts to high intensity infrequent storms in the east. The coefficient of variation of annual leaching loads is similarly distributed. Spatial patterns of leaching potential depend upon chemical properties and application time. Peak loads of chemicals to fast flow pathways are found to converge to mid-winter, indicating periods of high loads of multiple pesticides may be an unavoidable consequence of the seasonality of storm properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Runoff</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Pollution</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pollution</field><field name="subject">Pesticides -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pesticide content</field><field name="subject">Pesticide transport</field><field name="subject">Thresholds</field><field name="subject">Preferential flow</field><field name="subject">Climate</field><field name="subject">Rainfall</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecophysiology of Australian cocooning and non-cocooning, burrowing, desert frogs</field><field name="creator">McMaster, Kellie Anne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis explores the ecophysiology of cocooning and non-cocooning Australian burrowing desert frogs in order to specify the details of these two alternative survival strategies. Many details of these life-history strategies have not previously been determined for Australian frogs. In this study the detailed method of function and formation of the cocoon itself was investigated for the first time, as were the moulting cycles, which drive cocoon formation. Cocooning species had consistently shorter inter-moult-periods than non-cocooning species, which is presumably adaptive, allowing production of cocoon layers at a faster rate. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cocoon formation in Cyclorana platycephala to be a plastic, rather than static adaptation. The initial stages of cocoon formation appear to be the most critical. Cocoon layer formation is fastest in the first month and the initial layers produced are thicker than subsequent layers. Also, only in this initial stage does layer thickness appear to be influenced by soil moisture. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the lips, eyelids and cloaca of cocooned frogs to be sealed by continuous layers of cocoon. However, it remains unclear precisely how the continuous junctions between cells from discreet sources, such as the upper and lower lip, are formed. Measurements of evaporative water loss and resistance over various relative humidity gradients suggested that water content within the cocoon structure is very low unless the external RH is &gt; 93%. Therefore, anuran cocoon is confirmed to function as a specialised and highly effective barrier to water diffusion in arid-zone frogs. ... Within a dune swale, N. aquilonius burrows were an average depth of 1.13 m in loamy sand (clay = 6%, silt = 7%). Neobatrachus aquilonius excavated from the claypan had well formed cocoons, while those found in the dune swale had only one or two thin layers, indicating cocoon formation had only just commenced, although the last rainfall had been over six months prior. This suggests that N. aquilonius is able to switch between the cocooning and non-cocooning strategy in different soil types and different conditions.  In summary, cocoon formation was found not to be an entirely passive accumulation of layers. Cocoon formation involved specialisation in the rate and thickness of epithelial layer production and the sealing of layers over lips, eyes and cloaca. Moreover, the cocoon was confirmed to operate effectively as a diffusion barrier at all except the highest external relative humidity. Like cocoon-forming species, Notaden nichollsi was found to metabolically depress to survive for longer periods underground.

The TNF gene lies in the class III region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), approximately 250 Kbp centromeric of the HLA-B locus and 850 Kbp telomeric of HLA-DR. Due to the genomic location and biological relevance of TNF, it is thought that genetic heterogeneity at this locus may be associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. A G-to-A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -308 (relative to the transcriptional start site) in the TNF promoter has been well described. The less common -308A variant has been shown to be linked with the HLA-A1, B8, DR3 haplotype which in turn has been associated to a high TNF producing phenotype. Determining whether the -308 polymorphism contributes to elevated levels of expression has therefore been a priority for many research groups. Some investigators have shown differences in transcription between the -308G and -308A alleles while others could not. These contradicting results have led to conflicting views regarding the functional relevance of the -308 SNP. In this study, statistical analysis of 18 independent transient transfections of -308 biallelic TNF reporter constructs have provided evidence for a functional consequence of the polymorphism. ... In addition, chromatin accessibility of this region was maximal at greater levels of transcription suggesting a role for both chromatin structure and YY1 binding in -308G regulation. Surprisingly, chromatin structure did not seem to play a role in -308A regulation nor was there any significant binding of YY1, suggesting the -308 region does not affect transcriptional control of TNF. Taken as a whole, the G-to-A SNP relieves YY1 binding and demonstrates an allele-specific regulatory mechanism controlling expression. A growing list of promoter polymorphisms exists in the human genome having associations with certain diseases. Determining the functional consequence of these SNPs has proven difficult and utilized mainly in vitro approaches. In this thesis, a unique approach to investigating the functionality of promoter polymoprhisms has been developed, utilizing in vivo techniques which test their effects in a more natural system. It is hoped that the identification of the allele-specific YY1-mediated control of the -308 region of the TNF promoter may provide insight into overexpression as a consequence of the polymorphism and its role in the genetic susceptibility to MHC-associated autoimmune disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="subject">Genetic polymorphisms</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Transcription factors</field><field name="subject">TNF</field><field name="subject">SNP functionality</field><field name="subject">-308 SNP</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and validation of an instrument to identify risk of self-harm in children</field><field name="creator">Angelkovska, Agni</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]The overall aim of the research reported in this thesis was to develop and validate an instrument that would identify children among the general population at risk of self-harm. To achieve this, four separate yet interrelated studies were conducted. Study One, which sought to explore the risk factors of self-harm in children comprised a series of focus interviews with three paediatricians and 24 mothers of children who had self-harmed or who had verbalized self-harm ideation. The findings revealed that prior to the onset of self-harming or self-harm ideation these children reportedly manifested other problem behaviours that prompted their mothers to seek specialist advice from a paediatrician. The majority of these problem behaviours were characteristic of externalizing problems, either in the form of conduct problems, aggressive behaviours or impulsiveness. Conversely, some problem behaviours were characteristic of internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression. These findings provided valuable information which in addition to the current literature created the conceptual framework for the subsequent studies. Study Two incorporated the information obtained from Study One, along with that obtained from a review of existing instruments that measure self-harm or suicide, to develop a new instrument specifically designed to assess the risk of children in the general population developing self-harming behaviours. Initially, 159 items were generated and using the extant knowledge regarding the risk factors of self-harm as a guide, the items were categorized into risk factors of anxiety, depression, low self- ii worth, social difficulty, social withdrawal, helplessness, hopelessness, atypical cognition, emotional lability, impulsivity, self-harming ideation and self-harm. ... Study Four comprised four interrelated investigations, the purposes of which were to (i) examine the prevalence rates of self-harming ideation and self-harm among young school aged children in the general population; (ii) investigate differences of risk of self-harm between the referred group and community comparison group; (iii) examine the relationship between impulsivity and risk of self-harm in these children and, (iv) examine the relationship between executive function and risk of self-harm among these children. The results from these investigations revealed that approximately 3.5% of children aged between 6 to12 years in the general population manifest self-harming ideations and approximately 2.5% actually self-harm. No significant age or gender differences were found. Children that presented with a higher level of risk of self-harm also presented with a complex array of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviours. Furthermore, children who displayed significantly higher levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptomatology scored higher on the SHRAC instrument, as did the children who had higher levels of executive functioning impairment.

The study adopts a disaggregated form of the Feltham and Ohlson (1995) valuation model and associated linear information models (LIMs) to allow goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to be separately examined using unbalanced panel regression analysis. The results for the Australian sample suggest that the adaptation of the Feltham and Ohlson (1995) valuation model used in this study is particularly useful in examining Australian equity securities. For example, the pooled sample analysis results in an adjusted R2 of 71%, which is consistent with similar US studies by Ahmed, Morton and Schaefer (2000) and Amir, Kirscenheiter and Willard (1997). Further, the results from the disaggregated Feltham and Ohlson (1995) valuation models suggest that the information presented with respect to intangible assets (both goodwill and identifiable intangible assets) under Australian GAAP is value relevant. However, the results from the valuation models also suggest that (for the average Australian company) the market believes goodwill is reported conservatively and identifiable intangible assets aggressively. ...  As noted earlier, the increasing importance of intangible assets in the `new-economy&#8217; suggests that (wherever possible having regard to the measurement difficulties) all intangible assets should be recognised in financial statements to maximise the value relevance of those statements. It should be noted, however, that there was some evidence to suggest that certain Australian companies (that is, those not consistently reporting positive abnormal operating earnings) might be reporting goodwill and/or identifiable intangible assets aggressively and this is an area that standard setters might need to carefully consider in future. I trust that the findings presented in this study will prove helpful to both researchers and those involved with formulating international accounting standards in this particularly difficult area of intangible assets. I also hope the results will help to allay any fears regulators (and others) might have that providing managers with accounting discretion will (necessarily) lead to biased reporting practices; based on the findings of this study for the majority of Australian and US companies, any such fears appear unwarranted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intangible property -- Australia -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Intangible property -- United States -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Intangible property -- Valuation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Intangible property -- Valuation -- United States</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the function of meningococcal genes : NMB0711, NMB0768, NMB1048, NMB1525, NMB1898, NMB1948 and NMB1966</field><field name="creator">Chow, Noel Yuet Sung</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the construction and evaluation of six knockout mutants in Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58.

The mutant knockout of NMB1966 showed (1) impaired growth beyond the mid-logarithmic phase in shaking broth culture but normal growth on solid medium, (2) reduced virulence in a mouse model of infection, (3) impairment in its capacity to invade (although not adhere to) cultured human bronchial epithelial cells, and (4) more rapid killing in ex vivo human blood. NMB1966 is predicted to encode the ATP-binding subunit of an ABC transporter and, after experiments for this thesis had been completed, it was demonstrated, by others, that this ABC transporter is responsible for uptake of L-Glutamate at low sodium concentrations. It is likely that defective uptake of L-Glutamate explains the observed defect in shaking broth culture and intracellular survival, both of which are associated with low ambient concentrations of sodium. However, it is not certain if this mechanism explains the observed defect in survival in human blood and in the infant mouse model which test predominantly extracellular survival and represent environments with high sodium concentrations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meningitis -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Meningococcal disease</field><field name="subject">Neisseria Meningifidis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Securitising population growth in Muslim states and societies : a case study of Iran and Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Riddell, Katrina</field><field name="description">To securitise an issue is to elevate it above politics to security status. At the global level, population growth has been securitised by a number of change agents. They have arrived at an understanding of population growth as existentially threatening and of population control as the best solution. This transformative process took place during the twentieth century and was enabled largely by the United Nations. However, in some Muslim states and societies where population growth is potentially threatening and securitisation of it is necessary, Islamic factors and agents might prevent this from happening. Events and experiences suggest that population control is antithetical to Islam. Muslim states and societies tend to experience higher growth and fertility rates than their non-Muslim counterparts. Furthermore, some Islamic agents have vocally opposed global and national population control objectives. Because of these two occurrences, Islam is assumed to be pro-natalist and anti-population control. It is also assumed that Islam is causal to high fertility and growth and the failure of control efforts. But is this necessarily true? Is population control antithetical to Islam? Moreover, will Islam and its agents prevent the securitisation of population growth by Muslim states and societies? These questions are explored through the case studies of Iran and Pakistan.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Population policy -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Pakistan -- Population</field><field name="subject">Iran -- Population</field><field name="subject">Islam and politics -- Iran</field><field name="subject">Islam and politics -- Pakistan</field><field name="subject">Securitisation</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of resonant-cavity-enhanced mercury cadmium telluride infrared detectors</field><field name="creator">Wehner, Justin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Infrared (IR) detectors have many applications, from homeland security and defense, to medical imaging, to environmental monitoring, to astronomy, etc. Increasingly, the wave- length dependence of the IR radiation is becoming important in many applications, not just the total intensity of infrared radiation. There are many types of infrared detectors that can be broadly categorized as either photon detectors (narrow band-gap materials or quantum structures that provide the necessary energy transitions to generate free car- riers) or thermal detectors. Photon detectors generally provide the highest sensitivity, however the small transition energy of the detector also means cooling is required to limit the noise due to intrinsic thermal generation. This thesis is concerned with the tech- nique of resonant-cavity-enhancement of detectors, which is the process of placing the detector within an optically resonant cavity. Resonant-cavity-enhanced detectors have many favourable properties including a reduced detector volume, which allows improved operating temperature, or an improved signal to noise ratio (or some balance between the two), along with a narrow spectral bandwidth. ... Responsivity of another sample annealed for 20 hours at 250C in a Hg atmosphere (ex-situ) also shows resonant performance, but indicates significant shunting due the mirror layers. There is good agreement with model data, and the peak responsivity due to the absorber layer is 9.5&#215;103 V/W for a 100 'm &#215;100 'm photoconductor at 80K. An effective lifetime of 50.4 ns is extracted for this responsivity measurement. The responsivity was measured as a function of varying field, and sweepout was observed for bias fields greater than 50 V/cm. The effective lifetime extracted from this measurement was 224 ns, but is an over estimate. Photodiodes were also fabricated by annealing p-type Hg(1x)Cd(x)Te for 10 hours at 250C in vacuum and type converting in a CH4/H2 reactive ion etch plasma process to form the n-p junction. There is some degradation to the mirror structure due to the anneal in vacuum, but a clear region of high reflection is observed. Measurements of current-voltage characteristics at various temperatures show diode-like characteristics with a peak R0 of 10 G  measured at 80K (corresponding to an R0A of approximately 104  cm2.

Recognition of the importance of the genetically determined muscular dystrophies as slowly crippling conditions which can be fatal in early adult life, of the inflammatory myopathies which can complicate various systemic disorders and of the not uncommon involvement of the skeletal muscles in metabolic and endocrine disorders has stimulated increasing interest in myopathology both on the part of the clinician and the pathologist. ... Although advances in the fields of biochemistry, cytochemistry and electronmicroscopy over the past two decades have led to the recognition of several new myopathies and thrown considerable light on the biochemical and fine structural changes in several of the others, our knowledge of the aetiology and pathogenesis of these conditions remains far from complete. Despite much research we still do not know the nature of the basic abnormality in the muscular dystrophies or in polymyositis nor the mechanisms whereby this leads to the observed lesions in the diseases.

This knowledge was applied to develop a suitable formulated diet to be fed in combination with Artemia or used as a supplement to reduce production costs. The major impediment to closure of the life cycle of spiny lobsters has been an inadequate dietary regime, stemming from a lack of information on their feeding biology and ingestive and digestive capabilities. Of all spiny lobster species, P. ornatus is the best candidate for aquaculture in Australia having the shortest larval development phase (46 months) and fast growth rate, attaining 1 kg within 2 years of hatch. Currently, Artemia and fresh feeds such as mussel are used routinely as hatchery feeds. However, the development of a formulated diet that is palatable and delivers the correct balance of nutrients is seen as a highly attractive and cost effective alternative. An appropriate formulated diet for aquaculture of phyllosomata of spiny lobsters can be developed more effectively when the ingestive and digestive morphology, physiology and feeding behaviour are fully understood. ... Partial replacement trials revealed that P. ornatus phyllosoma are stimulated to feed by visual cues. Furthermore, 75% of the entire Artemia ration can be replaced with a formulated diet without having any adverse effects on survival and growth of early-stage phyllosomata. Weaning P. ornatus phyllosomata onto 100% formulated diet during stages II-III resulted in reduced survival but demonstrated that diets containing 44-50% crude protein with a diverse range of marine protein sources provides optimum survival and growth. This thesis has identified both physical and nutritional components that will contribute to the successful development of formulated diets for aquaculture of this species. Ultimately, although formulated diets are ingested and provide more than adequate survival when fed in combination with Artemia during early ontogeny, greater success and the possibility of totally replacing Artemia may occur after day 32 (stage IV) due to an increased efficiency to capture and manipulate larger sized particles externally and a greater capacity to triturate prey and sort and filter particles internally. Furthermore, a general increase in specific activity of digestive enzymes at stage IV suggests the possibility of a greater capacity to digest and assimilate nutrients.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spiny lobsters -- Larvae -- Food</field><field name="subject">Spiny lobsters -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Spiny lobsters -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Panulirus</field><field name="subject">Spiny lobster culture</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Descending control of responses in the auditory midbrain</field><field name="creator">Seluakumaran, Kumar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The mammalian inner ear is innervated by the efferent olivocochlear system which is divided into medial and lateral systems. In anaesthetised animals, medial olivocochlear (MOC) axons can be electrically stimulated at the floor of the IVth ventricle. MOC stimulation suppresses the spontaneous activity and sound-evoked responses of primary afferents by its actions on outer hair cells. Effects of MOC stimulation have been also reported on responses of neurons in the cochlear nucleus, the first central auditory center receiving cochlear input. However, very little is known about the net results of MOC effects in higher order neurons. This issue was investigated by electrically stimulating MOC axons at the IVth ventricle and recording extracellular single unit activities in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) of anaesthetised guinea pigs. For the first part of the study, anatomical and neurophysiological studies were carried out to establish that the focal midline MOC stimulation can selectively stimulate MOC axons without any current spread to adjacent ascending fibers. The MOC stimulation and CNIC recordings were then carried out in a series of experiments that included normal hearing animals, animals treated acutely with gentamicin (in which the acetylcholine-mediated peripheral suppression of the olivocochlear efferents is selectively eliminated) and partially deafened animals. ... However, in other CNIC neurons, effects could not be so explained, showing either additional suppression or even marked excitatory effects. (4) MOC stimulation also suppressed the spontaneous activity of CNIC neurons in normal hearing animals. When similar efferent stimulation was carried out in partially deafened animals, the abnormally high spontaneous activity of some CNIC neurons in the deafened frequency regions was also transiently suppressed by MOC shocks. The results from this study clearly demonstrate that the MOC system can modulate the responses of midbrain neurons in a more complex manner compared to the effects seen in the periphery. The more complex effects seen for responses to tones in quiet and in noisy background are likely to result from a complex interplay between altered afferent input in the cochlea and central circuitry. In addition, the ability of MOC efferents in suppressing the normal and abnormal spontaneous activity in the midbrain also could have implications for the role of the descending system in the pathophysiology and treatment of tinnitus.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustic nerve</field><field name="subject">Inferior colliculus</field><field name="subject">Auditory pathways</field><field name="subject">Cochlear nucleus</field><field name="subject">Guinea pigs -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Electrocochleography</field><field name="subject">Olivocochlear system</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Archaeology of the iron barque Sepia : an investigation of cargo assemblages</field><field name="creator">Souter, Corioli</field><field name="description">The Western Australian Museum houses a large collection of artefacts from late nineteenth century iron sailing vessels, wrecked en route from Britain. The bulk of this collection comprises cargo objects, destined for sale in the Swan River colony. The protection afforded artefacts, due to the integrity of these shipwrecks, presents new research opportunites for identifying particular classes of commodities which were considered either necessary or desirable for colonial consumers. This thesis examines the notion of material consumption as reflected in shipwreck assemblages in Western Australia for the later nineteenth century, prior to Federation. The research is concerned with the notion of cultural continuity from Britain through specific product selection, as demonstrated by the archaeological assemblages of iron barques importing general merchandise into the colony. Focusing on the Sepia (1898), the objectives include an appraisal of shipwreck cargo artefacts and their applicability to questions relating to consumer behaviour. While the primary objective of this study is on the identification of cargo assemblages, it presents an opportunity to study taphonomic processes and provide a method of relating the vessel to its cargo contents in order to answer broader questions about shipping practices, with a particular focus on stowage. This research also critiques shipwreck collections comprised of selectively recovered, unprovenanced artefacts and suggests appropriate methods for using such material.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sepia (Ship)</field><field name="subject">Underwater archaeology -- Western Australia -- Garden Island</field><field name="subject">Shipwrecks -- Western Australia -- Garden Island</field><field name="subject">Salvage -- Western Australia -- Garden Island</field><field name="subject">Garden Island (W.A.) -- Antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image-based modelling of pattern dynamics in a semiarid grassland of the Pilbara, Australia</field><field name="creator">Sadler, Rohan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Ecologists are increasingly interested in quantifying local interacting processes and their impacts on spatial vegetation patterns. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, theoretical models (often spatially explicit) of dynamical system behaviour have been used to provide insight into changes in vegetation patterning and productivity triggered by ecological events, such as fire and episodic rainfall. The incorporation of aerial imagery of vegetation patterning into current theoretical model remains a challenge, as few theoretical models may be inferred directly from ecological data, let alone imagery. However, if conclusions drawn from theoretical models were well supported by image data then these models could serve as a basis for improved prediction of complex ecosystem behaviour. The objective of this thesis is therefore to innovate methods for inferring theoretical models of vegetation dynamics from imagery. ... These results demonstrate how an ad hoc inference procedure returns biologically meaningful parameter estimates for a germ-grain model of T. triandra vegetation patterning, with VLSA photography as data. Various aspects of the modelling and inference procedures are discussed in the concluding chapter, including possible future extensions and alternative applications for germ-grain models. I conclude that the state-and-transition model provides an effective exploration of an ecosystem?s dynamics, and complements spatially explicit models designed to test specific ecological mechanisms. Significantly, both types of models may now be inferred from image data through the methodologies I have developed, and can provide an empirical basis to theoretical models of complex vegetation dynamics used in understanding and managing arid (and other) ecological systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vegetation dynamics -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Vegetation dynamics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Vegentation dynamics -- Western Australia -- Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Kangaroo grass</field><field name="subject">Grasslands -- Western Australia -- Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Computational statistics</field><field name="subject">Spatially explicit models</field><field name="subject">Semi-arid grasslands</field><field name="subject">Very large scale aerial imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Suppression of transient gain excursions in an erbium-doped fibre amplifier</field><field name="creator">Males, Mladen</field><field name="description">This thesis reports original work on suppression of transient gain excursions in an erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA). The work presented in this thesis is a detailed investigation of four closed-loop systems that control the EDFA gain dynamically. The performance of the four closed-loop systems is evaluated by analytical work, supplemented by computer simulations and insystem measurements performed on a hardware EDFA. In addition, a stability analysis of the four closed-loop systems is presented. In the stability analysis presented in this thesis, nonlinear nature of the four closed-loop systems is taken into consideration. In the stability analysis, in addition to proving that the four closed-loop systems considered are stable, it is proven that for any practical values of the EDFA gain at the initial time of observation, the EDFA gain is restored to the desired value in steady state. These outcomes of the stability analysis are supported by simulation results and experimental results. Errors in system modelling, change in the operating point of the nonlinear closed-loop system, and measurement noise are important aspects of practical implementations of systems that control the EDFA gain dynamically. A detailed analysis of the effects these practical aspects have on the performance of the four closed-loop systems considered is presented. The analysis is validated using computer simulations and experimental measurements. In most of the work reported in the literature on controlling the EDFA gain, controllers that include feedforward and/or feedback components are employed. In the traditional approaches to combining the feedforward and the feedback components, large transient excursions of the EDFA gain can still occur due to errors in the control provided by the feedforward component. In this thesis, a novel approach to combining the feedforward and the feedback components of the controller is presented. Based on the analytical work, the computer simulations and the experimental work presented in this thesis, the novel approach provides a significant reduction in the excursions of the EDFA gain in the transient period.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical amplifiers</field><field name="subject">Optical fibers</field><field name="subject">Optical fiber communication</field><field name="subject">Optical fiber communication -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Optical communications -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High performance vibration isolation techniques for the AIGO gravitational wave detector</field><field name="creator">Chin, Eu-Jeen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are being built around the world with continually improving measurement sensitivities. Noise levels from sources that are intrinsic to these detectors must be reduced to a level below the gravita- tional wave signal. Seismic noise in the low frequency range, which is within the gravitational wave detection bandwidth, is a concern for earth-based detectors. This thesis presents research and development of a high performance vibration isolation system that is designed to attenuate seismic noise. The final design will be used as part of a fully working interferometer at the Australian International Gravitational Observatory (AIGO). Pendulums and springs are conventionally used for the horizontal and vertical vibration isolation components respectively. A complete system comprises of a cascade of these components, each stage dramatically improving the level of isola- tion. The residual motion at the test mass level is thus reduced but is dominated by the normal mode resonances of the chain. A simple and effective method to reduce residual motion further is to add ultra-low frequency pre-isolation stages which suspend the chain. The Roberts Linkage is a relatively new and simple geometrical structure that is implemented in the pre-isolation stages. Here we present experimental results of improving isolation based on mathematical mod- elling. The attenuation of seismic noise in the vertical direction is almost as important as that in the horizontal direction, due to cross-coupling between the two planes. To help improve the vertical performance a lightweight Euler spring that stores no static energy was implemented into the AIGO suspension system. ... Theoretical and experimental results are presented and discussed. Currently the AIGO laboratory consists of two 80 m length arms. They are aligned along the east and south directions. One of AIGO's top priorities is the installation of two complete vibration isolators in the east arm to form a Fabry-Perot cavity. Assembling two suspension systems will enable more accurate performance measurements of the tuned isolators. This would significantly reduce the measurement noise floor as well as eliminate the seismic noise spectrum due to referencing with the ground motion. The processes involved in preparing such a task is presented, including clean room preparation, tuning of each isolator stage, and local control schematics and methods. The status of the AIGO site is also presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interferometers</field><field name="subject">Seismic waves -- Damping</field><field name="subject">Vibration -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Gravity stations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Astronomical observatories -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves</field><field name="subject">AIGO</field><field name="subject">Vibration isolation</field><field name="subject">Seismic noise</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular characterisation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia : gene expression profiles to elucidate leukaemogenesis</field><field name="creator">Boag, Joanne</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common form of cancer that affects children and the leading cause of child cancer-related death. There have been dramatic improvements in the 5-year event free survival (EFS) for childhood ALL in recent years, with EFS reaching 75-90% for some forms of the disease. Despite this success, treatment for the disease is aggressive with numerous long and short-term side effects. Many cases of ALL are characterised by chromosomal defects including translocations, variations in chromosome number and the deletion of the tumour suppressor genes. Although these gross chromosomal changes have been extensively studied in childhood ALL, the cascade of altered gene expression that results from these changes has not. Further improvements in survival and the quality of life of survivors relies on a better understanding of the underlying biology of ALL. The primary aim of this study was to determine the gene expression profile of pre-B ALL specimens and normal, or non-malignant, control cells using microarrays in order to further examine the underlying biology of childhood ALL. ... Analysis of the ALL profile with two normal haematopoietic populations demonstrated that ALL specimens have a profile similar to that of CD34+ cells. Specifically, specimens of the MLL subtype had a profile that uniformly resembled that of CD34+ cells. Other subgroups contained specimens with profiles that ranged in similarity to that of CD34+ cells, however, the gene expression profile of all ALL specimens analysed more closely resembled the CD34+ cells than the more differentiated CD19+IgM- cells. This study identified exceptionally high expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) in ALL specimens compared to control cells. CTGF expression was v restricted to B-lineage ALL specimens, however, specimens containing the E2A-PBX1 translocation showed low or no expression. Protein studies by Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of CTGF in ALL cell-conditioned media. The study presented here provides insight into the biology of ALL including the observation that ALL cells have an immature gene expression profile similar to that of CD34+ cells and the possible existence of an autocrine loop involving CTGF. The findings may also have clinical application in the future treatment of ALL, such as the use of metabolic inhibitors or the blocking of CTGF expression. This study provides an important insight into many aspects of ALL disease biology and may offer potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of ALL.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Leukemia in children</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Paediatric</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Leukaemia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical spring parametric interactions in a macroscopic opto-mechanical resonator</field><field name="creator">Schediwy, Sascha W.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The research described in this thesis investigated optical spring interactions and instabilities in a macroscopic opto-mechanical resonator. The thesis describes an experiment designed to model an optical spring `tranquiliser&#8217; cavity which has been proposed to suppress the predicted parametric instabilities in the next generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In a series of experiments, the optical spring effect was observed in macroscopic optical cavities through measured changes in mechanical stiffness, and measured changes in mechanical loss. The optical spring effect was further characterised through investigation of its dependent parameters. Two pairs of identical, low optical loss mirrors were bonded to a mechanical structure using a novel low mechanical loss technique, forming an opto-mechanical composite resonator. The technique uses the naturally occurring resin Yacca gum as a bonding agent. This resulted in the formation of two optical cavities with a length of l = 0.100&#177;0.001m, only one of which was used in experiments. Using finite element modelling, the resonator?s two lowest modes, with frequencies of fm1 = 722.8Hz and fm2 = 747.9Hz, and an effective mass 0.0323&#177;0.0001kg, were found to be subject to the optical spring effect. ... The instabilities are expected to have a parametric gain factor of up to 100 in the frequency range of 15-120kHz. Therefore, if optical spring damping can be made large enough to reduce the Q-factor of the Advanced LIGO test-masses by a factor of 100, all parametric instabilities should be eliminated. For a simple servo loop and an optical cavity with the practically achievable finesse of F = 30,000, a tranquiliser cavity length of 1.3cm was found to produce optimum enhanced damping. This configuration only requires 1.47W of input power, resulting in an intra-cavity power of 5.72kW. The cavity mirrors were assumed to have optical coatings with a damage threshold of 1MW/cm2, which limited the spot size to a minimum area of 0.572mm2, or a radial beam waist of w = 0.427mm. This nearly flat-flat cavity has a stability g-factor of 0.9997. Even given these technical challenges, suppression of the parametric instabilities predicted to occur in the next generation of interferometric detectors is possible to achieve practically using enhanced optical spring damping. A possible design for such a tranquiliser cavity is also suggested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Interferometers</field><field name="subject">Optical springs</field><field name="subject">Experimental physics</field><field name="subject">Cold damping</field><field name="subject">Quality factor</field><field name="subject">Parametric instability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An automated particle and surface classification system</field><field name="creator">Stachowiak, Gwidon P.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The development of an automated classification system of wear particles or surfaces is of great interest to the machine condition monitoring industry.

Such a tool will be able to replace human experts in the detection of the onset of early machine failure, or in the diagnosis and prognosis of, for example, joint diseases. This will improve efficiency, reliability and also reduce costs of monitoring or diagnostic systems. Current literature available on this topic has included various studies on different classification methods. However, there has been no work conducted on the development of a totally integrated automated classification system. The first part of this thesis presents a study investigating the efficiency and robustness of various pattern recognition methods currently described in literature. A special computer program was developed to test each of the classification methods against both standard image databases and tribological surface images. There are three core components of a pattern recognition system that need to be analysed: (1) feature extraction, (2) feature reduction and (3) classifier. Each of these components provides a vital link that can affect the reliability of the complete classification system. ... The optimal classifier was the Linear Support Vector Classifier. This part of research is described in Paper 2. The second part of this thesis contains work verifying the performance of the automated classification system developed using both tribological and bio-tribological surface images. Experiments were carried out to generate wear particles created under different wear mechanisms (adhesive, abrasive and fatigue wear) and various operating conditions representing different degree of wear severity. The automated classification system developed was able to successfully classify wear particles with respect to both the type of wear mechanism operating and the wear severity. The results of this classification are described in Papers 3 and 5. The success of the automated classification system was also confirmed by its ability to classify different groups of worn (osteoarthritic) cartilage surfaces (Paper 4). This could lead to potential applications of the system for early detection of the onset of osteoarthritis. In conclusion, the automated classification system developed can accurately classify both tribological and bio-tribological surface images.

This association reflects developmental programming, a process by which organ systems are affected during early development such that disease states are more likely to emerge in adult life. Fetal glucocorticoid overexposure is thought to be a key factor that mediates developmental programming. Accordingly, maternal treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone retards fetal growth and leads to delayed puberty, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, either with or without increased adiposity, in adult offspring. Importantly, the postnatal environment can either amplify or attenuate the long-term outcome of developmental programming. The focus of this thesis was whether adverse developmental programming outcomes can be attenuated by the postnatal environment and thus provide therapeutic potential. Specifically, the effects of a postnatal diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids on glucocorticoid-induced developmental programming outcomes was investigated. ... The adipocyte phenotype was examined in Study 6, with hyperleptinaemia evident in offspring at 6 and 12 months of age in dexamethasone-exposed animals on a standard omega-3 diet, but this effect was prevented by a high omega-3 diet. The pattern of plasma leptin was paralleled by changes in leptin mRNA in retroperitoneal fat. Similarly, plasma levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and IL-1&#946; were upregulated by prenatal glucocorticoid exposure and these were attenuated by postnatal dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, omega-3 ingestion reduced adiposity, as indicated by measures of body composition. In conclusion, the studies presented in this thesis demonstrate for the first time that many of the detrimental effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure in utero on the adult phenotype can be attenuated by a postnatal diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a reversal of some (e.g. adiposal leptin) but not all (e.g. renal GR) 'programmed' changes in gene expression. These findings raise the possibility that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may provide a viable therapeutic option for preventing and/or reducing adverse programming outcomes in humans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotype</field><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Fetus -- Development</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of policies to ameliorate the environmental impact of cars in Perth City, using the results of a stated preference survey and air pollution modelling</field><field name="creator">Siddique, Sharif Rayhan</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Air pollution is increasingly perceived to be a serious intangible threat to humanity, with air quality continuing to deteriorate in most urban areas. The main sources of inner city pollution are motor vehicles, which generate emissions from the tail pipe as well as by evaporation. These contain toxic gaseous components which have adverse health effects. The major components are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulates (PM10), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). CO and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are major emissions from cars. This study focuses on pollutant concentration in Perth city and has sought to develop measures to improve air quality. To estimate concentrations, the study develops air pollution models for CO and NOx; on the basis of the model estimates, effective policy is devised to improve the air quality by managing travel to the city. Two peaks, due to traffic, are observed in hourly CO and NOx concentrations. Unlike traffic, however, the morning peak does not reach the level of the afternoon peak. The reasons for this divergence are assessed and quantified. Separate causal models of hourly concentrations of CO and NOx explain their fluctuations accurately. They take account of the complex effects of the urban street canyon and winds in the city. The angle of incidence of the wind has significant impact on pollution level; a wind flow from the south-west increases pollution and wind from the north-east decreases it. The models have been shown to be equivalent to engineering and scientific models in estimating emission rate in the context of street canyons. However the study models are much more precise in the Perth context. ... The models are used to calculate the marginal effects for all attributes and elasticity for fuel price. In almost all attributes the non-work group is more responsive than the work group. Finally, the SP model results are integrated into an econometric model for the purpose of prediction. The travel behaviour prediction is used to estimate the policy impact on air quality. The benefit from the air quality improvement is reported in terms of life saved. The estimated relationships between probability of death and air pollution determines the number of lives that could be saved under various policy scenarios. A ratio of benefits to the financial and perceived sacrifices by drivers is calculated to compare the effectiveness of the suggested policies. A car size charge policy was found to be the most cost effective measure to ameliorate the environmental impact of cars in Perth, with a morning peak entry time charge being almost as cost effective. The study demonstrates the need for appropriate modelling of air pollution and travel behaviour. It brings together analytical methods at three levels of causality, vehicle to air pollution, charge to travel response, and air pollution to health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobiles -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Air -- Pollution -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Air -- Pollution -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Transportation -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Air pollution</field><field name="subject">Transport</field><field name="subject">Discrete choice</field><field name="subject">Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the outcomes for students undertaking an externally provided physical activity programme</field><field name="creator">Hutton, Heidi C</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Many primary schools in Western Australia do not employ a specialist physical education (PE) teacher, leaving the teaching of this subject to the class teacher. There are concerns that some of these teachers lack the skills, confidence or knowledge to successfully implement a developmentally appropriate PE programme. A potential solution to this problem involves utilising an externally provided physical activity programme (EPPAP). Before considering this option, it is important to ensure these programmes adequately meet the needs of students, teachers and the educational curriculum. Outcomes for one such EPPAP were evaluated and compared against the outcomes attained in regular primary school PE classes. These outcomes were then compared to the Health and Physical Education (HPE) learning area outcomes (LAO) within Outcomes Based Education (OBE) of the Western Australian Curriculum Framework (CF). Approximately 460 primary school students in the Peel Region of WA participated in the EPPAP and subsequent research in 2004. In addition, approximately 135 students from the same area were invited to participate as controls. All students completed self-report questionnaires pre and post-participation in the EPPAP. ... Although not originally promoted as a programme to replace PE, the EPPAP is delivered within curriculum time with some schools intending to replace their traditional PE programme with the EPPAP. Therefore, reference to the CF is warranted. There were few opportunities to develop `skills for physical activity? (SPA) transferable to the sporting context and explicit teaching points were not consistently provided, or reinforced through teacher feedback. Activities in the lessons were generally delivered uniformly to all participants across Year 4-7 with no developmental theme, negating the opportunity for differentiation, progression or extension. In summary, the main objectives of the EPPAP was to provide students with a range of fun activities and games that were inclusive and encouraged participation. These objectives were fulfilled in this two-term evaluation. The disadvantages of the programme were it?s uniform delivery across all year groups, lack of developmental progression in both skills and games and a teacher centred approach that did not allow for student differentiation. The programme delivery and content was most suited to the students within Years K-3.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum planning -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Physical education and training -- Western Australia -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness -- Western Australia -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Educational evaluation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Physical education and training -- Study and teaching (Primary) -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Physical education</field><field name="subject">Primary students</field><field name="subject">Curriculum framework</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">P-wave velocity model for the southwest of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia and its relation to the local geology and seismicity</field><field name="creator">Galybin, Konstantin A</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A number of controlled and natural seismic sources are utilised to model the Pwave velocity structure of the southwest of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. The Yilgarn Craton is one of the largest pieces of Archaean crust in the world and is known for its gold and nickel deposits in the east and intraplate seismicity in the west. The aim of the project is to link 2D and 3D models of variations in seismic velocity with the local seismicity and geology. A new set of seismic refraction data, acquired in 25 overlapping deployments between 2002 and 2005, has been processed, picked and analysed using forward modelling. The data comprise two perpendicular traverses of three-component recordings of various delay-fired blasts from local commercial quarries. The data were processed using a variety of techniques. Tests were carried out on a number of data enhancement and picking procedures in order to determine the best method for enhancement of delay-fired data. A new method for automatic phase recognition is presented, where the maximum of the derivative of the rectilinearity of a trace is taken as the first break. Complete shot gathers with first break picks for each seismic source are compiled from the overlapping deployments. ... The starting 3D model was based on the models produced by 2D forward modelling. 14 iterations were carried out and the best-fit 3D model was achieved at the 10th iteration. It is 35% better then the current model used to locate earthquakes in this region. The resultant velocity block model was used to iii construct a density block model. A relative gravity map of the southwest of Yilgarn Craton was made. The results of 2D forward modelling, 3D tomography and forward gravity modelling have been compared and it was found that the HVZ is present in all models. Such a zone has been previously seen on a single seismic refraction profile, but it is the first time, this zone has been mapped in 3D. The gravity high produced by the zone coincides with the gravity high observed in reality. There is strong evidence that suggests that the HVZ forms part of the Archaean terrane boundary within the Yilgarn Craton. The distribution of the local seismicity was then discussed in the framework of the new 3D velocity model. A hypothesis, that the primary control on the seismicity in the study area is rotation of the major horizontal stress orientation, is presented. It is also argued that the secondary control on seismicity in the SWSZ is accommodation of movements along major faults.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology -- Western Australia -- Yilgarn Craton</field><field name="subject">Earthquake hazard analysis -- Western Australia -- Yilgarn Craton</field><field name="subject">Seismic tomography -- Western Australia -- Yilgarn Craton</field><field name="subject">Seismic waves -- Data processing</field><field name="subject">Seismic waves -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Yilgarn Craton (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">South west seismic zone</field><field name="subject">Earthquake tomography</field><field name="subject">Seismic inversion</field><field name="subject">Yilgarn Craton</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of dormancy, preharvest sprouting tolerance and how they are influenced by the environment during grain filling and maturation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</field><field name="creator">Biddulph, Thomas Benjamin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Wheat is the main crop in Australia and there are stringent quality requirements. Preharvest sprouting induced by rainfall between maturity and harvest lowers grain quality from premium to feed grades and reduces yield. Wheat production has expanded into the southern Western Australian region where preharvest sprouting occurs in ~1 in 4 seasons and development of more preharvest sprouting tolerant genotypes is required. The main mechanism for improving preharvest sprouting tolerance is grain dormancy. There is genetic variation for dormancy based in the embryo and seed coat but dormancy is complex and is influenced by environmental conditions during grain filling and maturation. Screening and selecting for preharvest sprouting tolerance is problematic and the level of tolerance needed for regions which differ in the level of dormancy they impose, requires clarification. The research presented here aims to answer the underlying question for breeders of how much dormancy is required for preharvest sprouting tolerance in contrasting target environments of the central and coastal wheat belt regions of Western Australia. In the central and coastal wheat belt regions, field trials with modified environments were used to determine the environmental influence on dormancy. Water supply (without directly wetting the grain) and air temperature were modified during grain development in a range of genotypes with different mechanisms of dormancy to determine the influence of environment on dormancy. ... Genotypes with embryo dormancy were consistently the most preharvest sprouting tolerant, even though this dormancy was influenced by the environmental conditions in the different seasons. Pyramiding the embryo component with the specific seed coat component and/or awnless head trait removed some of the environmental variation in preharvest sprouting tolerance, but this was generally considered excessive to the environmental requirements. The methods developed here, of field imposed stresses may provide a valuable tool to further understand the influence of environment on the regulation of dormancy, as different phenotypes can be made with the same genotype. Moisture stress, sudden changes in water supply or high temperatures during the late dough stages influenced dormancy phenotype and should be considered and avoided if possible when selecting locations and running trials for screening for genetic differences in preharvest sprouting tolerance. In the Western Australian context, the embryo component of dormancy appeared to be sufficient and should be adopted as the most important trait for breeding for preharvest sprouting tolerance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Abscisic acid</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Preharvest sprouting</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Yields -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Dormancy</field><field name="subject">Preharvest sprouting</field><field name="subject">Wheat</field><field name="subject">Grain quality</field><field name="subject">Heat stress</field><field name="subject">Drought</field><field name="subject">Dormacy</field><field name="subject">Falling number</field><field name="subject">ABA</field><field name="subject">Dormancy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of clinical practice guidelines for the prediction and prevention of pressure ulcers</field><field name="creator">Prentice, Jennifer Lorna</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Pressure ulcers affect a substantial proportion of patients admitted to health care services worldwide imposing considerable physical, social and economic burdens on patients and communities. As largely preventable wounds their prevalence is likely to escalate as the life expectancy and incidence of people living longer with other chronic diseases increases. Clinical practice guidelines are promulgated as evidence-based tools to assist clinicians and patients to determine care strategies, reduce inequities in healthcare provision and lower the burden of illness through improved health outcomes. This prospective multi-centre study evaluated the effectiveness of the Australian Wound Management Association?s Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prediction and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers within ten selected Australian tertiary hospitals. The data, collected in 2000, examined pressure ulcer prevalence in a subset of five of these hospitals and junior doctors&#8217; and nurses&#8217; knowledge of pressure ulcers in all ten hospitals at two time points, before and after guideline implementation. Pressure ulcer prevalence was ascertained by two surveyors who independently examined the skin of all consenting adult patients on a designated day. ... In addition, it is recommended that all Australian health care facilities providing in-patient, residential aged or domiciliary care services be required to demonstrate compliance with the Australian Council of Health Care Standards framework for pressure ulcers in order to be an accredited healthcare provider. The use, benefits and cost utility of pressure reducing / relieving devices in the prediction and prevention of pressure ulcers in Australian contexts of care, is required to substantiate current guideline recommendations and assist service providers and clinicians in choosing devices according to patient need. A recommendation will be forwarded to the Australian Wound Management Association suggesting the Association develop a toolkit to facilitate implementation and adoption of their guidelines. It is recommended that training of doctors, nurses and allied health personnel in the prediction, prevention and management of pressure ulcers should be of a higher priority within under-and-postgraduate education programs. From a community perspective and with a view to improving the health of the community, it is proposed that pressure ulcers be the subject of ongoing health promotion campaigns aimed at raising patients&#8217;, caregivers&#8217; and community awareness of the potential for pressure ulcers due to the secondary effects of lifestyle related chronic diseases and ensuing reduced levels of immobility.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bedsores -- Prevention -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Bedsores -- Diagnosis -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for persistent asthma in adolescents : a community based longitudinal birth cohort</field><field name="creator">Deverell, Marie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Asthma is a chronic and complex disorder and despite our increase in the understanding of the genetics, pathology and mechanisms underlying asthma a gold standard definition of asthma does not exist. A criterion for recognising and diagnosing asthma in epidemiological studies is crucial in order to determine risk factors for disease. Prospective longitudinal birth cohort studies have increased our understanding of the natural history and risk factors for asthma, yet we are still not able to accurately predict which children will go on to have asthma as adults. It is during the transition from childhood to adolescence where factors underlying asthma change and the prevalence of asthma shifts between the sexes. There are inconsistencies regarding risk factors for the development and persistence of disease during this transitional period. Risk factors predicting the development and persistence of asthma and intermediate phenotypes (BHR, airway inflammation and atopy) may be influenced by gender and risk factors predicting disease may differ between childhood and adolescence. Aims 1. To identify risk factors for Asthma, BHR and Atopy at 14yrs of age. 2. To determine risk factors for persistence of asthma between 6 and 14 years. 3. To examine the influence of gender on risk factors during adolescence. Method The West Australian Pregnancy Cohort is a longitudinal birth cohort. The cohort initially consisted of 2868 live births with follow-ups at 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 14 years of V age. ... Strong associations were seen with BHR and new diagnosis of wheeze and asthma in VI teenagers. Interestingly having either a cat or dog inside was protective for persistence of disease; in particular stronger associations were seen in teenage girls not in boys. During this transitional period the risk factors for asthma and intermediate phenotypes differ between the sexes. Different mechanisms are likely to be involved in determining asthma in boys and girls during adolescence and shed new light on the recognised switch in the gender balance in asthma prevalence from the male predominance in childhood to the female predominance in adult life. Our understanding of the natural course of disease from the prenatal period to adulthood and the identification of the various asthma phenotypes has the potential to change prognosis and planning of therapeutic strategies. Identifying those at high risk for persistence of disease in the early stages of life will allow therapeutic interventions to be more appropriately targeted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma -- Western Australia -- Longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Chronic diseases in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Asthma in children</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Cohort</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional and radiological evaluation of autologous chondrocyte implantation using a type I/III collagen membrane:  from single defect treatment to early osteoarthritis</field><field name="creator">Robertson, William Brett</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Hyaline articular cartilage is a highly specialised tissue consisting of chondrocytes embedded in a matrix of proteoglycan and collagens. Hyaline articular cartilage withstands high levels of mechanical stress and continuously renews its extracellular matrix. Despite this durability, mature articular cartilage is vulnerable to injury and disease processes that cause irreparable tissue damage. Native hyaline articular cartilage has poor regenerative capacity following injury, largely due to the tissue's lack of blood and lymphatic supply, as well as the inability of native chondrocytes to migrate through the dense extracellular matrix into the defect site. Articular cartilage injuries that fail to penetrate the subchondral bone plate evoke only a short-lived metabolic and enzymatic response, which fails to provide sufficient new cells or matrix to repair even minimal damage. Clinically, it has previously been accepted that treatment of such defects does not result in the restoration of normal hyaline articular cartilage, which is able to withstand the mechanical demands that are placed on the joint during every day activities of daily living. ...

Patients should not be left to their own devices following ACI surgery, as the risk of damage to their implant (via delamination) is high if immediate postoperative movement is not controlled.

The scaled boundary finite-element method is a newly developed semi-analytical technique to solve systems of partial differential equations. It works by employing a special local coordinate system, called scaled boundary coordinate system, to define the computational field, and then weakening the partial differential equation in the circumferential direction with the standard finite elements whilst keeping the equation strong in the radial direction, finally analytically solving the resulting system of equations, termed the scaled boundary finite-element equation. This unique feature of the scaled boundary finite-element method enables it to combine many of advantages of the finite-element method and the boundaryelement method with the features of its own. ... In this thesis, both first-order and second-order solutions of wave diffraction problems are presented in the context of scaled boundary finite-element analysis. In the first-order wave diffraction analysis, the boundary-value problems governed by the Laplace equation or by the Helmholtz equation are considered. The solution methods for bounded domains and unbounded domains are described in detail. The solution process is implemented and validated by practical numerical examples. The numerical examples examined include well benchmarked problems such as wave reflection and transmission by a single horizontal structure and by two structures with a small gap, wave radiation induced by oscillating bodies in heave, sway and roll motions, wave diffraction by vertical structures with circular, elliptical, rectangular cross sections and harbour oscillation problems. The numerical results are compared with the available analytical solutions, numerical solutions with other conventional numerical methods and experimental results to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scaled boundary finite-element method. The computed results show that the scaled boundary finite-element method is able to accurately model the singularity of velocity field near sharp corners and to satisfy the radiation condition with ease. It is worth nothing that the scaled boundary finite-element method is completely free of irregular frequency problem that the Green's function methods often suffer from. For the second-order wave diffraction problem, this thesis develops solution schemes for both monochromatic wave and bichromatic wave cases, based on the analytical expression of first-order solution in the radial direction. It is found that the scaled boundary finiteelement method can produce accurate results of second-order wave loads, due to its high accuracy in calculating the first-order velocity field.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boundary element methods</field><field name="subject">Boundary value problems</field><field name="subject">Differential equations, Elliptic</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Harmonic functions</field><field name="subject">Helmholtz equation</field><field name="subject">Waves -- Diffraction</field><field name="subject">Scaled boundary finite element method</field><field name="subject">Singularity</field><field name="subject">Helmholtz equation</field><field name="subject">Wave diffraction</field><field name="subject">Laplace equation</field><field name="subject">Second order wave force</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power control for mobile radio systems using perceptual speech quality metrics</field><field name="creator">Rohani Mehdiabadi, Behrooz</field><field name="description">As the characteristics of mobile radio channels vary over time, transmit power must be controlled accordingly to ensure that the received signal level is within the receiver's sensitivity. As a consequence, modern mobile radio systems employ power control to regulate the received signal level such that it is neither less nor excessively larger than receiver sensitivity in order to maintain adequate service quality. In this context, speech quality measurement is an important aspect in the delivery of speech services as it will impact satisfaction of customers as well as the usage of precious system resources. A variety of techniques for speech quality measurement has been produced over the last few years as result of tireless research in the area of perceptual speech quality estimation. These are mainly based on psychoacoustic models of the human auditory systems. However, these techniques cannot be directly applied for real-time communication purposes as they typically require a copy of the transmitted and received speech signals for their operation. This thesis presents a novel technique of incorporating perceptual speech quality metrics with power control for mobile radio systems. The technique allows for standardized perceptual speech quality measurement algorithms to be used for in-service measurement of speech quality. The accuracy of the proposed Real-Time Perceptual Speech Quality Measurement (RTPSQM) technique with respect to measuring speech quality is first validated by extensive simulations. On this basis, RTPSQM is applied to power control in the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication and the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). It is shown by simulations that the use of perceptual-based power control in GSM and UMTS outperforms conventional power control in terms of reducing the transmitter signal power required for providing adequate speech quality. This in turn facilitates the observed increase in system capacity and thus offers better utilization of available system resources. To enable an analytical performance assessment of perceptual speech quality metrics in power control, the mathematical frameworks for conventional and perceptual-based power control are derived. The derivations are performed for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems and kept as generic as possible. Numerical results are presented which could be used in a system design to readily find the Erlang capacity per cell for either of the considered power control algorithms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech processing systems</field><field name="subject">Speech perception -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Power control</field><field name="subject">Perceptual</field><field name="subject">Speech quality</field><field name="subject">Perceptual speech quality</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advances in the development of the scaled boundary method for applications in fracture mechanics</field><field name="creator">Chidgzey, Steven R.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The scaled boundary method is a powerful, though undervalued, computational analysis method. The complex mathematics of the original derivation of the method has rendered it unattractive to researchers. However, the method has proven more efficient than conventional computational analysis methods for problems involving unbounded domains and for problems involving stress singularities. The advantages of the scaled boundary method in dealing with stress singularities make it uniquely suited to the analysis of fracture mechanics problems. This study will extend the capabilities of the scaled boundary method, exploring fracture mechanics applications in particular. Only benchmark elastostatic fracture mechanics problems are analysed as the focus of this work is the development of the scaled boundary method. It will be demonstrated that the intimidating mathematics of the method can be distilled into an elegant method which offers considerable advantages when used in the analysis of crack problems. This thesis will argue that the advantages of the scaled boundary method make it more valuable than is generally perceived and that coming to grips with the sometimes intimidating method is worthwhile. In this study, a significant contribution is made to the development of the scaled boundary method with a number of advances. The scaled boundary method is used to determine the higher order terms in asymptotic crack tip fields. The higher order terms play an important role in characterising the behaviour of cracked structures, but can only be evaluated analytically for a few simple cases. The higher order terms for a number of crack configurations are calculated using the scaled boundary method. Excellent agreement with results obtained from the literature is demonstrated. A penalty formulation is developed for use with a recently developed solution procedure for the scaled boundary method. The new solution procedure is based on the theory of matrix functions and the real Schur decomposition. ... A study is presented of error estimation and adaptivity procedures for use with the scaled boundary method when a reduced set of base functions is used. The error estimation procedure based on the superconvergent patch recovery technique and the error estimation procedure based on reference solutions are modified for use with the scaled boundary method when a reduced set of base functions is used. The use of a reduced set of base functions in an adaptivity procedure for the scaled boundary method is trialled. Adaptivity based solely on the set of base functions is shown to be inefficient. In contrast, the judicious use of a reduced set of base functions is shown to improve the overall efficiency of other adaptivity procedures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Boundary element methods</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Scaled boundary method</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scales of interactions between physical processes, primary producers and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Hillmer Kiekebusch, Ingrid Andrea</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Estimating internal biogeochemical fluxes is essential to the understanding of the dynamic of aquatic ecosystems. Different ecological approaches have been used to gain insight into the internal cycling, but success has been limited. A critical point is the identification of the characteristic scales of patterns and the underlying processes affecting the behaviour of biological and chemical species. Failing to capture these scales leads to misinterpretation of field and numerical data. In this study, key aspects in the design of ecological surveys are identified to ensure that the internal biogeochemical processes are well represented. In the first part of this thesis, a 1D reaction-diffusion-advection equation is used to investigate the formation of patterns and relevant time and spatial scales. This is used to define an approach for the determination of a critical domain size that allows differentiation of the role of local and internal cycling from advective fluxes across the open boundaries in a shallow coastal ecosystem. By using a 3D numerical model, in conjunction with an extensive field data set, it is shown that domain sizes must be larger than this critical value in order to capture the patterns generated within the system. For smaller domains, transport processes control the evolution of the system across the boundaries misleading the interpretation of the internal ecological dynamics. The study of the influence of boundary fluxes on ecological patchiness was motivated by the need to define the size of the domain necessary for the assessment of the impact of a sewage outflow on a coastal regime. The quantification of biogeochemical processes has proven to be difficult to achieve especially under conditions of high spatial and temporal hydrodynamic and biogeochemical variability. In the second part of this thesis, a Lagrangian experimental design is employed to estimate biogeochemical rate coefficients in situ. A set of four drogues and a cross-transect sampling design is used to capture the patchy distribution of phytoplankton and nutrient species, and high transport and mixing rates. ... Total chlorophyll from both models shows similar behavior when the variability in the 3D model, expressed as Chlamax/Chlamin, is low. When Chlamax/Chlamin is high, the difference between the biomass predicted by the two models reaches 30% due to the generation of localised patches. Comparison of the 1D and 3D results highlights the need of using models that are able to resolve the spatial complexity to some extent, as the use of averaged properties may produce misleading results. This is especially important in the presence of patches with differential physiological and biogeochemical characteristics, and nonlinear processes, in which case biomass average is not necessarily linearly related to the averaged environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biogeochemical cycles -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology</field><field name="subject">Lagrange equations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the interaction between the physical and ecological processes of three aquatic ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Louise Christina</field><field name="description">Due to the complex nature of aquatic food webs, the interaction between abiotic and biotic factors that govern ecosystem dynamics is often elusive.

In the first, the role of zooplankton in the nutrient cycles of Lake Kinneret, Israel was quantified. The model was parameterized and calibrated using an extensive field data set. It was found that the excretion of dissolved nutrients by zooplankton accounted for up to 58% of phytoplankton demand and that this value varied seasonally in response to patterns of stratification and mixing. In the second ecosystem, Mono Lake, USA, results from model simulations were studied to determine the significance of the transport of nutrient rich hypolimnetic water via the benthic boundary layer (BBL) on lake productivity. Model results indicated that although on average the impact of BBL transport on Mono Lake ecology was not large, significant nutrient fluxes were simulated during periods when BBL transport was most active. The timing of these fluxes in the context of seasonal changes were found to be critical to specific aspects of food web dynamics. In the final application, the ecological gradients of the primary salt ponds of Shark Bay, Australia were studied with specific focus on the role of zooplankton as a determinant of ecosystem dynamics. Model results indicated that zooplankton grazing was responsible for reduced water column particulate organic matter and increased light available for the development of microbial mats. However, no direct 8 link between zooplankton grazing and observed changes in planktonic algal species composition or nutrient limitation across the salinity gradient of the ponds was found. Results from this study demonstrate the potential of a lake ecosystem model to extract useful process information to complement field data collection and address questions related to the relationship between physical and ecological processes in aquatic ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Zooplankton -- Ecology</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology -- California -- Mono Lake</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology -- Israel -- Tiberias, Lake</field><field name="subject">Limnological study</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Higher order contributions to the effective action of N = 2 and 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories from heat kernel techniques in superspace</field><field name="creator">Grasso, Darren Trevor</field><field name="description">The one-loop effective action for N = 2 and N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are computed to order F5; and F6 respectively by the use of heat kernel techniques in N = 1 superspace.

This phrase signals not only a series of state-directed projects to make China a 'modern' nation, but also a self-conscious desire to find a new sense of national importance and 'Chineseness'. This nationalist self-consciousness is not new, but it indicates a desire to leave China's socialist past behind and become a world power in the new millennium. This thesis explores the complex and heightened manifestations of national pride and identity that have emerged since the era of opening up. Its central question examines how a renewed form of Chineseness, with a specific focus on a fresh form of Chinese same-sex identity, is articulated in both nationalist and globalist terms, with particular reference to China's opening up. This thesis thus contributes to an understanding of how Chinese same-sex identity in urban China is variously constructed and celebrated; how it is transformed; and how it presents its resistances in the context of China's opening up to the mighty flux of globalisation. In doing so, the research illuminates how seemingly modern and authentic Chinese gay and lesbian identities in urban China come into being at the intersection of certain competing discourses. These discourses are predominantly represented in the contexts of 1) an increasingly globalised gay culture, 2) the ongoing construction of an indigenous Chinese identity, 3) a hybridised transnational/Chinese identity, and 4) the emergence of a gay space in Chinese cyberspace. By indicating how these discourses are simultaneously globalised, localised and deterritorialised, and are necessarily entangled with global power relations, I demonstrate how an essentialised notion of Chinese same-sex identity is continuously transformed by the imaginary power of China's opening up to broader contexts. I conclude that it is within the paradigm of China's opening up to the current globalising world that same-sex identity in urban China, as a rapidly changing notion, can best be understood. ... To an extent, the articulation of seemingly modern and authentic Chinese gay and lesbian identities in urban China is in a state of continuous tension between opening up to a global identity and preserving a local authenticity. Furthermore, the development of these gay and lesbian identities is conditioned and regulated by political thought and action. In this way, political conditioning ensures control and conformity in the articulation of Chinese (same-sex) identity in a self-censored (or ziwo shencha) manner. Most fundamentally, self-censorship is practised more effectively at an individual level than at a state level. Against this background, I argue that the articulation of same-sex identity in urban China is paradoxical: open and decentred, but at the same time, nationalist and conforming to state control.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gays -- China -- Identity</field><field name="subject">Lesbians -- China -- Identity</field><field name="subject">Gender identity -- China</field><field name="subject">China -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Same-sex identity</field><field name="subject">Tongxinglian</field><field name="subject">Kaifang</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific hybridization in Leucadendron : capacity building and phylogenetic insights</field><field name="creator">Liu, Hui</field><field name="description">Flowers from members of the genus Leucadendron have colourful bracts and long vase life that make them highly desirable cut-flowers. Breeding programs based on interspecific hybridization would encounter difficulty if pre- or post-fertilization barriers exist in the distant crosses. Embryo rescue is one of the commonly used approaches to overcome post-fertilization barriers in wide hybridization. In this study, intersectional and intersubsectional hybridization of Leucadendron was attempted. Observation of pollen-pistil interactions revealed that post-zygotic rejection was the main reason for the incompatibility of the crosses, therefore embryo rescue was adopted and a protocol was developed to raise the hybrids. To better understand the genome structure in the genus, karyotypes of selected species were analyzed. Chromosome examination indicated that all (27) Leucadendron species examined were diploid and had a chromosome number of 2n = 26. The chromosomes were small in size and had predominantly median to submedian centromeres. The karyotypes of the species were rather symmetrical and seemed to be primitive according to Stebbins' karyotype classification. DNA based PCR-RFLP and RAMP markers were developed to identify Leucadendron hybrids at an early age. RAMP analysis showed more discrimination in identifying Leucadendron hybrids than did PCR-RFLP. The occurrence of PCR recombination also proved to be a troublesome issue when using the PCR-RFLP method, whereas the clarity of the interpretion of the RAMP method was not influenced by PCR recombination. Interspecific hybridization in a breeding program can provide valuable information on grouping of the species for systematic purposes. Regression analysis between cross success rate and cpDNA character difference revealed that there was a highly significant correlation between them. Patterns of success for intersectional hybridizations in Leucadendron were generally consistent with current taxonomic hypotheses regarding the sectional division of the genus. Success was generally lower for intersectional crosses than for intrasectional crosses.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cut flowers</field><field name="subject">Proteaceae -- Breeding</field><field name="subject">Leucadendron -- Breeding</field><field name="subject">Leucadendron -- Molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Hybridization</field><field name="subject">Interspecific hybridization</field><field name="subject">Karyotype</field><field name="subject">Embryo rescue</field><field name="subject">Hybrid identification</field><field name="subject">Phylogenetic relationship</field><field name="subject">Leucadendron</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of dryland salinity on Ross River virus in south-western Australia : an ecosystem health perspective</field><field name="creator">Jardine, Andrew</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A functional ecosystem is increasingly being recognised as a requirement for health and well being of resident human populations. Clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has left 1.047 million hectares of south-west Western Australia affected by a severe form of environmental degradation, dryland salinity, characterised by secondary soil salinisation and waterlogging. This area may expand by a further 1.7-3.4 million hectares if current trends continue. Ecosystems in saline affected regions display many of the classic characteristics of Ecosystem Distress Syndrome (EDS). One outcome of EDS that has not yet been investigated in relation to dryland salinity is adverse human health implications. This thesis focuses on one such potential adverse health outcome: increased incidence of Ross River virus (RRV), the most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia. Spatial analysis of RRV notifications did not reveal a significant association with dryland salinity. To overcome inherent limitations with notification data, serological RRV antibody prevalence was also investigated, and again no significant association with dryland salinity was detected. However, the spatial scale imposed limited the sensitivity of both studies. ... This thesis represents the first attempt to prospectively investigate the influence of secondary soil salinity on mosquito-borne disease by combining entomological, environmental and epidemiological data. The evidence collected indicates that RRV disease incidence is not currently a significant population health priority in areas affected by dryland salinity despite the dominant presence of Ae. camptorhynchus. Potential limiting factors include; local climatic impact on the seasonal mosquito population dynamics; vertebrate host distribution and feeding behaviour of Ae. camptorhynchus; and the scarce and uneven human population distribution across the region. However, the potential for increased disease risk in dryland salinity affected areas to become apparent in the future cannot be discounted, particularly in light of the increasing extent predicted to develop over coming decades before any benefits of amelioration strategies are observed. Finally, it is important to note that both dryland salinity and salinity induced by irrigation are important forms of environmental degradation in arid and semi-arid worldwide, with a total population of over 400 million people. Potential health risks will of course vary widely across different regions depending on a range of factors specific to the local region and the complex interactions between them. It is therefore not possible to make broad generalisations. The need is highlighted for similar research in other regions and it is contended that an ecosystem health framework provides the necessary basis for such investigations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arbovirus infections -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Mosquitoes as carriers of disease -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem health</field><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Ross River virus -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Ross River virus</field><field name="subject">Ecosystem health</field><field name="subject">Dryland salinity</field><field name="subject">Mosquito-borne disease</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the relationship between the built environment and psychosocial correlates of physical activity behaviour</field><field name="creator">McCormack, Gavin Robert</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The main purpose of this research was to conduct a series of studies with the aim of contributing information about methods for measuring and analyzing physical environmental attributes of neighbourhoods and the influence of these attributes on specific types of physical activity behaviour. Furthermore, this research examined the moderating affect of the objective physical environment on the relationship between cognitions and physical activity behaviours and the mediating role of the cognitions on the associations between the objective physical environment and physical activity. The research included secondary analyses of data collected as part of the Studies of Environmental and Individual Determinants of Physical Activity (SEID1 and SEID2: Corti 1998; Pikora 2003) and the Physical Activity in Localities and Community Environments study (PLACE: Leslie et al. 2005a; Leslie et al. 2005b). Demographic, cognitive, social and behavioural data from the baseline and follow-up surveys from SEID1 (Corti 1998), and objectively measured built environmental data from SEID2 (Pikora 2003) were analyzed. ... A stronger association between frequency of past trying and recreational walking was also found for respondents residing in neighbourhoods with more recreational destinations (&#946; = 0.11), compared with fewer destinations (&#946; = 0.00). These findings show some evidence that the built environment can affect exercise-related cognitions, which in turn influence physical activity. Findings of this and other research (Owen et al. 2000; Humpel et al. 2002; Saelens et al. 2003b; Foster &amp; Hillsdon 2004; McCormack et al. 2004; Owen et al. 2004; Badland &amp; Schofield 2005; Duncan et al. 2005; Heath et al. 2006) support the need to create supportive environments that encourage both recreational and transport-related physical activity. Providing more opportunities and a greater variety of destinations close to home could encourage physical activity participation, and may even assist some individuals to achieve sufficient levels to accrue health benefits. However, additional research is necessary to understand how both the perceived and objectively measured built environment influences physical activity and to provide evidence of temporal causality between environments, cognitions, and physical activity behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health behavior</field><field name="subject">Urban health</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Health aspects -- Research -- Methodology</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Built environment</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Ecological model</field><field name="subject">Health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes</field><field name="creator">Shub, Alexis</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Periodontal disease is a common and underdiagnosed disease in humans that may have adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effects of periodontal disease in pregnancy by means of two observational human studies and the development of animal models of fetal and uterine exposure to periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide. I performed a prospective study examining the rates of preterm birth, small for gestational age neonates and neonatal inflammation in 277 women who had undergone a detailed antenatal periodontal examination and oral health questionnaire. Periodontal disease was associated with small for gestational age neonates, and increased CRP levels in umbilical cord blood, but no effect was seen on the rate of preterm birth. Maternal oral health symptoms predicted both periodontal disease and newborn biometry. In a retrospective case control study, I examined the role of periodontal disease in perinatal mortality. Participants included 53 women who had experienced a perinatal loss for which no cause could be found after thorough investigation, and 111 control women. Women who had experienced a perinatal loss were more than twice as likely as controls to have periodontal disease. The incidence of periodontal disease was even higher in women in whom the perinatal loss was due to extreme prematurity. In contrast to my prospective study, risks to the pregnancy could not be predicted by maternal oral health behaviours or oral health symptoms. In order to better understand the mechanisms regulating the associations described in the human studies, two animal models were developed; one to investigate acute exposure and the second to investigate long-term exposure to periodontal pathogens. The first study examined the effects of administration of a bolus of periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide to the pregnant sheep. Injection of bacteria and lipopolysaccharide in the amniotic fluid of the pregnant preterm sheep caused a high rate of fetal lethality, disturbance of fetal acid base status and inflammation of the fetus and membranes. Given the circumstances of exposure to periodontopathic pathogens in human periodontal disease, a model investigating long-term exposure to periodontopathic lipopolysaccharide on pregnancy outcomes was developed. ... Overall, I have demonstrated that maternal periodontal disease is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including fetal growth restriction and possibly perinatal loss. Mechanisms regulating these effects are likely to be mediated by fetal adaptations to intrauterine inflammation resulting in altered fetal development, growth or survival. Randomised controlled trials that are currently in progress will provide further information on the effects of periodontal disease in human pregnancy, and the efficacy of treatment to reduce these adverse outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mouth -- Care and hygiene -- Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Prenatal care</field><field name="subject">Periodontics</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Pregnant women -- Dental care</field><field name="subject">Preterm birth</field><field name="subject">Perinatal death</field><field name="subject">Periodontal disease</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy complications</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of flow around vertical cylinders</field><field name="creator">Ou, Zhiliang</field><field name="description">Local scour around bridge piers can cause serious damages and structural failure to the bridge. Correct prediction of the scour is an important criterion for the engineering design. Though the subject has been investigated for many decades, the theoretical developments have been very limited due to the complicated interaction of three-dimensional flow and the sediment transport. This thesis concerns the flow around a vertical bottom mounted cylinder exposed to currents and is considered as the initial phase of a study towards modeling local scour around vertical bottom-mounted structures. The aim of the present study is to obtain a better understanding of the complex three-dimensional flow and the mechanisms related to the scouring. The study started with the development of a three-dimensional numerical model to simulate flow around cylindrical structures. After validation of the model, the model was applied to investigate flow around an isolated rectangular cylinder. Unsteady flows around cylinders of a square cross section (A/D = 1) and a rectangular cross section (A/D = 2) were simulated to understand the flow properties around a cylinder other than a circular cross section. Three-dimensional flow patterns, pressure distribution, forces on the cylinder and vortex-shedding frequencies were discussed. It was found that the present numerical results generally agree well with the experimental data. Flow around a vertical cylinder mounted on a rigid bed was then investigated by the numerical model. A circular and a square cross sections were considered respectively. Flow structures of horseshoe vortex and the wake vortex which are the major mechanisms leading to the scouring around the base of the vertical cylinder were explored. The bed shear stress distributions that directly affect the scour processes were discussed. Finally the numerical model was applied to study the flow around a submerged square cylinder mounted on a bed, which has significant engineering relevance to the local scour around structures, such as bridge pier foundation itself, or a caisson placed underwater around the pier bottom for scour protection. The numerical calculations were carried out at different cylinder heights to investigate the effect of the cylinder height on the flow properties. It was found that for submerged cylinders with the height of less than one and a half of the cylinder side width the maximum bed shear stress amplification is about 60% of the value of an infinite long cylinder. The quantification of the shear stress reduction is important for scour protection design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">Scour (Hydraulic engineering) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Cylinders -- Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Numerical simulation</field><field name="subject">Flow cylinder</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced test mass suspensions and electrostatic control for AIGO</field><field name="creator">Lee, Benjamin H</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the research done towards the development of the final mirror suspension stage for the high power test facility at AIGO, Western Australia. One of the goals of the facility is to test advanced suspension methods that may be useful in future gravitational wave detectors. An in depth study of current mirror suspension techniques is presented and areas of possible improvement are highlighted. The extension of an existing suspension modelling toolkit written in Mathematica is also presented, where added functions allow one to include the violin modes of a suspension into their analysis. Through this tool, new suspension geometries boasting a lower number of violin modes with lower Q factors where developed. The orthogonal ribbon suspension and the thin tube suspension boast a lower number of lower Q violin modes compared to typical ribbon suspensions. For the latter, a reduction in the number of violin modes below 5kHz down to 5 and peak thermal noise amplitude by approximately 30dB is predicted. Presented also is the affect that such suspension geometries have on pendulum mode dilution factor and overall suspension thermal noise. It is seen that the violin mode improvement comes at a cost of a small increase in thermal noise above approximately 50Hz. A theoretical analysis of the AIGO cavity locking control scheme is also given. Issues of sensor noise and dynamic range are considered to produce a possible hierarchical locking method that would be compatible with advanced detectors. The resulting actuator force range requirements for AIGO at each actuation location on the vibration isolation system are given. Requirements of local controls before achieving cavity lock are also discussed. Finally, the suspension of a dummy sapphire mirror using removable modular niobium ribbons is presented. The design and performance of an electrostatic actuator and sensor for suspended mirror control is given.

The further distress and/or trauma for children, which is engendered by separation from their families and placement with strangers, is exacerbated by circumstances of transience and instability that many children experience during their care journeys. The study examines the care system as a circumstance of adversity and seeks to find out how specialist practitioners working in the care environment understand the notion of resilience and whether they operationalise the concept in their practice to assist children in care. The study is set within a critically reflective perspective, informed by a hermeneutic process that assists in building a deeper understanding of both the notion of resilience and the care system through the lived experiences of practitioners and interpretation of the literature on both topics. An unanticipated finding that emerged from research discussions conducted with practitioners revealed that their experiences of working within the care system created a sense of adversity for them and challenged their resilience, with many parallels between their responses and their observations of the distress and trauma of children in care. The necessity to understand these practitioners? experiences more deeply led to a further exploration of literature that described the impact of working in such adverse settings. This exploration uncovered the notion of vicarious traumatisation, a phenomenon that affects workers who are in continual contact with the trauma of others. An indepth discussion of this concept is provided outlining its relevance to this study. The implications of the impact of the adversity of the care environment on professionals are summarised in the final chapter of the study together with recommendations in the areas of both practice and research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foster home care -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Foster children -- Mental health</field><field name="subject">Resilience (Personality trait) in children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on hepatic progenitor cells and the pathologies of experimental hepatocarcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">Davies, Richard</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major malignancy complicating chronic liver disease. New therapies for the prevention of HCC are required due to the limited success and high tumour recurrence rates of existing treatments. Emerging evidence suggests that HCC arise from the transformation of adult liver progenitor cells (LPCs), which have the capacity to differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary cells during liver regeneration. LPC activation precedes neoplasia in experimental hepatocarcinogenesis. LPCs share antigenic epitopes with HCCs, including &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP) and M2- pyruvate kinase (M2PK). In animal models of hepatocarcinogenesis, attenuation of the LPC response reduces the incidence of HCC following prolonged liver injury via a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) dependent mechanism. As TNF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in inhibiting LPC activation and hepatocarcinogenesis. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme that mediates the production of many prostaglandins during inflammation and carcinogenesis. Recent investigations show that the administration of selective COX-2 inhibitors (SC2Is) may reduce the incidence of a variety of tumours including breast, colon and skin. The broad aim of this thesis was to conduct a series of detailed studies on the effects of a SC2I on LPC activation and the hepatic pathologies associated with hepatocarcinogenesis in order to test the hypothesis that S2CIs may be a beneficial therapy that can reduce liver injury and pre-neoplastic changes in the choline-deficient, ethionine supplemented (CDE) murine model of hepatocarcinogenesis. Administration of a SC2I (SC-236) significantly inhibited a variety of hepatic cell populations that expand during the first month of the CDE mouse model of hepatocarcinogenesis (a choline deficient, ethionine supplemented diet). Numbers of M2PK-positive LPCs (which are more hepatocytic in morphology and are also COX-2 positive) and inflammatory cells were all significantly reduced by SC-236. In contrast, numbers of A6-positive LPCs (which are more biliary cell-like in morphology and do not express COX-2) were unchanged. ... In summary, these data suggest that COX-2 inhibitors such as SC-236 inhibit LPC activation and a variety of pre-neoplastic liver pathologies as a result of COX-2 dependent and independent mechanisms that may be mediated through inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, SC2Is may be useful as preventative treatment strategies for HCC in patients with chronic liver disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyclooxygenase 2 -- Inhibitors -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Cancer -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Cancer -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">COX-2 inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Hepatic progenitor</field><field name="subject">Hepatocarcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">Oval cell</field><field name="subject">Liver cancer</field><field name="subject">Choline deficient ethionine supplemented (CDE) diet</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological and neuropsychological assessment of automatic and controlled processing aspects of attention after mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Jeffrey Michael</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Controlled and automatic processing are broad categories, and how best to measure these constructs and their impact on functioning after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains uncertain. The purpose of this thesis was to examine automatic and controlled processing aspects of attention after mild TBI using the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) and event-related potentials (ERPs). The PASAT is one of the most frequently used tests to evaluate attentional functioning. It has been demonstrated to be a measure sensitive to both acute and longer-term effects of mild TBI, presumably due to demands for rapid processing and executive attentional control. ERPs provide a noninvasive neurophysiological index of sensory processing and cognitive functions and have demonstrated sensitivity to even minor cognitive dysfunction. The parameters provided by this functional technique may be those most likely to distinguish individuals with mild TBI from controls. Initially, it was hypothesized that successful novice PASAT performance requires the engagement of executive attention to establish novel controlled information processing strategies. Ten individuals who had suffered a mild TBI an average of 15.20 months previously were therefore expected to demonstrate processing abnormalities on the PASAT, relative to 10 healthy matched controls. Although the mild TBI group reported significant intensification of subjective symptoms since their injury, compared to controls, the mild TBI group provided a similar amount of correct PASAT responses. ... In the first experiment a visual search task consisting of an automatic detection and a controlled search condition was developed. In the second experiment the search task was performed concurrently with the PASAT task in a dual-task paradigm. In the mild TBI group, prior failure to establish more efficient forms of information processing with practice was found to significantly interfere with simultaneous performance of the PASAT task and the attention demanding condition of the search task. The pattern of impaired performance was considered to reflect a reduction in processing resources rather than a deficit in resource allocation. Dual-task performance in the control group was not associated with a large interference effect. In general, the results of this thesis suggest that individuals with mild TBI are impaired in their ability to progress from the stage of effortful controlled information processing to a stage of more efficient, automatic processing, and thus suffer a subtle attentional deficit. Following mild TBI, performance levels equivalent to controls may only be achieved with an abnormal expenditure of cognitive effort. As a result of the neuropathologic consequences of injury, individuals who have sustained a mild TBI are less able to benefit from practice, experience difficulty coping with simultaneous performance of secondary task, and are susceptible to distressing subjective symptomatology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Attention -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Brain damage -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Wounds and injuries -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task</field><field name="subject">Mild TBI</field><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="subject">PASAT</field><field name="subject">ERPs</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of hair on human sound localisation cues</field><field name="creator">Treeby, Bradley E.</field><field name="description">The acoustic scattering properties of the human head and torso match well with those of simple geometric shapes. Consequently, analytical scattering models can be utilised to account for the sound localisation cues introduced by these features. The traditional use of such models assumes that the head surface is completely rigid in nature. This thesis is concerned with modelling and understanding the effect of terminal scalp hair (i.e., a non-rigid head surface) on the auditory localisation cues. The head is modelled as a sphere, and the acoustical characteristics of hair are modelled using a locally-reactive equivalent impedance parameter. This allows the scattering boundary to be defined on the inner rigid surface of the head. The boundary assumptions are validated experimentally, through impedance measurement at oblique incidence and analysis of the near-field scattering pattern of a uniformly covered sphere. The impedance properties of human hair are also discussed, including trends with variations in sample thickness, bulk density, and fibre diameter. A general solution for the scattering of sound by a sphere with an arbitrarily distributed, locally reactive surface impedance is then presented. From this, an analytical solution is derived for a surface boundary that is evenly divided into two uniformly distributed hemispheres. For this boundary condition, cross-coupling is shown to exist between incoming and scattered wave modes of equi-order when the degrees are non-equal and opposite in parity. The overall effect of impedance on the resultant scattering characteristics is discussed in detail, both for uniform and for hemispherically divided surface boundaries. Finally, the analytical formulation and the impedance characteristics of hair are collectively utilised to investigate the effect of hair on human auditory localisation cues. The hair is shown to produce asymmetric perturbations to both the monaural and binaural cues. These asymmetries may help to resolve localisation confusions between sound stimuli positioned in the front and rear hemi-fields. The cue changes in the azimuth plane are characterised by two predominant features and remain consistent regardless of the decomposition baseline (i.e., the inclusion of a pinna offset, neck, etc). Experimental comparisons using a synthetic hair material show a good agreement with simulated results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hair</field><field name="subject">Sound waves -- Scattering</field><field name="subject">Sound waves -- Scattering -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Hearing</field><field name="subject">Acoustic scattering</field><field name="subject">Binaural synthesis</field><field name="subject">Spherical head model</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust-based routing in pure ad-hoc wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Pirzada, Asad Amir</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An ad-hoc network of wireless nodes is a temporarily formed network, created, operated and managed by the nodes themselves. Due to its peculiar establishment and operational properties it is also often termed an infrastructure-less, self-organised, or spontaneous network. In order to extend the communication range of the nodes, beyond a single hop, specially configured routing protocols are used. The unique feature of these protocols is their ability to form routes in spite of a dynamic topology. For effective functioning of the network it is essential that the network nodes execute the routing protocols in a truthful manner regardless of their contemporary commitments and workload. In real life, this is more than often extremely difficult to realise, and so we often find malicious nodes also present in the same network. These nodes can either join externally or may originate internally by compromis- ing an existing benevolent node in the network. These malicious nodes can carry out an array of attacks against the routing protocols leading to route severing, unavailability of service or deception. A number of secure routing protocols, which make use of cryptographic algorithms to secure the routes, have recently been proposed. ... In order to sustain the improvised nature of ad-hoc networks, in this thesis, we have moved from the common mechanism of achieving trust via security to enforcing dependability through collaboration. We desist from the customary strategy of employing cryptography and instead use a trust model that is influ- enced by the human behavioural model. All nodes in the network independently execute this trust model and maintain their own assessment concerning other nodes in the network. Each node, based upon its individual experiences, rewards collabo- rating nodes for their benevolent behaviour and penalises malicious nodes for their malevolent conduct. To highlight the efficacy of this unique approach, we apply the trust model to three contemporary reactive routing protocols in a pure ad-hoc network. These trust reinforced routing protocols locate dependable routes in the network by observing the sincerity in participation of other nodes using a set of trust categories. The routes worked out in this way are neither protected in terms of security nor minimal in terms of hops. However, these routes traverse nodes, which have been identified as more trustworthy than others and for this reason are more dependable in extemporised circumstances. Through the help of extensive simulations, we have demonstrated that the usage of these protocols significantly improves the overall performance of the network even in the presence of a high percentage of malicious nodes. These protocols, being independent of a trust infrastructure, also enable rapid deployment and improved operation with dynamic adaptation to the current scenario. The prime advantage being gained is the ability to seamlessly integrate ad-hoc wireless networks belonging to dissimilar organisations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Routing (Computer network management)</field><field name="subject">Ad hoc networks (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Public key infrastructure (Computer security)</field><field name="subject">Trust security</field><field name="subject">Mobile</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting perceptions of efficacy in semi-professional soccer</field><field name="creator">Damato, Gregory C</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Collective efficacy (CE) has been consistently shown to contribute to team performance by improving motivation, perseverance, group goals, and expectancy in teams (Bandura, 2000; Feltz &amp; Lirgg, 2001). Having high confidence in one's team is proposed to increase the expectancy for success, thereby increasing motivation, persistence and effort, which in turn, increases overall performance (Bandura, 1997). A series of studies were conducted to examine predictors of self and collective efficacy in semi-professional soccer. In addition, within two of these studies, the effect of pivotal hypothetical injuries on players' and coaches' perceptions of CE were also examined. In the first and second studies, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized in order to examine simultaneous player and team level predictors of efficacy perceptions. Data were obtained from semi-professional male soccer players (N = 139, mean age = 23, SD = 4.43 yrs) from nine teams in Western Australia. Participants completed the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ), the revised Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2 (PMCSQ-2) as well as measures of self-talk, self-efficacy (SE), and CE created for this study. HLM analyses indicated CE was significantly and positively associated with SE and significantly and negatively associated with perceptions of a performance-oriented motivational climate. Significant positive associations of SE were positive self-talk and average number of minutes played each game. Negative correlates of SE were a performance-oriented motivational climate and number of years played. The results illustrate the important cross-level influences of player and team level variables on SE and CE perceptions. Overall, the findings provide support for the propositions of the influence of sources of efficacy information and broaden the existing work on efficacy and motivational climate in sport. ... Future research on team processes following injury that may moderate the injury efficacy relationship may include, the effect of team leaders in an attempt to motivate the team and the verbal and non-verbal strategies of coaches. The present studies contribute to the existing body of knowledge concerning efficacy theory. Specifically, within this series of studies, individual and team level predictors of SE and CE among elite sport participants were examined. A performance-oriented motivational climate was negatively associated with CE perceptions, while players with elevated levels of SE had teams with elevated levels of CE. SE was positively associated with positive self-talk, and negatively correlated with a performance-oriented motivational climate. Further, the effects of player injury on CE perceptions also represent a valuable contribution to efficacy theory. Prior to the current studies, no researchers have studied the influence of athlete absence due to injury on CE.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Soccer -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Teamwork (Sports) -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Achievement motivation</field><field name="subject">Collective efficacy</field><field name="subject">Self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Semi-professional soccer</field><field name="subject">Cohesion</field><field name="subject">Multilevel analysis</field><field name="subject">Players injury</field><field name="subject">Motivational climate</field><field name="subject">Self-talk</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of glucocorticoids on placental growth and vascularisation</field><field name="creator">Hewitt, Damien Phillip</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Glucocorticoids are critical for the maturation of the fetus late in pregnancy. Indeed, clinical administration of glucocorticoids is used to accelerate fetal lung maturation in mothers at risk of pre-term delivery. Increased glucocorticoid exposure, however, can have detrimental effects on fetal and placental growth and increase the risk of disease in later life. Many studies have focused on the effect of an increase in the transplacental passage of glucocorticoids on both fetal growth and subsequent postnatal development. But there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the impact of glucocorticoids on fetal growth is mediated, in part, via their direct effects on the placenta . . . Overall, these studies quantify the labyrinth zone-specific increases in placental expression of PPARG and VEGF in association with a marked increase in vascularisation observed near term. Furthermore, this study demonstrates for the first time that these increases in gene expression are prevented by maternal dexamethasone treatment which also inhibits growth of the fetal capillary network. Elevated expression of SFRP4 in the regressing basal zone late in gestation and in both placental zones after dexamethasone-induced placental growth restriction is consistent with a role for SFRP4 in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of wnt signalling. Collectively, the data presented in this thesis show that glucocorticoid inhibition of fetal growth is mediated in large part via effects on the placenta, specifically through inhibition of signals that promote proliferation and vascularisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maternal-fetal exchange</field><field name="subject">Placenta</field><field name="subject">Obstetrical pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Prenatal influences</field><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids -- Therapeutic use -- Side effects</field><field name="subject">Placenta</field><field name="subject">Stereology</field><field name="subject">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</field><field name="subject">Secreted frizzled-related protein 4</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Singapore stories - language and class in Singapore : an investigation into the socio-economic implications of English literacy as a life chance among the Chinese of Singapore from 1945 to 2000</field><field name="creator">Koh, Ernest Wee Song</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the socio-economic effects of English literacy among the Chinese of Singapore between 1945 and 2000. Through the use of oral history, statistical evidence, and existing secondary literature on the conditions of everyday life in Singapore, it explores how English literacy as a life chance has played a key role in shaping the class structures that exist among the Chinese in Singapore today. Adopting a 'perspective from below', this study provides a historical account that surveys the experiences of everyday life in Singapore through the stories of everyday life. It seeks to present an account that more accurately reflects the nation's nuanced past through defining eras in Singapore's post-war history  'Singapore Stories' in the plural, as opposed to the singular. Viewing the impact of English literacy through the prism of Max Weber's concept of life chances allows an examination of the opportunities in the lives of the interviewees cited within by distinguishing between negotiated and corralled life chances. The overarching argument made by this study is that in the later stages of Singapore's postwar history and development, English literacy was a critical factor that allowed individuals to negotiate key opportunities in life, thus increasing the likelihood of socioeconomic mobility. For those without English literacy, the range of possibilities in life became increasingly restricted, corralling individuals into a less affluent economic state. While acknowledging the significance of structural forces, and in particular the shaping influence of industrialisation, economic policy, and social engineering, this study also demonstrates how regarding the Singapore Chinese as possessing a variety of distinguishing social and economic characteristics, all of which serve to segment the community as an ethnic group, adds a new and critical dimension to our academic understanding of the nation's social past and present. By locating areas of resistance and the development of life strategies by an individual or household, this thesis illustrates how language, literacy, and class operated within the reality of undefined and multilayered historical spaces among the Chinese of Singapore.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese -- Singapore -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Social classes -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Speech and social status -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">English language -- Social aspects -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Language</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Social stratification</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of asset-pricing models in Australia</field><field name="creator">Limkriangkrai, Manapon</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines competing asset-pricing models in Australia with the goal of establishing the model which best explains cross-sectional stock returns. The research employs Australian equity data over the period 1980-2001, with the major analyses covering the more recent period 1990-2001. The study first documents that existing asset-pricing models  namely the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and domestic Fama-French three-factor model fail to meet the widely applied Merton?s zero-intercept criterion for a well-specified pricing model. This study instead documents that the US three-factor model provides the best description of Australian stock returns. The three US Fama-French factors are statistically significant for the majority of portfolios consisting of large stocks. However, no significant coefficients are found for portfolios in the smallest size quintile. This result initially suggests that the largest firms in the Australian market are globally integrated with the US market while the smallest firms are not. Therefore, the evidence at this point implies domestic segmentation in the Australian market. This is an unsatisfying outcome, considering that the goal of this research is to establish the pricing model that best describes portfolio returns. Given pervasive evidence that liquidity is strongly related to stock returns, the second part of the major analyses derives and incorporates this potentially priced factor to the specified pricing models ...  This study also introduces a methodology for individual security analysis, which implements the portfolio analysis, in this part of analyses. The technique makes use of visual impressions conveyed by the histogram plots of coefficients' p-values. A statistically significant coefficient will have its p-values concentrated at below a 5% level of significance; a histogram of p-values will not have a uniform distribution ...  The final stage of this study employs daily return data as an examination of what is indeed the best pricing model as well as to provide a robustness check on monthly return results. The daily result indicates that all three US Fama-French factors, namely the US market, size and book-to-market factors as well as LIQT are statistically significant, while the Australian three-factor model only exhibits one significant market factor. This study has discovered that it is in fact the US three-factor model with LIQT and not the domestic model, which qualifies for the criterion of a well-specified asset-pricing model and that it best describes Australian stock returns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investments -- Australia -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Finance -- Australia -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Capital assets pricing model</field><field name="subject">Assets (Accounting) -- Prices -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Portfolio management -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Asset pricing</field><field name="subject">International integration</field><field name="subject">Three-factor model</field><field name="subject">Liquidity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An NMR investigation of pore size and paramagnetic effects in synthetic sandstones</field><field name="creator">Ronan, Leah L</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis describes the development of synthetic rock samples, representative of core samples from hydrocarbon reservoirs. The basic process consists of screening and sorting silica particles into discrete grain sizes, and then binding them together using a proprietary process known as CIPS, (Calcite In-situ Precipitation System). In the bonding process, the porosity of the system is substantially preserved, and the technique allows the manufacture of synthetic core samples with a tailor-made permeability. The produced samples were extensively characterised using a variety of analytic techniques to determine their porosity, permeability and pore size distribution. These analyses were a necessary pre-cursor to a major part of this thesis: the characterisation of the pore space by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The synthetic core samples, covering a 7 times factor in grain sizes were examined using NMR, and this data formed the comparative basis for the NMR studies that followed.  Two fundamental NMR questions were posed and answered in this thesis:  1. What is the effect of paramagnetic ions in the rock matrix on the NMR response? In pursuit of this question the CIPS process was extended to include co-precipitation of paramagnetic ions. A key feature is that the ions were deposited in predictable amounts at known sites (on the wall of the pore space). ... The NMR response in these double cores was then measured and examined to provide an answer to the question posed at the beginning of this paragraph. The significance of this work is that the physically distinct cores are a cylindrical analogue of adjoining sedimentary strata. By answering the question posed above, the thesis gives an indication of the vertical porosity resolution ultimately possible in an NMR logging tool. At present this ranges from 9&#8221; to 24&#8221; in the most favourable circumstances. This work suggests that the NMR signal carries porosity information at a much higher resolution, and that advanced numerical analysis of the NMR signature could realise the potential of greater stratigraphic resolution in NMR logging  In addition to the research outlined above, the application of the CIPS technique to produce analogues of reservoir rocks, pioneered in this thesis, has stimulated similar research to be undertaken at other institutions, including   the fabrication of synthetic reservoir cores containing clay particles (at CSIRO - the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) and   a large scale application, formation of meter size blocks of CIPS bonded material, with separate strata, for laboratory studies of seismic waves (at Curtin University)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sandstone</field><field name="subject">Nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">Porosity</field><field name="subject">Rocks -- Permeability</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbon reservoirs</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="subject">Paramagnetic</field><field name="subject">Nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">Synthetic sandstones</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mandatory detention for asylum seekers in Australia : an evaluation of liberal criticism</field><field name="creator">Davies, Evan</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates the policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers maintained by successive Australian governments against several core liberal principles. These principles are derived from various accounts of liberal political thought and the major themes and criticisms inherent in the public debate over the policy. The justifications of the policy given by the Australian government and the criticisms enunciated by scholars, refugee advocates and non-government organisations with respect to the policy strongly correspond with the core liberal principles of fairness, protecting the rights of the individual, accountability and proportionality. The claims of the critics converge on a central point of contention: that the mandatory detention of asylum seekers violates core liberal principles. To ascertain the extent to which the claims of the critics can be supported, the thesis selectively draws on liberal political theory to provide a framework for the analysis of the policy against these liberal principles, a basis for inquiry largely neglected by contributors to the literature. This thesis argues that, on balance, the mandatory detention policy employed by successive Australian governments violates core liberal principles. The claims of the critics are weakened, but by no means discredited, by the importance of the government's maintenance of strong border control. In the main, however, criticisms made by opponents of the policy can be supported. This thesis contributes to the substantial body of literature on the mandatory detention policy by shedding light on how liberal principles may be applicable to the mandatory detention policy. Further, it aims to contribute to an enriched understanding of the Australian government's competence to detain asylum seekers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asylum, Right of -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Liberalism -- Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Refugees -- Government policy -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Detention of persons -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Alien detention centers -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Detention</field><field name="subject">Asylum seekers</field><field name="subject">Liberal political theory</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chondrocyte : a target for the treatment of osteoarthritis</field><field name="creator">Lin, Zhen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, characterized by progressively degeneration of articular cartilage. Chondrocyte is the only cell type in articular cartilage tissue and responsible for cartilage matrix turnover. This thesis focuses on the biological and genetic behaviors of human chondrocyte and potential therapeutic strategies that target on chondrocyte. Chondrocytes have been used for the tissue-engineered cartilage construction, especially in articular cartilage repair. The technique of chondrocyte-base tissue engineering utilizes in vitro propagated chondrocytes combined with several manufactured biomaterials to regenerate cartilage tissue. Although these technologies have been successfully applied in clinic, the biological characteristics of chondrocyte during in vitro propagation and after implantation remain unclear. This thesis reviewed the present studies of chondrocyte biology and its potential uses in tissue engineering. Particularly, chondrocytes have been shown to de-differentiate into fibroblastic-cells when they are exposed to inflammatory conditions or cultured on monolayer in vitro. This thesis investigated the gene expression profile of chondrocytes when they are cultured and serially passaged on monolayer in vitro. Human chondrocytes obtained from OA patients were cultured up to passage 6. Twenty-eight chondrocyte associated genes were measured by Real-time PCR. The results showed that a number of genes were changed in expression levels at various stages of passage as indications of chondrocyte de-differentiation. Chondrocytes derived from OA patients or normal donors exhibited a very similar gene expression pattern. Interestingly, transcription factor Sox-9, which plays a key role in chondrogenesis remained unchanged with increasing passage number, indicating that the de-differentiation process of chondrocyte is reversible. This thesis also focused on the development of novel pharmacological approaches for OA that target on articular chondrocyte. The clinical feature, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approaches, conventional and potential future treatments for OA were briefly reviewed in this thesis. ... The effects of natural compounds on chondrocyte gene expression, proteoglycan degradation and nitric oxide production were measured. The results showed that parthenolide, a NF-kB inhibitor, regulated chondrocyte function by suppressing the up-regulation of gene expression of inflammatory factors and matrix proteinases induced by lipopolysaccharide, and down-regulating COX-2 expression. Parthenolide was able to reduce proteoglycan degradation in human chondrocytes, but had no effect on nitric oxide production. These results suggest that parthenolide mediates inflammatory-activated NF-kB pathway, and subsequently reduces inflammatory response, prevents cartilage destruction and relieves pain, and hence may be useful for OA treatment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Cartilage -- Wounds and injuries -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Cartilage cells</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">Chondrocyte</field><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Osteoarthritis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Western Australian register of multiple births : a twin-family study of asthma</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Janice</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background: Genetic epidemiology draws on the mechanisms of heredity and the reproductive characteristics of populations to formulate methods to investigate the role of genetic factors and their interaction with the environment in disease aetiology. Asthma and atopy are complex genetic disorders and are among the most common diseases to affect the developed world. Twin studies provide an elegant means of disentangling genetic and environmental contributions to the aetiology of conditions that have a significant impact on the health of the general population in ways that cannot be achieved by any other study design, by comparing disease frequency in monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins, who share 100% of their genes with that in dizygotic (DZ) or non-identical twins who share, on average, 50% of their genes. Twin-family studies allow the complete partitioning of phenotypic variation into components representing additive genetic, dominance, shared environment and non-shared environment. ... For twin family data, the best fitting model was the one which included additive genetic effects and either genetic dominance or shared sibling environment, and that shared family environment was not important. With respect to asthma in WA twin families, there are no reasons to conclude that the EEA is not valid. Conclusions: The WA Twin Register is the first population-based register of childhood multiples to be established in Australia, and the WATCH study is one of only a few population-based twin-family studies in the world. Families who participated in the WATCH study were no different from non-participants with respect to social class and there was no difference in the prevalence of DDA in WATCH study twins and either their singleton siblings or the general population of WA children. Results from the GEE models replicate those found in numerous studies from many different countries. The BUGS models developed have been shown to produce consistent results with both simulated and real data sets and offer alternative methods of analyzing twin and twin-family data. By including an extra term in the partitioning of the variance to account for the environment effect of being a MZ twin, a numerical value is calculated for the difference in MZ and DZ correlation with respect to the phenotype examined, which allows the validity of the EEA to be directly assessed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma -- Western Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Asthma -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Registers of births, etc. -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Diseases in twins -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia -- Registers</field><field name="subject">Genetic epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Twin register</field><field name="subject">Bayesian analysis</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The personal information management behaviour of academics : implications for librarians' support</field><field name="creator">Newton-Smith, Carol Jean</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to better understand how academics manage their personal information and therefore to have a basis for planning for appropriate support by librarians. There did not appear to be any current relevant research but from a review of previous studies, in which the predominant management strategy included a card personal index, a model was drawn up and validated by a number of academics would be using electronic personal indexes to manage their personal collections. The research methods selected for this study were in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey. The main findings were that academics do not use a personal index (card or electronic) to manage their personal collections and they also use a language different from that of librarians to describe their activities of personal information management. Academics manage their information by organising their personal collection according to their working subject framework. to expand their collections they work outwards from items of known quality or follow the advice of colleagues to locate such items. To become aware of the new material in the library (or elsewhere), academics prefer to browse new journals and books, rather than use a subject index. Databases are used for confirmation of reference details and citation indexes are used to work outwards from documents of known quality. The output of references is by the use of word processing software with a few academics using bibliographic software just for this function. The conclusion of the study were that academics manage their personal information in a dissimilar way to that expected by librarians. Academics are managing ideas not documents and their methods of personal information management reflect the need to manage these ideas and the associated connective thought process. Librarians can better assist academics by designing library services that facilitate academics' ideas management. Suggestions for improved support include the development of services that enable browsing, the linking of ideas between research publications in different disciplines and the provision of a service to confirm reference details.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personal information management</field><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Australia -- Relations with faculty and curriculum</field><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Relations with faculty and curriculum</field><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Australia -- Information services</field><field name="subject">Academic libraries -- Information services</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Faculty -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Information technology -- Management</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of MCAM in melanoma and metastasis</field><field name="creator">Dye, Danielle E</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) is highly expressed in more than 70% of metastatic melanoma and is correlated with invasive potential. However, the specific contribution MCAM makes to invasion and metastasis in melanoma is not clear. In this study, I have demonstrated that transfection of MCAM into MCAM-negative melanoma and CHO cells leads to changes in cell shape, and the modulation of cell-to-cell and cell-matrix interactions. MCAM positive cells were slower to spread on collagen type I, collagen type IV and laminin 1 than MCAM negative cells, although these differences were not apparent on vitronectin, fibronectin and laminin 10. In contrast, MCAM expression had little effect on cell adhesion to any of the matrices tested. MCAM positive (compared to negative) cells also showed morphological changes and a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton when plated on a matrix containing laminin 5. Taken together, these data suggest that MCAM expression modulates &#946;1-integrinmediated spreading on matrix, but has little effect on &#945;v&#946;3-mediated cell-matrix interactions. As this study provided little evidence to suggest that MCAM transfection altered &#946;1 integrin expression levels on melanoma cells, it is proposed that a competitive interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of MCAM and &#946;1 integrin may affect mature focal adhesion assembly. MCAM expression in melanoma cells was also associated with decreased cell movement over matrix into a scratch-wound site and an increased tendency to form cell cords on Matrigel. These two assays gauge the propensity of a cell to engage in cell-cell versus cell-matrix interactions, and suggest that MCAM positive cells favour cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly, MCAM transfection was also associated with an increased ability of melanoma cells to migrate through a basement membrane towards a chemoattractant.  ...  Analysis of the intracellular domain of MCAM revealed the presence of tyrosine and dileucine endocytosis signals. Interestingly, disruption of these two motifs did not seem to impair the internalization of MCAM from the cell surface. The di-leucine motif, however, was necessary for the recycling of MCAM back to the surface following endocytosis. Lastly, MCAM was found to exists as dimers within the cell membrane in the absence of ligand, although the exact location of the dimerization motif is not yet clearly defined. Collectively, findings from my study suggest:  MCAM expression in melanoma cells facilitates cell-cell interactions, whilst concomitantly modulating cell-matrix interactions. MCAM transfection also leads to enhanced migration of melanoma cells through a basement membrane. Thus, MCAM expression may increase the ability of melanoma cells to migrate as a collective, a feature of highly invasive cancer.  The intracellular domain of MCAM interacts with ApxL2, a novel member of the Shroom family of actin-binding proteins. It is likely that ApxL2 links a proportion of MCAM within the cell to the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to cell shape determination and other processes, such as migration.  MCAM exists as dimers on the cell surface and is internalized at least partially by a clathrin-mediated mechanism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell interaction</field><field name="subject">Melanoma</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="subject">Skin -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Melanoma</field><field name="subject">Cell adhesion molecules</field><field name="subject">MCAM/CD146</field><field name="subject">Cell migration</field><field name="subject">Cell-matrix interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional physical and numerical modelling of jack-up structures on sand</field><field name="creator">Bienen, Britta</field><field name="description">Mobile offshore jack-up drilling rigs are not custom-designed for a particular location but rated for typical operating characteristics, like water depths.

Traditionally, these assessments have been performed in two dimensions, simplifying the jack-up to a plane frame and the loading conditions to be in-plane with the rig's 'axis of symmetry'. This thesis introduces a computer program, named SOS_3D, for the fluid-structure-soil interaction analysis of jack-up response in three dimensions. Extensive experimental series have been performed to provide evidence for the generalisation of the foundationsoil interaction model to general six degree-of-freedom loading conditions and its applicability to load paths and stress levels relevant to jack-up spudcans. These experiments included (1) 1g single footing tests, (2) centrifuge single footing tests and (3) centrifuge model jack-up tests. The latter tests highlighted differences in response and mode of failure depending on the loading direction of the jack-up and re-iterated the importance of three-dimensional modelling. The numerical program SOS_3D introduced early in this thesis was shown to represent a useful tool for the prediction of jack-up behaviour under general combined loading in three dimensions. It provided reasonably good, conservative predictions of the experimentally measured jack-up behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jackup rigs -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Engineering geology</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Sand -- Testing -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Shallow foundation</field><field name="subject">Fluid-structure-soil interaction</field><field name="subject">Numerical modelling and analysis</field><field name="subject">Combined loading</field><field name="subject">Physical modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors : Thomas Jefferson and the role of English history in the building of the American nation</field><field name="creator">Walker, Jessica Lorraine</field><field name="description">This thesis contends that Anglo-Saxon studies made a powerful contribution to Thomas Jefferson's development of public concepts of American identity and nationalism in ways that have been elided by scholars preoccupied with Jefferson's classicism. Jefferson's comprehensive survey of Anglo-Saxon grammar, language, law and emigration provided him with a precedent for revolution and helped him develop a model of American nationhood. Jefferson's detailed study of the Anglo-Saxon era set him apart from writers on both sides of the Atlantic in the period 1750-1860, and this thesis will argue that to generalize his interest as 'whig history' or a subscription to a theory of Teutonic superiority is unjustified. Chapter One considers Jefferson's educational background, his exposure to Anglo-Saxon history and the degree to which he might have been encouraged to pursue it. Previous studies of Jefferson's Anglo-Saxonism have presumed that there was a 'Gothic font' from which American Founding Fathers could drink; the detailed study of Anglo-Saxon historiography in this chapter will show otherwise. Chapter Two is concerned with a detailed examination of the collections of books relating to Anglo-Saxon history and language that Jefferson collected throughout his lifetime. If Jefferson was concerned with whig dialogues, or interested in the Saxons as a product of a passion for Tacitus we should find evidence of it here. In fact, the study of Jefferson's library in Chapter Two demonstrates that Jefferson was genuinely an expert Anglo-Saxon scholar and regarded that knowledge base as a political tool. Chapters Three and Four constitute detailed examinations of the nationalist use to which Jefferson put his understanding of early English history. Chapter Three considers the problem of shared heritage with Britain confronting the American statesman in the 1760s and 1770s and his employment of pre-Norman history in resolving this conflict. Chapter Four enlarges upon the study of American national identity, with specific reference to the linguistic debates following on the Revolution. This chapter revolves around a reconsideration of Jefferson's Anglo-Saxon Essay and his attempts to introduce this language into the education of future American statesmen. Jefferson's examination of Anglo-Saxon history, when considered in this light, seems oddly discordant with the simplistic notion of Jefferson as a founder of Teutonic superiority. Chapter Five is interested in Jefferson's impact on historical rhetoric in the nineteenth century. Thomas Jefferson used English history as an aid to separating an American nation from the British Empire and he believed that Americans could look to their Anglo-Saxon ancestors for a precedent that would justify their independence from Britain. He saw in Anglo-Saxon studies a means for appropriating those parts of English history that could underpin a national identity defined by freedom, initiative, and perhaps a racial predilection for democracy, while simultaneously rejecting Britain's authority in his present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jefferson, Thomas, -- 1743-1826</field><field name="subject">Anglo-Saxons -- England -- History</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- United States -- History</field><field name="subject">National characteristics, American -- History</field><field name="subject">United States -- History -- Colonial period, ca. 1600-1775</field><field name="subject">United States -- Politics and government -- To 1775</field><field name="subject">Thomas Jefferson</field><field name="subject">American nationalism</field><field name="subject">Early American republic</field><field name="subject">Early American education</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising evolutionary strategies for problems with varying noise strength</field><field name="creator">Di Pietro, Anthony</field><field name="description">For many real-world applications of evolutionary computation, the fitness function is obscured by random noise. This interferes with the evaluation and selection processes and adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. Noise can be effectively eliminated by averaging a large number of fitness samples for each candidate, but the number of samples used per candidate (the resampling rate) required to achieve this is usually prohibitively large and time-consuming. Hence there is a practical need for algorithms that handle noise without eliminating it. Moreover, the amount of noise (noise strength and distribution) may vary throughout the search space, further complicating matters. We study noisy problems for which the noise strength varies throughout the search space. Such problems have generally been ignored by previous work, which has instead generally focussed on the specific case where the noise strength is the same at all points in the search domain. However, this need not be the case, and indeed this assumption is false for many applications. For example, in games of chance such as Poker, some strategies may be more conservative than others and therefore less affected by the inherent noise of the game. This thesis makes three significant contributions in the field of noisy fitness functions:  We present the concept of dynamic resampling. Dynamic resampling is a technique that varies the resampling rate based on the noise strength and fitness for each candidate individually. This technique is designed to exploit the variation in noise strength and fitness to yield a more efficient algorithm. We present several dynamic resampling algorithms and give results that show that dynamic resampling can perform significantly better than the standard resampling technique that is usually used by the optimisation community, and that dynamic resampling algorithms that vary their resampling rates based on both noise strength and fitness can perform better than algorithms that vary their resampling rate based on only one of the above.  We study a specific class of noisy fitness functions for which we counterintuitively find that it is better to use a higher resampling rate in regions of lower noise strength, and vice versa. We investigate how the evolutionary search operates on such problems, explain why this is the case, and present a hypothesis (with supporting evidence) for classifying such problems.  We present an adaptive engine that automatically tunes the noise compensation parameters of the search during the run, thereby eliminating the need for the user to choose these parameters ahead of time. This means that our techniques can be readily applied to real-world problems without requiring the user to have specialised domain knowledge of the problem that they wish to solve. These three major contributions present a significant addition to the body of knowledge for noisy fitness functions. Indeed, this thesis is the first work specifically to examine the implications of noise strength that varies throughout the search domain for a variety of noise landscapes, and thus starts to fill a large void in the literature on noisy fitness functions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary programming (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Noisy fitness function</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary strategy</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Noise landscape</field><field name="subject">Dynamic resampling</field><field name="subject">Adaptive dynamic resampling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling multi-directional behaviour of piles using energy principles</field><field name="creator">Levy, Nina Hannah</field><field name="description">The loads applied to pile foundations installed offshore vary greatly from those encountered onshore, with more substantial lateral and torsional loads. For combined axial and lateral loading the current design practice involves applying an axial load to a deep foundation and assessing the pile behaviour and then considering a lateral load separately. For the problem of an altering directions of lateral loads (e.g. due to changes in the wind directions acting on offshore wind turbines) a clear design procedure is not available. There is thus a need for a clearly established methodology to effectively introduce the interaction between the four different loading directions (two lateral, one axial and one torsional). In this thesis, a model is presented that introduces a series of Winkler elasto-plastic elements coupled between the different directions via local interaction yield surfaces along the pile. The energy based method that is used allows the soil-pile system to be defined explicitly using two equations: the energy potential and the dissipation potential. One of the most interesting applications of this model is to piles subjected to a change in lateral loading direction, where the loading history can significantly influence the pile behaviour. This effect was verified by a series of experimental tests, undertaken using the Geotechnical Centrifuge at UWA. The same theory was then applied to cyclic loading in two dimensions, leading to some very useful conclusions regarding shakedown behaviour. A theoretically based relationship was applied to the local yielding behaviour for a pile subjected to a combination of lateral and axial loading, allowing predictions to be made of the influence of load inclination on the pile behaviour. The ability of this model to represent interaction between four degrees of freedom allows a more realistic approach to be taken to this problem than that considered in current design practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Piling (Civil engineering) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Engineering geology</field><field name="subject">Axial loads</field><field name="subject">Lateral loads</field><field name="subject">Piles</field><field name="subject">Axial loading</field><field name="subject">Lateral loading</field><field name="subject">Geotechnical engineering</field><field name="subject">Combined loading</field><field name="subject">Shakedown</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-shelf coral reef biodiversity : does data and ecological theory fit with habitat-based species conservation models?</field><field name="creator">Radford, Benedict</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Selection of priority areas for Marine Park conservation is often compromised by the lack of comprehensive biodiversity data and the resources and expertise necessary to gain this information directly by sampling. One cost effective alternative is the use of species groups or indicator species as surrogates for total biodiversity. However use of these surrogates requires an ecological understanding of how they reflect biodiversity gradients. A framework for unravelling these relationships has been suggested that involves relating species biodiversity to different and competing ecological models using appropriate statistical analysis. I use this framework to explore coral species biodiversity over a range of environmental gradients encompassing the North West Shelf of Australia and the Great Barrier Reef in North East Australia. ... I assessed physiological responses of corals to physical factors to corroborate crossshelf patterns in species biodiversity. Finally, I investigated to what extent coral cooccurrence based species groups (or guilds) can be used as surrogates for total coral biodiversity. The major findings of this thesis were: i) coral biodiversity along cross-shelf environments was highly correlated to specific gradients of abiotic reef conditions; ii) larval modelling indicates the potential for significant connectivity across continentalshelf environments such that differences in species distribution are not simply as a result of self seeding. iii) similar correlative patterns were demonstrated for coral species that occur along comparable abiotic gradients in reef areas of both Eastern and Western Australia, suggesting a causal relationship between the physical environment and coral biodiversity; iv) coral physiological parameters measured using lipid fractions independently corroborated the hypothesis that there is a biological basis for observed coral distributions; v) reef coral communities are not highly structured across abiotic physical gradients and biodiversity across the shelf increases as conditions become suitable for a wider range of species; vi) total coral biodiversity can be estimated very accurately (within r2 values ranging from 0.75 to 0.90) using a small number (15-30) of optimally chosen indictor species using the randomForest statistical method.

The first stream concerned extending the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to predict youth's behavioural intentions to stay loyal to mobile service providers. Drawing on selfcategorisation theory, a conceptual model extended TPB by replacing subjective norm with group norm, a social influence from behaviourally relevant peers. With the extended TPB as the theoretical framework, the second stream investigated determinants of mobile loyalty intentions. Common to both streams, a key contribution of this dissertation was how hedonic consumption moderated the relationships among mobile loyalty intentions and their determinants. The dissertation addressed five questions in the two research streams, which to the author's knowledge no published studies have explored. Using a triangulation approach to address the research questions, a qualitative survey and literature review yielded six determinants of mobile loyalty intentions. Next, a pretest led to an improved questionnaire before a large-scale survey gathered data for empirical testing. The survey took place with Singaporean youth and yielded a cleaned sample of n = 415. ... For both low and high hedonic consumptions, customer value was insignificant. This might be due to Singapore's competitive mobile service market; youth perceived little differences in value for money among competing mobile service providers. Testing alternative models offered further insights into youth's mobile loyalty intentions. Youth's mobile loyalty behaviour, operationalised as past switching, was not stochastic, suggesting that mobile loyalty intentions contained underlying determinants. Brand trust, salient in other contexts, did not apply to mobile loyalty intentions perhaps because youth perceived little risk in switching mobile service providers in developed markets. An attitude-group norm interaction also did not relate to mobile loyalty intentions, supporting TPB's construct independence and parsimony. Finally, attitude and customer satisfaction were operationally similar in that they related to mobile loyalty intentions similarly. The dissertation concluded by offering academic and managerial implications and contributions, limitations, and future research areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Young adult consumers</field><field name="subject">Youth -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Behaviorism (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Customery loyalty</field><field name="subject">Hedonic consumption</field><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">Moderating influence</field><field name="subject">Mobile phones</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substituted cage amines : towards new functional metalloassemblies</field><field name="creator">Nealon, Gareth L.</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 contains an Introduction to the role of metal complexes in functional assemblies.

Accessing and using databases is no longer a specialized activity as more and more ordinary users without any specialized knowledge are trying to gain information from databases. Both expert and ordinary users face significant challenges in understanding the information stored in databases. The databases are so large in most cases that it is impossible to gain useful information by inspecting data tables, which are the most common form of storing data in relational databases. Visualization has emerged as one of the most important techniques for exploring data stored in large databases. Appropriate visualization techniques can reveal trends, correlations and associations in data that are very difficult to understand from a textual representation of the data. This thesis presents several new frameworks for data visualization and visual data mining. The first technique, VisEx, is useful for visual exploration of large multi-attribute datasets and especially for exploring the correlations among the attributes in such datasets. Most previous visualization techniques can display correlations among two or three attributes at a time without excessive screen clutter. ... Although many algorithms for mining association rules have been researched extensively, they do not incorporate users in the process and most of them generate a large number of association rules. It is quite often difficult for the user to analyze a large number of rules to identify a small subset of rules that is of importance to the user. In this thesis I present a framework for the user to interactively mine association rules visually. Another challenging task in data mining is to understand the correlations among the mined association rules. It is often difficult to identify a relevant subset of association rules from a large number of mined rules. A further contribution of this thesis is a simple framework in the VisAR system that allows the user to explore a large number of association rules visually. A variety of businesses have adopted new technologies for storing large amounts of data. Analysis of historical data quite often offers new insights into business processes that may increase productivity and profit. On-line analytical processing (OLAP) has become a powerful tool for business analysts to explore historical data. Effective visualization techniques are very important for supporting OLAP technology. A new technique for the visual exploration of OLAP data cubes is also presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information visualization</field><field name="subject">Database management</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Information visualization</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Online analytical processing</field><field name="subject">Visual data mining</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of retrospectively examined early psychosocial stress on mate choice and sexual behaviour : a life history theory perspective</field><field name="creator">Koehler, Nicole</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Early psychosocial stress is conjectured to place individuals on a developmental trajectory leading to earlier pubertal maturation, earlier initiation of sexual activity and earlier reproduction than those with less early psychosocial stress. This may have an adaptive function to minimise the chances of lineage extinction, which is more likely in environments of high risk and uncertainty. Previous studies have examined the relationship between early psychosocial stress and life history stages (e.g., age at puberty, age at first sex and age at first birth). However, these studies are limited in that they either examined only a few early psychosocial stressors, examined psychosocial stress relatively late in individuals' lives and/or were restricted to women. Thus, the first aim of the present thesis was to examine these findings in both genders using a measure of early psychosocial stress comprised of 24 categories of retrospectively assessed stressors (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, parental divorce, rated quality of family life) during the first 7 years of life. It was hypothesised that individuals with high, as opposed to low, levels of early psychosocial stress would pass through life history stages earlier. The second aim was to examine how early psychosocial stress affects characteristics associated with life history traits, such as individuals? length, number and type of heterosexual relationships, number of sex partners, adult attachment styles, number of pregnancy terminations, and attitudes and behaviours towards contraceptive use. High levels of early psychosocial stress were predicted to be associated with characteristics reflecting a quantitative, as opposed to a qualitative, reproductive approach (e.g., more sex partners, more short-term relationships, insecure attachment styles). The third aim was to examine how early psychosocial stress is related to mate choice because numerous studies have identified what traits individuals' desire in a mate but not whether early psychosocial stress affects these choices. ... Early psychosocial stress generally had no effects on age at first sex, age at first birth, the number of pregnancy terminations, and mate choices. On the other hand, individuals with high, as opposed to low, levels of early psychosocial stress were more likely to be insecurely attached, had more short-term sexual relationships (men only), had more extra-pair copulations, were more likely to be divorced/separated, had a greater lifetime number of sex partners (men only), and had lower self-rated frequencies of contraception use. Overall, some of these findings are consistent with life history theory, which suggests that individuals with high levels of early psychosocial stress (i.e., those living in environments of high risk and uncertainty) should reach biological maturation earlier, engage in behaviours that facilitate earlier and more frequent reproduction to minimise the chances of lineage extinction. Implications for public health, limitations of the present study and future directions are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mate selection</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stress in children</field><field name="subject">Child psychopathology -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Life cycle, Human</field><field name="subject">Maturation (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Developmental psychology</field><field name="subject">Early psychosocial stress</field><field name="subject">Life history theory</field><field name="subject">Menarche/spermarche</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Sex</field><field name="subject">Mate choice</field><field name="subject">Contraception</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of environmental staining and storage on discolouration and cooking quality in Faba bean (Vicia faba L.)</field><field name="creator">Nasar-Abbas, Syed Muhammad</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Faba bean (Vicia Faba L.) ranks third worldwide in overall production among coolseason legume crops and is used as a main source of protein both for food and feed purposes in many parts of the world. Australia is a major exporter of faba beans and the price received depends on the quality of the seed especially colour of the seed coat. Consumers don?t like faba beans that are dark coloured or that have blemishes on the seed coat. Environmental staining and storage discolouration deteriorate seed colour causing substantial economic losses to growers and grain handlers. To investigate the influence of environmental conditions, especially during pod/seed development and maturity, on the degree of environmental staining, field trials were conducted using four faba bean varieties (Fiord, Fiesta, Ascot and Cairo) in a range of environmental conditions under the Mediterranean-type climate of south western Australian grain belt. Although a majority of seeds had good colour but 3-25% were stained up to an unacceptable level across the trials and this varied with location and variety. Seeds formed later in plant development (located on the upper nodes of the plant) were more stained than seeds formed earlier (located on the lower nodes). This may be due to end of season environmental factors, such as high temperature and light intensity, and water and nutrient stress. Similarly seeds formed on small and weak plants, which may have developed under stressful conditions, had more staining than seeds formed on normal sized and healthy plants. Genotypic variation was also evident with Fiord showing greater staining than Ascot, Fiesta and Cairo. The cause of environmental staining appears to be complex but was associated with phenolic contents. Storage discolouration was influenced by a number of factors including temperature, seed moisture content, light and storage period and these were critical in determining storage life. ... Faba bean hardness, examined by the hard-to-cook test, also increased with increased storage temperature. There was a high negative correlation (r2 = 0.98) between storage temperature and cooking ability of faba bean. There was a three-fold increase in lignin content of faba bean stored at 50&#176;C compared to those stored at 5&#176;C and it was correlated with bean hardness (r2 = 0.98). Reduction in free phenolics was negatively correlated (r2 = 0.75) with bean hardness. The environmental staining in faba bean can be minimized with correct choice of varieties, robust agronomic practices to establish and maintain healthy plants and the use of mechanical graders and colour sorters. For minimizing storage discolouration faba beans must be dehydrated to &#8804;12% seed moisture content and stored in insulated bins (silos) or at least bins painted white and constructed under trees shades. In addition occasional flushing with N2 will further help reduce the colour darkening. The above approaches will improve quality, market opportunities, price and hence profitability of faba bean in the farming systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cookery (Legumes)</field><field name="subject">Fava bean -- Quality</field><field name="subject">Fava bean -- Storage</field><field name="subject">Legumes -- Seeds -- Quality</field><field name="subject">Legumes -- Storage</field><field name="subject">Legumes</field><field name="subject">Seed discolouration</field><field name="subject">Physicochemical changes</field><field name="subject">Phenolics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer perspectives of recovery from the effects of a severe mental illness : a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Anthony Roy</field><field name="description">Interest in the ability of people to recover from a severe mental illness has a long history. During the 1980s, however, there was a paradigm shift away research driven by clinicians immersed in the quantitative, objective microcosm of anatomy and physiology towards understanding recovery from a consumer perspective. Even so the experiences of consumers has remained relatively unexplored, with the lion's share of research emanating from the United States of America. At the time of writing the proposal for this study in 2000, there was not even one Australian study of a mental health consumer perspective of recovery from severe mental illness reported in the literature. The principal aim of conducting this research was to address this need. The author, therefore, undertook this grounded theory study to: (a) explore what recovery from the effects of a severe mental illness meant to the consumers in Western Australia; (b) identify what consumers of mental health services in Western Australia wanted in their lives; and thus (c) develop a substantive theory of recovery. Fifteen participants diagnosed with either an affective disorder or schizophrenia were each interviewed and the resultant data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Comparative analysis is a long-held method of analysing data in sociology. Analysis is achieved by asking questions such as what, when, where, how, of the data and comparing similarities and differences with the various concepts within and across sets of data. The findings revealed that the basic social psychological problem (BSPP) for participants was LOSS. In order to address this problem, participants engaged in the basic social process (BSP) of OVERCOMING LOSS. The BSP is a title given to the central theme that emerges from the data and illustrates that a social process occurs overtime. The BSP emerged as a process comprising three phases: First Recuperation, second Moving Forward and third Getting Back.

It contributes to ongoing debates concerning agricultural liberalisation in developing economies. The general view is that while the private sector can provide access to capital, technology and markets, the transition to a market-led system will increase the financial vulnerability of farmers, particularly smallholder farmers, through unequal power relationships. Of particular concern is the capacity of the private sector to alleviate poverty and promote social equity amongst small rural landholders. At the heart of much of the debate is the issue of contract farming, which has increased rapidly in line with structural adjustment in the agricultural sector. One of the central difficulties in drawing any conclusion on whether contract farming should be encouraged or discouraged, is the lack of comparability between the large number of types of schemes, crops being contracted, the `actors' involved and the socio-economic, political and institutional environments in which contract farming schemes are nurtured. This study has focused on the role that contract farming plays in the pursuit of development through an analysis of the key socio-economic issues involved with the adaptation of contract farming in the oil palm industries in the Philippines and in Ghana. This analysis allowed for the identification of conditions under which the impacts of contract farming schemes can either be augmented or mitigated. The research found that cultivating oil palm has the propensity to reward outgrowers with increasing income and a better access to knowledge, information and technology, capital and credit, agricultural inputs, markets and other services. ... The two outgrower programs are presently successful and do not show signs of the major problems identified by researchers in other areas. However, both governments need to ensure that a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework for private sector agricultural development is put in place. A strong private sector could provide the vehicle for agricultural development and the reduction of poverty in the countryside, however, both governments and the various private sector companies engaged in oil palm production need to work in partnership with each other and the outgrower community towards the goal of a diversified and expanded agricultural production base.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Palm oil industry -- Philippines</field><field name="subject">Palm oil industry -- Ghana</field><field name="subject">Contracts, Agricultural -- Philippines</field><field name="subject">Contracts, Agricultural -- Ghana</field><field name="subject">Oil palm -- Philippines</field><field name="subject">Oil palm -- Ghana</field><field name="subject">Agricultural development projects -- Philippines</field><field name="subject">Agricultural development projects -- Ghana</field><field name="subject">Smallholder farmers</field><field name="subject">Oil palm</field><field name="subject">Contract farming</field><field name="subject">Agricultural development</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNAPL migration in single fractures : issues of scale, aperture variability and matrix diffusion</field><field name="creator">Hill, Katherine I</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] To date, many subsurface contaminant modelling studies have focused on increasing model complexity and measurement requirements to improve model accuracy and widen model application. However, due to the highly complex and heterogeneous nature of flow in the subsurface, the greater benefit in model development may lie in decreasing complexity by identifying key processes and parameters, simplifying the relationships that exist between them, and incorporating these relationships into simple models that recognise or quantify the inherent complexity and uncertainty. To address this need, this study aims to identify and isolate the key processes and parameters that control dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) and aqueous phase migration through single, onedimensional fractures. This is a theoretical representation which allows the study of processes through conceptual and mathematical models. Fracture systems typically consist of multiple two-dimensional fractures in a three-dimensional network; however, these systems are computationally and conceptually demanding to investigate and were outside of the scope of this study. This work initially focuses on DNAPL migration in single, one-dimensional fractures. The similitude techniques of dimensional and inspectional analysis are performed to simplify the system and to develop breakthrough time scale factors. This approach relies heavily on the limitations of the equation used for the analysis and on the difficulty in representing variable aperture scenarios. The complexity of the conceptual model is then increased by embedding the fracture in a two-dimensional, porous matrix. ... These tools can be readily applied by the field investigator or computer modeller to make order-of-magnitude estimates of breakthrough times, reduce or target measurement requirements, and lessen the need to employ numerical multiphase flow models. To determine the implications of the results found in the one-dimensional studies to applications at the field scale, the complexity of the conceptual model was increased to a single, two-dimensional, planar fracture embedded in a three-dimensional porous matrix. The focus of this study was not DNAPL breakthrough times but the relative importance and interaction of different mass transport processes and parameters on plume migration and evolution. Observations clearly show that estimates of the size, location and concentration of the plume is highly dependent on the geologic media, the temporal and spatial location and resolution of measurements, and on the history, mass and location of the DNAPL source. In addition, the processes controlling mass transport (especially matrix diffusion and back diffusion) act in combination at the field scale in ways not always expected from an analysis of processes acting individually at smaller spatial and temporal scales. Serious concerns over the application of the common '1% Rule of Thumb' to predict DNAPL presence and the use of remediation efforts that rely largely on natural attenuation are raised. These findings have major implications for the field worker and computer modeller, and any characterisation, monitoring or remediation program development needs to be sensitive to these findings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dense nonaqueous phase liquids</field><field name="subject">Fluids -- Migration</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics</field><field name="subject">Plumes (Fluid dynamics)</field><field name="subject">Fractures</field><field name="subject">Dense non aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL)</field><field name="subject">Numerical modeling</field><field name="subject">Similitude analysis</field><field name="subject">Matrix diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Lighthouse keeper's wife, and other stories (novel) ;  and Ceremony for ground : narrative, landscape, myth (dissertation)</field><field name="creator">Temperton, Barbara,</field><field name="description">The focus of this project is on poetry, narrative, landscape and myth, and the palimpsest and/or hybridisation created when these four areas overlay each other.

Both species exhibit a mean life-span of approximately 1 year, a production:biomass turnover rate of about 3 and potentially are capable of reproducing throughout the year, peaking during winter to spring. A. ehlersi exhibited a marine euryhaline distribution, occurring only in the main basin and lower estuary, typically at a very low density of adults; S. aequisetis exhibited a euryhaline distribution, occurring estuary-wide during both summer and winter. High density and biomass of A. ehlersi occurred in the middle estuary (at Como), predominantly as winter- recruiting juveniles. Gravid, atokous adults spawned pelagically, with a 2 to 4 month larval development period preceding settlement. Intolerance of freshwater by the pelagic larvae possibly is the major reason excluding specimens from the upper reaches of the Estuary. Adult S. aequisetis brood eggs and embryonic larvae in tubiculous burrows; the life-cycle presumably progresses entirely in sediments of relatively stable interstitial salinity (compared to pelagic fluctuations), enabling recruitment by larvae and adults into the upper reaches of the Estuary. ... The ammonification rate was higher for A. ehlersi than S. aequisetis-inhabited cores, and lowest in uninhabited cores where polychaete excretion was absent. In the absence of C2H2, sediments of S. aequisetis inhabited cores indicated a lower net NH4+ influx than uninhabited cores, whereas A. ehlersi inhabited cores exhibited a slight net efflux of NH4+ from the sediment. The difference in magnitude of nitrogenous fluxes imparted by the two polychaete species is hypothesised to relate to the influence of their respective habits on the composition and activity of their associated sedimentary microbial community. Juvenile S. aequisetis are hypothesised to homogenise and aerate sediment continually, enhancing microbial nitrification and retarding anaerobic denitrification. Permanent A. ehlersi burrows would facilitate vertical and radial oxic/anoxic stratification of sediment which, combined with enhanced substrate supply through burrow ventilation, resulted in increased rates of microbial denitrification and nitrification. I have proposed a preliminary framework by which guilds of benthic fauna, each with similar designated habits, may be tested for predictable bioturbative influence on nitrogen cycling, i.e. whether particular habits may be considered 'functional groups'. In conclusion, the fine-scale effects of A. ehlersi and S. aequisetis on microbial nitrogen cycling are integrated with details of broader-scale population dynamics to define the role of polychaetes in estuarine nitrogen cycling, with a view to managing eutrophication.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polychaeta -- Life cycles -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Population biology -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Estuarine eutrophication</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen cyle</field><field name="subject">Biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Marine sediments -- Western Australia -- Swan River Estuary</field><field name="subject">Nereidae</field><field name="subject">Australonereis ehlersi</field><field name="subject">Simplisetia aequisetis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information and communications technology (ICT), productivity and economic growth in China</field><field name="creator">Wong, Chee Kong</field><field name="description">In the current literature on productivity and economic growth, many studies have explored the relationship between information and communications technology (ICT) and growth. In these studies, ICT capital stock is treated as an individual input in the production process that contributes to output growth. In fact, ICT is found to be a key driver of productivity growth in the developed economies. However, few empirical studies deal with China which has in recent years become one of the world's largest ICT markets and production centres. The lack of empirical work in this field contrasts sharply with the wealth of literature which presents background and descriptive studies of China's high technology sectors that include the telecommunications, the computer and the Internet sectors. This dissertation attempts to fill the void in the literature by examining the role of ICT in China's economy over the past two decades. It aims to develop a framework which emphasizes ICT as a production factor and apply it to interpret China's economic growth. The dissertation contributes to the empirical literature by focusing on the following core aspects underlying the linkage between ICT and economic growth. First, it attempts to estimate the size of China's ICT capital stock using the perpetual inventory method. Second, based on such estimates, the dissertation measures the contribution of ICT to China's economic growth by means of a production function model that segregates ICT from all other forms of capital. Third, the dissertation examines the impact of ICT on technical efficiency in China's regions by applying a stochastic frontier model. Lastly, the dissertation looks at the demand aspect of the ICT industry by estimating and projecting demand for ICT services, namely, the telecommunications and computer markets in China. According to this study, ICT capital is found to be a positive driver for the Chinese economy, and is responsible for about 25% of the country's economic growth, although the percentage varies at different periods. ICT capital is also found to have a positive and significant impact on technical efficiency in the Chinese regions. However, the disparity between the coastal and inland regions in terms of technical efficiency scores is found to be very wide, due to the bulk of ICT investment going into the municipal cities and coastal provinces. It is also found that China may be facing the beginning of a period of strong productivity growth driven by increased investment in ICT, especially innovative investment. Furthermore, projections of demand show that the majority of Chinese citizens will have access to a fixed-line telephone or the mobile phone in five years from now, while about half of the Chinese population is expected to use the computer by 2010.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology -- Economic aspects -- China</field><field name="subject">China -- Economic development</field><field name="subject">High technology industries -- China</field><field name="subject">Information and communications technology</field><field name="subject">Chinese economy</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pharmacology of the mechanosensitive channels of Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thom Ngoc Minh</field><field name="description">Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are a class of ion channels which are gated by membrane stretch. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) of the bacterium E.coli has become a prototype MS channel for studying structure-function relationships in this class of ion channels. MscL homologues have commonly been found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains forming a sub-family of a larger family of MS class of ion channels encompassing prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) as well as cell-walled eukaryotes (fungi and plants). MscL and its homologues have been found to play an important role in osmoregulation of bacterial cells. Though the MS channels of bacteria have been thoroughly studied, little is known about the pharmacology of these channels. This thesis has one general aim, that is, to identify compounds which are able to gate and/or alter the gating of the MS channels of bacteria in particular, the MscL of E. coli. Using the patch-clamp technique, potential compounds mostly identified via in-silico techniques were examined to observe the effects on MscL reconstituted in artificial lipid membranes and MscS in giant bacterial spheroplasts. The compounds were tested for the ability to spontaneously gate the MscL and MscS and/or alter the Boltzmann distribution parameters of the MscL, indicative of an effect on the gating of MscL. Compounds showing potential as MscL activators were then examined for in-vivo effects using different growth assays. The effects of parabens, gallates, eriochrome cyanine R, brilliant green, deoxycholic acid are reported. Of these compounds, parabens and eriochrome cyanine R showed the most encouraging results. Identification of MS channel gate ligands not only benefits structural studies as tetrodotoxin has for the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, these compounds could also V potentially serve as base compounds for novel antibiotics which would target the MS channels of bacteria. Since the MS channels of bacteria serve as safety valves for the bacterium, gating during exposure to a hypo-osmotic challenge such as rain to release excessive cellular turgor, a pharmacological agent that could impair the gating of the MS channels releasing essential cytoplasmic osmolytes, would cause the growth impairment or death of the bacterium. With the rise in multi-drug resistant bacteria, continual development of novel antibiotics is crucial.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">Ion channels</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Mechanosensitive channels</field><field name="subject">Eriochrome cyanine</field><field name="subject">Parabens</field><field name="subject">MscL</field><field name="subject">MscS</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of price and health information in shifting young children [sic] preference towards healthier food</field><field name="creator">Dahari, Zainurin</field><field name="description">Young children have becoming an important target by marketers. Marketers have used many strategies to influence their food choices including advertising and free gifts. According to literature, young children, are cognitively vulnerable and may make unhealthy decisions about their food choices that could lead to serious problems associated with being overweight and obese. This thesis examines whether price and health claim information can shift young childrens' choices towards healthier foods. Most of the previous published research literature has focused on adults. Those findings, using surveys and experiments, suggest that adults' food preferences and choices can be influenced by setting price and by providing health information. These findings suggest that these strategies may have a potential effect in young children decision making. The literature on Children Socialization and Information Processing Theory in consumer behaviour suggests that most young children under 8 are not cognitively skilled to use price and health claim information for their decision making. Nonetheless, most 5 to 8 year olds are making purchases of food at their school canteen several times a week. In order to test for the effects of price and nutrition information, several experiments that used discrete choice modelling were conducted to determine their choices, the reliability of their choices and the between their experimental choice behaviour and their choice in the market place. More than one hundred young children, aged from five to eight years old, completed the discrete choice experiments conducted in two primary schools in the suburbs of Perth. The choice experiments on subjects that had previous experience with the food items, but did not know their relative nutritional value, showed a strong positive effect of price. In other words, higher priced options were often in more demand. Although this may appear a poor response to price by an observer, children have little knowledge of food costs, so they may use price as a surrogate for quality. Price level was also a main effect in reducing the share of unhealthy choices. The results of the analyses also show that young children can provide reliable choice decisions within 5 months of experiment. However, their experimental choices were not associated with their later choices in the canteen. These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of price and health claim information in changing young childrens' preference toward healthy choices, and the potential usefulness of using discrete choice techniques to shift children to more healthy food options.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Food -- Marketing -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Pricing</field><field name="subject">Nutritional information effect</field><field name="subject">Healthier food</field><field name="subject">Young children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and pathological predictors of survival for stage II and III colon cancer patients treated with or without chemotherapy : a population-based study</field><field name="creator">Morris, Melinda</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Clinical and pathological predictors of survival for stage II and III colon cancer patients treated with or without chemotherapy: a population-based study. Aim: Using a population-based cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC), the major aims of this study were to: 1. Identify clinico-pathological markers that can be used to define a subset of stage II colon cancer patients with excellent prognosis and who therefore do not require referral for adjuvant chemotherapy; 2. Investigate whether there is a survival benefit from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in a population-based cohort of stage II colon cancer; 3. Investigate stage III colon cancer patients for evidence of predictive markers for response to 5FU chemotherapy; 4. Investigate CRC for age-related differences in clinico-pathological and molecular features. Hypotheses to be tested: 1. A subset of good prognosis stage II colon cancers can be defined using routine pathological markers; 2. Females colon cancer patients gain more survival advantage from 5FU chemotherapy than males; 3. Tumours from young CRC patients have different molecular characteristics to those from older patients; 4. The underlying molecular characteristics of tumour can impact upon the response to 5FU chemotherapy.

The objective of this thesis is to identify and investigate several key issues associated with inward FDI in the Chinese economy. These include the determinants of FDI inflows at the sectoral level, spillover effects of FDI on labour productivity and innovation, the causal linkage between FDI and China's bilateral trade with selected OECD countries, and the performance of foreign funded enterprises (FFEs) compared to the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China. This thesis adds to the existing research on the role that FDI has played in recent growth of the Chinese economy by applying new as well as established techniques to China's regional and sectoral data. In particular, it integrates descriptive and empirical analysis to extend existing studies in several ways. First, analyses in the empirical chapters of this thesis are undertaken using data at the regional and sectoral level. Second, this thesis uses panel data from official sources for all empirical examinations. Last, whereas most existing studies have ignored the importance of unit-root issues when using panel data, and therefore possibly producing unreliable results, this thesis employs unit-root tests for all panel data analyses. The key findings in this thesis can be summarized in four points. First, at the sectoral level, for China as a whole, foreign investors are influenced by labour productivity, wage costs and innovation activities but not by the level of state ownership. For Guangdong province, foreign investors are concerned with labour productivity and wages as well as state ownership at sectoral level. However, the level of innovation does not play an important role in influencing inflows of FDI into Guangdong province at sectoral level. Second, the thesis found that FDI generates spillover effects on labour productivity in China although no spillover effects on the level of innovation were detected. At the regional level, it was concluded that the coastal and western regions experience a greater amount of spillover effects from FDI than do the municipal cities. Furthermore, the western region is the only region that experiences greater spillover effects from FDI on innovation than the municipal cities. Also, the spillover effects of FDI appear to be no different prior to or post-1997 when the Asian financial crises occurred. Third, a co-integrating relationship exists between FDI and total trade, FDI and exports, and FDI and imports in China. The thesis further concluded that bidirectional causality between FDI and trade variables exists in China in the long-run. However, short-run causality runs only from FDI to trade. Fourth, the thesis further shows that FFEs in China are more efficient than SOEs. Over time it is observed that SOEs and FFEs in the municipal cities and the coastal regions experienced greater productivity gains than those in the central and western regions during the sample period. It is also concluded that both SOEs and FFEs in the municipal cities have experienced more productivity growth than those in other regions with SOEs in the central region and FFEs in the western region experiencing the least productivity growth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investments, Foreign -- China</field><field name="subject">Econometrics</field><field name="subject">China -- Economic conditions -- Regional disparities</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Econometrics</field><field name="subject">Foreign direct investment</field><field name="subject">Panel data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of respiratory infections diagnosed in Western Australian hospital emergency departments 2000 to 2003</field><field name="creator">Ingarfield, Sharyn Lee</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Background Emergency department (ED) presentations of respiratory infections are not well described. Baseline ED data are needed to monitor trends, and to help evaluate the impact of health interventions, and assess changes in clinical practice for these conditions. Aims: To describe the epidemiology of respiratory infections diagnosed in Western Australian hospital EDs from 2000 to 2003; to determine the extent and usefulness of bacterial cultures ordered in hospital, and to describe and evaluate the antibiotic prescribing pattern in the ED setting. Methods: The cohort consisted of patients diagnosed with a respiratory infection at the ED of Perth's major metropolitan teaching hospitals from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003. The analysis was based on a linked data set containing patient data from the Emergency Department Information System, the Hospital Morbidity Data Set, the death registry, and the Ultra Laboratory Information System. Further, a sample of patient medical records from 1 adult hospital was examined to assess antibiotic prescribing practice. Results: Overall, there were 37,455 presentations (28,885 patients) given an ED diagnosis of a respiratory infection. Of these, 14,884 (39.7%, 95% CI: 39.2 to 40.2) were admitted and 715 (1.9%, 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.0) died in hospital. The infections included; 48.1% acute upper respiratory infections (URI), 18.5% pneumonia, 23.5% other acute lower respiratory infections (LRI), 7.4% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with lower respiratory infection (COPD+), 1.3% influenza or viral pneumonia and 1.2% other URI. Children accounted for 80.7% of acute URI diagnoses, COPD+ mainly affected the elderly, just over 40% of pneumonia diagnoses were in patients 65 years or older and 30.7% in patients younger than 15 years. ... The most common pathogen isolated from blood was Streptococcus pneumoniae and 10.4% (95% CI: 4.8 to 16.0) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin. For those diagnosed with pneumonia, Strep. pneumoniae accounted for over 90% of pathogens isolated from the blood of young children and isolation of Enterobacteriaceae from blood increased with age. Around 30% of patients had positive sputum cultures and from these Haemophilus influenzae, Strep. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common organisms grown. Of those diagnosed with pneumonia, acute LRI or COPD+, 34.7% (95% CI: 26.1 to 43.3) of S. aureus isolated from sputum and 16.4% (95% CI: 7.1 to 25.7) from blood were methicillin resistant. Of 366 adult patient medical records reviewed, 56.8% (95% CI: 51.7 to 61.9) noted that an antibiotic was prescribed in the ED and amoxycillin was the most frequently prescribed. For those with pneumonia, concordance between prescribing guidelines and practice was low. Conclusions The administrative data sets used in the present study are useful for monitoring outcomes for respiratory infections diagnosed in the ED. Pneumonia continues to place a burden on the hospital system. Routine blood and sputum cultures have limited value. However, an appropriately designed surveillance program is needed to monitor potential Abstract v respiratory pathogens and assist in monitoring the appropriateness of current empiric antimicrobial therapy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Respiratory infections -- Epidemiology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Emergency medicine -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Hospitals -- Western Australia -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic bacteriology</field><field name="subject">Emergency medicine</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Linked data</field><field name="subject">Respiratory infections</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Casting shadows and struggling for control : silence, resistance and negotiation in Australian Aboriginal health</field><field name="creator">Paul, David</field><field name="description">Self determination has been recognised as a basic human right both internationally and, to an extent, locally, but it is yet to be fully realised for Aboriginal Peoples in Australia.

The most characteristic features of those with cerebral palsy are the physical disabilities that arise as a result of the brain lesion, including; spasticity, muscle weakness and atrophy, soft-tissue contracture and joint deformity. Strength training for young people with cerebral palsy aims to negate the debilitating effects of muscle weakness and improve function. Research need now be dedicated to investigating the mechanisms of strength-training, in an effort to optimise training routines and the prescription of strengthening protocols. The principal goal of the present research was to investigate the impact of eccentric strength training. A novel eccentrically based exercise intervention for the upper limb was implemented to ascertain the benefits on: (i) isokinetic torque development, (ii) the length-tension relationship of muscle (iii) EMG activity, (iv) 3D movement kinematics and (v) psychosocial benefits for children and their families. The analysis of changes in movement kinematics required the development of a reliable and repeatable upper limb 3D biomechanical model for clinical use, constituting chapter three of this thesis. ...  This paper advocates the inclusion of measures of work/bodymass and width of the torque-angle relationship as important determinates of the functional integrity of muscle, and the use of EMG activation patterns to characterise neuromuscular mechanisms of training induced changes. The sixth paper aims to determine the effects of the eccentric training programme on upper limb 3D kinematics during functional tasks and to determine if these improvements were also evident on the Melbourne Assessment. Little change was evident in upper arm kinematics following the short-term eccentric training programme, however there was evidence in support of a decrease in compensatory movements at the thorax. The Melbourne Assessment failed to detect any significant changes in performance of functional upper limb tasks following the training programme. The results suggest that 3D kinematic analysis of upper body movement is a sensitive tool for the assessment of interventions for pathological populations. The aim of the seventh paper presented within this body of work was to ascertain the psychosocial outcomes for children with cerebral palsy and their families following the eccentric training programme. This study identified four main themes in the parent and participant responses to the programme; changes in physical health, psychosocial health, changes in activity and participation, and the impact of the psychosocial health of the child on the family were important to participants and their families. This paper reinforces the multi-dimensional nature of the benefits of strength-training, and advocates the assessment of interventions from perspective of the ICF (WHO, 2001).

Stress, a general term referring to factors indicative of psychological strain such as depression and anxiety, has been identified as both a cause and consequence of weight gain and obesity in some individuals. In previous research, overeating in response to stress has been investigated as either a means of mood regulation or as a response to strict dietary restraint. Cortisol, a steroid hormone that increases in response to stress, has also been linked with increased food intake in both animal and human studies. Thus, cortisol may be an additional factor contributing to overeating and weight gain in response to stress. If stress does lead to overeating and weight gain, it is also likely that stress will inhibit attempts made by obese individuals at weight loss. The first study of this thesis was a repeated measures treatment study in which the associations of stress and cortisol levels with baseline body mass index and subsequent weight loss were investigated among females participating in a cognitive behavioural weight management programme. A cross-sectional analysis prior to treatment commencement showed that the association of stress and depression with body mass index was moderated by the severity of obesity. Dichotomous thinking, a cognitive style in which events are viewed in polarised 'black and white' terms, mediated the associations of both depression and eating disorder symptomatology with BMI. ... The second study of this thesis was a controlled laboratory-based examination of food intake following an acute psychological stressor. It was hypothesised that high baseline levels of psychological stress, such as depression and anxiety, would be associated with greater increases in negative mood and cortisol levels in response to the acute stressor, both of which, in turn, would be associated with greater food intake. Contrary to the hypothesis, baseline levels of psychological stress were not associated with the extent to which negative mood and cortisol levels increased following the acute stressor. The extent to which negative mood, but not cortisol, increased following acute stress was significantly positively associated with food intake. The results do not support the hypothesis that high cortisol levels are predictive of increased food intake in human females, although the results may have been affected by the broad participant inclusion criteria. The results suggest that increases in negative mood lead to increases in food intake, although it is argued that this is unlikely to be a general effect and suggestions for future research are made. The overall aim of this research was to examine whether stress and cortisol were associated with weight status, acute changes in eating behaviour and changes in weight in the medium-term. The results are discussed in relation to this aim, wth particular focus on the differences between treatment-seeking and community samples, implications for the treatment of obesity (especially when the individual is also experiencing high levels of depression), prevention of weight gain and possible future studies of the effects of stress and depression on weight change and eating behaviour.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrocortisone -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Obesity -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology) -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Cortisol</field><field name="subject">Eating behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible-schedule-based TDMA protocols for supporting fault-tolerance, on-demand TDMA slot transfer, and peer-to-peer communication in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Louis Lee, Winnie</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis develops a scheduled protocol (time division multiple access, TDMA) called flexible-schedule-based TDMA Protocol (FlexiTP), to address the problem of providing end-to-end guarantees on data delivery, whilst also respecting severe resource constraints of wireless sensor networks. FlexiTP achieves this balance through a distributed, synchronised, and loose slot structure in which sensor nodes can build, modify, or extend their schedules based on their local information. In FlexiTP, it is not necessary to predetermine the number of slots required for a network. FlexiTP's local repair scheme allows nodes to adjust their schedules dynamically and autonomously to recover from node and communication faults. Hence, it maintains a reliable and selforganising multihop network. Most sensor network protocols designed for data gathering applications implicitly assume a periodic rate of data collection from all nodes in the network to the base station. However, nodes may want to report their data more rapidly or slowly depending on the significance and importance of their data to the end-user. The problem is that traditional TDMA-based protocols are not flexible to changes in traffic patterns because of their rigid slot structure schemes. This thesis aims to solve this problem by developing an ondemand TDMA slot transfer method that leverages the flexible-slot structure algorithm of FlexiTP to transfer time slots from one part of the network to another part. ... While these communication patterns are sufficient for monitoring applications, individual sensor nodes may need to send their data to multiple destination nodes across the network in order to execute a distributed cooperative-function based on their local environment. This peer-to-peer communication pattern makes sensor networks more reactive to triggers from the environment. This thesis attempts to solve the problem of lack of peer-to-peer communication in the design of a TDMA-driven protocol by extending the idea of on-demand TDMA slot transfer method to allow each sensor node in the network to claim extra time slots to communicate with any other nodes (peers) in the network, without going through the base station. Nodes in the network may have different priorities of data because of event-triggering sensor readings or various types of sensor readings (e.g., light, temperature, and humidity) they provide. When nodes with high priority packets increase the frequency of their data collections, the network bandwidth may be dominated by these nodes. It is desirable to allow nodes with low priority packets to aggregate their packets and so enabling these nodes to send their data to the base station under the current available network bandwidth. This thesis proposes an on-demand data aggregation algorithm that enables sensor nodes to perform an in-network-aggregation based on their current sensing requirements and network capacity constraints. In summary, this thesis describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of protocols for wireless sensor networks that focus on achieving energy-efficiency, provisioning performance assurances, and supporting reactivity and adaptability in constantly changing environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Time division multiple access</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Peer-to-peer architecture (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="subject">Energy-efficient TDMA-based protocol</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Flexible-schedule-based TDMA protocols</field><field name="subject">On-demand slot reassignment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value relevance and reliability of information provided with respect to non-current assets under Australian GAAP</field><field name="creator">Ruhupatty, Leroy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Following the introduction in 1999 of Australian Accounting Standard Board (AASB) 1041: 'Revaluations of Non-Current Assets' (Australian Accounting Standards Board 2001a), this study set out to examine the impact of the introduction of this new standard on: the number (percentage) of Australian firms revaluing various classes and submajor classes of non-current assets; and the value relevance and reliability of the information provided with respect to various sub-major classes of non-current assets. The study also set out to examine the apparent motivations for Australian companies electing the fair value (FV) basis, rather than the historic cost (HC) basis, for reporting property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E). The sample analysed in this study consisted of Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listed firms that were included in each of the Connect4, Aspect Financial and Core Research Data (CRD) databases. After excluding firms not covered by all three databases and firms where there were missing data problems, 398 and 424 firms were left in the 1999 and 2002 samples, respectively. Of the 398 and 424 firms, there were 194 firms that were common to both sample periods and a separate analysis of these 'common' firms allowed a 'like-for-like' comparison to be made. The financial year ending June 30, 1999 provides data under the previous standard AASB 1010 (Australian Accounting Standards Board 2000) before the introduction of AASB 1041, while the financial year ending 30 June 2002 provides data under AASB 1041 (the new standard). ... At the disaggregated level (that is, for various sub-major classes of non-current assets), it appears that there was a decline in the number (percentage) of firms choosing to revalue investment property, property, and plant and equipment, while there was no change in the number (percentage) of firms choosing to revalue listed or unlisted investments. It appears that AASB 1041's requirement to revalue frequently when the FV basis was adopted discouraged firms from choosing the FV basis for some asset classes, presumably because the costs associated with frequent revaluations outweighed the perceived benefits. In terms of value relevance, the results suggest that where the variables of interest are scaled there was no improvement in the value relevance of the information provided by Australian companies following the introduction of AASB 1041. However, the results from the unscaled regressions do not support this conclusion and instead suggest that the introduction of AASB 1041 was associated with an overall improvement in the value relevance of the information provided with respect to the various sub-major classes of non-current assets investigated in this study. Resolution of this conflicting result is beyond the scope of this dissertation and is an issue worthy of future research. In terms of reliability, the results suggest that the introduction of AASB 1041 was generally associated with: an improvement in the reliability of information reported with respect to non-current assets reported at FV; and a deterioration in the reliability of information reported with respect to non-current assets reported at HC. Finally, with respect to the potential motivations behind a company's choice of the FV basis for reporting PP&amp;E, the results suggest that firms are motivated to revalue PP&amp;E to: improve their borrowing capacity; for signalling purposes; and to reduce information asymmetry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accounting -- Standards -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Fair value -- Accounting</field><field name="subject">Assets (Accounting)</field><field name="subject">Value relevance</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Non-current assets</field><field name="subject">Australian GAAP</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Torsional vibration of powertrains : an investigation of some common assumptions</field><field name="creator">Guzzomi, Andrew Louis</field><field name="description">The area of powertrain dynamics has received considerable attention over a number of years. The recent introduction of more stringent emission requirements together with economic pressure has led to a particular focus on increasing powertrain efficiency. This has seen the incorporation of on-board, real-time measurements to predict system behaviour and engine condition. In this domain, accurate models for all powertrain components are important. One strategy to improve accuracy is to evaluate the assumptions made when deriving each model and then to address the simplifications that may introduce large errors. To this end, the aim of the work presented in this dissertation was to investigate the consequences of some of the more common assumptions and simplifications made in low frequency torsional powertrain models, and to propose improved models where appropriate. In particular, the effects of piston-tocylinder friction, crank/gudgeon pin offset, and the torsional behaviour of tyres were studied. Frequency and time domain models were used to investigate system behaviour and model predictions were compared with measurements on a small single cylinder engine. All time domain engine and powertrain models also include a variable inertia function for each reciprocating mechanism. It was found that piston-to-cylinder friction can increase the apparent inertia variation of a single reciprocating engine mechanism. This has implications for the nonlinear behaviour of engines and the drivetrains they are connected to. The effect of crank/gudgeon pin offset also modified the nonlinear behaviour of the mechanism. Though, for typical (small) gudgeon offset values these effects are small. However, for large offset values, achievable practically with crank offset, the modification to the nonlinear behaviour should not be ignored. The low frequency torsional damping properties of a small pneumatic tyre were found to be more accurately represented as hysteretic rather than viscous. Time domain modelling was then used to extend the results to a multi-cylinder engine powertrain and was achieved using the Time Domain Receptance (TDR) method. Various powertrain component TDRs were developed using Laplacians. Powertrain simulations showed that piston-to-cylinder friction can provide additional excitation to the system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Torsion</field><field name="subject">Automobiles -- Power trains</field><field name="subject">Automobiles -- Vibration</field><field name="subject">Automobiles -- Vibration -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicles -- Vibration</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicles -- Vibration -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Multibody dynamics (MBD)</field><field name="subject">Tyre damping</field><field name="subject">Piston-to-cylinder friction</field><field name="subject">Time domain receptance (TDR)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical environment as an influence of walking in the neighbourhood : objective measurement and validation</field><field name="creator">Learnihan, Vincent B.</field><field name="description">Over the last decade, there has been rapid growth in research into the influence of the physical environment on physical activity. Previously, individual and social factors dominated research into the influences of physical activity. This new area of study has been built on the understanding that the physical environment may create an opportunity or a barrier to engagement in physical activity behaviours (Sallis &amp; Owen, 1997). This research develops objectively measured features of the physical environment in order to investigate relationships with walking behaviour. Public health research of this nature is still at a preliminary stage, although research expertise outside of public health including transportation, urban planning and geographic information science has much to contribute to this emerging field. This study investigated walking in the neighbourhood in a sample of adults residing in Perth, Western Australia. Objective measurement of the physical environment using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was conducted including measurement of street connectivity, residential density, land use mix and retail floor area ratio at three different geographic scales (suburb, census collection district, 15 minute walk from a survey participants home). These measures were then combined into an index known as a walkability index and validated against survey participant reported data on walking within the neighbourhood using binary logistic regression. Among other findings, the evidence presented shows that depending on which geographic scale the physical environment is measured at and what type of walking in the neighbourhood is reported, the strength of relationship varies between an objectively measured walkability index and walking behaviour in the neighbourhood. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between walking for transport and walking for recreation, health and exercise when investigating the relationship between physical activity and the environment. These findings also show the importance of geographic scale of measurement in the relationship between physical activity and the physical environment, and the need for current high quality geographic data in this type of research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fitness walking -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="subject">Urban transportation -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Neighbourhood design</field><field name="subject">Physical activity</field><field name="subject">Active transport</field><field name="subject">Urban form</field><field name="subject">Geographic scale</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Procedural optimization of the quartz crystal microbalance for rapid detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7</field><field name="creator">Lim, Yimei Angelina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The applications of biosensors are rapidly expanding with the increased emphasis placed on the use of technology in the evaluation of food safety and also in military use. The United States food industry carried out 144.3 million microbiological tests in 1999 (Alocilja and Radke, 2003). These numbers are expected to rise with the recently implemented regulatory measures for food safety in the United States. In fact, similar trends in food safety are occurring on a global scale. Furthermore, with the recognition and establishment of Microbial Forensics as a new field of forensics, the interest in biosensor development for the detection of microbes will thrive. Moreover, the recent spate of biocrimes, notably the anthrax scares, has called for newer and improved techniques for the sensitive, rapid and reproducible detection of microbes. Biosensors have the capability to fill this role as an efficient device for microbial detection. There is a wide range of biosensors available for different purposes. In addition, their versatility allows for their overlap in many fields. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a biosensor that is cost-efficient, sensitive, field-deployable with the ability to perform automated, real-time assays within minutes. The QCM is a mass sensitive device that works on the principle where a change in mass deposited on the crystal is inversely proportional to the change in the resonant frequency of the crystal. Therefore, frequency decreases with increasing mass deposited. The QCM has been used in several studies as a biosensor for the detection of a number of viral and bacterial species. ... High antibody incubation concentration required a shorter antibody incubation duration. Conversely, low antibody incubation concentration required a longer antibody incubation duration. Furthermore, regardless of antibody incubation concentration, a distinct pattern in the rate of antibody binding with time was observed. One hour antigen incubation at ambient room temperature (22.5oC) was sufficient for the efficient binding of the antigens to the immobilized antibody layer. Extension of antigen binding time to 15 hours produced inconsequential differences in readings. The binding efficiency of the quartz crystals after a storage period of 2 to 4 weeks at ambient room temperature (22.5oC) fared better than the crystals that were refrigerated at 4oC. Results showed that 0.2M glycine hydrochloride is a poor reagent for the removal of the antigen layer on the quartz crystals for repeated assay use. The 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA) layer and adsorbed proteins on the quartz crystals can be removed by a mixture of sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, known as a piranha process. This allows the crystals to be repeatedly recoated and reused. Overall, this research provides new insights into the preparation process of the quartz crystals for the specific detection of E. coli O157:H7. Conclusive results have been obtained for several tested parameters and suggestions have been raised for further studies in the optimization of the QCM for the E. coli O157:H7 detection process. With improved knowledge and recognition in the capability of the QCM as a biosensor, the QCM may soon be used in conjunction with conventional techniques for the rapid detection of E. coli O157:H7.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biosensors</field><field name="subject">Quartz crystal microbalances</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli O157:H7</field><field name="subject">Microbiology -- Technique</field><field name="subject">Food contamination -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Biosensor</field><field name="subject">Quartz crystal microbalance</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli O157:H7</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular dissection of RANKL signaling pathways in osteoclasts</field><field name="creator">Wang, Cathy Ting-Peng</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Bone remodeling is intricately regulated by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. The elevation in osteoclast number and/or activity is a major hallmark of several common pathological bone disorders including post-menopausal osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, Paget's disease, and tumour-mediated osteolysis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) is a key cytokine for osteoclast differentiation and activation. The association of RANKL to its cognate receptor, RANK, which is expressed on osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts, is essential for osteoclast formation and activation. The intimate interaction between RANKL and RANK triggers the activation of a cascade of signal transduction pathways including NF-&#954;B, NFAT, MAPK and PI3 kinase. Although osteoclast signaling pathways have been intensively studied, the precise molecules and signaling events which underlie osteoclast differentiation and function remain unclear. In order to dissect the molecular mechanism(s) regulating osteoclast differentiation and activity, this thesis herein explores the key RANKL/RANK-mediated signaling pathways. Four truncation mutants within the TNF-like domain of RANKL [(aa160-302), (aa160-268), (aa239-318) and (aa246-318)] were generated to investigate their potential binding to RANK and the activation to RANK-signal transduction pathways. All were found to differentially impair osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption as compared to the wild-type RANKL. The impaired function of the truncation mutants of RANKL on osteoclast formation and function correlates with their reduced ability to activate crucial RANK signaling including NF-&#954;B, I&#954;B&#945;, ERK and JNK. Further analysis revealed that the truncation mutants of RANKL exhibited differentially affinity to RANK as observed by in vitro pull-down assays. ...  It is possible that Bryostatin 1 acts via upregulation of a fusion mechanism as the RANKL-induced OCLs are morphologically enlarged, exhibiting increased nuclei number expressing high level of DC-Stamp. Furthermore, Rottlerin was shown to inhibit NF-&#954;B activity, whereas Bryostatin 1 showed the opposing effects. Both inhibitor and activator were also found to modulate other key osteoclastic signaling pathways including NFAT and total c-SRC. These findings implicate, for the first time, Protein Kinase C delta signaling pathways in the modulation of RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and activity. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis provide compelling molecular, biochemical and morphological evidence to suggest that: (1) RANKL mutants might potentially serve as peptide mimic to inhibit RANKL-induced signaling, osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. (2) A cross talk mechanism between extracellular Ca2+ and RANKL exist to regulate on osteoclast survival. (3) TPA suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis predominantly during the early stage of osteoclast differentiation via modulation of NF-&#954;B. (4) Selective inhibition of Protein Kinase C signaling pathways involved in osteoclastogenesis might be a potential treatment method for osteoclast-related bone diseases. (5) Protein Kinase C delta signaling pathways play a key role in regulating osteoclast formation and function.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporosis</field><field name="subject">Osteoclasts</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Calcium</field><field name="subject">Osteoporosis</field><field name="subject">Osteoclasts</field><field name="subject">Bone resorption</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary differentation in Lolium L. (Ryegrass) in response to the Mediterranean-type climate and changing farming systems of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ferris, David Glen</field><field name="description">Adaptation of exotic species to the Australian landscape poses a serious threat to the integrity of natural ecosystems and profitability of current farming systems. Ryegrass, an outcrossing species complex (Lolium spp.) and an intractable weed of cropping systems, was used as a candidate to further investigate adaptation within Mediterranean-type environments. Evolutionary differentiation in naturalised populations and their adaptive potential were examined in common gardens by characterising the genetic variability within and between 80 populations collected across 8 cropping regions, and 30 populations from adjacent paddocks differing in key management inputs. Morphological variability within and between populations was not found to be simply the consequence of variable distribution in the number and frequency of taxonomic species which colonised Australia with European settlement. Most plants were intermediate in appearance between L. rigidum Gaud. and L. multiflorum Lam. Ecotypic differentiation between regions was clearly evident even though the vast majority of variation in life history traits was found within sites (except for flowering time, 18%). Overall, as growing season length decreased flowering time and spikelet number per spike also decreased; conversely, florets per spikelet, flag leaf size, and population uniformity increased. Larger leaves and lower maternal investment per seed may confer an adaptive advantage in more arid, cropping intensive habitats where competition to intercept light is intense and moisture availability during seed fill more uncertain. By contrast smaller, more numerous leaves and a wider diversity in life history traits may confer an adaptive advantage in higher rainfall, grazing intensive habitats where the risk of predation (consumption) of plant parts is greater and a wider range of biotic pressures abound. iv However, in spite of the large amount of variability in morphological traits upon which selection could act, no evidence was found to support the claim that ryegrass would change in response to mechanical seed collection at harvest (chaff-cart use) to circumvent such control. The frequency of a deleterious adaptation to acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibiting herbicides appeared stable in one population after 13 years without herbicide use. Notwithstanding, the frequency of herbicide resistance declined sharply within a 20 m zone adjacent to a susceptible area but this has only limited agronomic benefit. By contrast, the potential to decimate the frequency of resistance by sowing herbicide-susceptible tetraploid ryegrass was identified, and glasshouse results were consistent with the minority cytotype exclusion principle. Possible experimental approaches to field validate this novel concept and key issues to be resolved are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ryegrasses -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ryegrasses -- Evolution -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ryegrasses -- Adaptation -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ryegrasses -- Genetics -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance of family firms and voluntary disclosure : the case of Indonesian manufacturing firms</field><field name="creator">Tarmizi, Achmad</field><field name="description">Weakness in corporate governance and lack of transparency are often considered causes of, or contributors to, the Asian Financial Crisis. Publicly listed companies in Indonesia, like other Asian firms, have a concentrated ownership structure. Focusing on manufacturing firms listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) for the year 2003, this study adopts an agency framework to examine voluntary disclosures included in the annual reports of 149 Indonesian firms and their relationship to various attributes such as: ownership structure; whether a firm is family-owned or not; the owner's involvement in either the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors; and whether the firm is affiliated with a business group. The results mostly support the notion that ownership structure affects the extent of disclosure in annual reports. First, the results show that, compared to firms with a nonmajority ownership structure, voluntary disclosure is lower in firms with a majority ownership structure. Second, the results indicate that family owned firms are more likely to exhibit lower voluntary disclosure than are non-family owned firms. Third, the analysis shows that, among family firms, firms with a majority (compared to those with a non-majority) ownership structure are more likely to have lower levels of voluntary disclosure. Fourth, the results indicate that, among family firms, firms affiliated with a business group are more likely to make lower voluntary disclosures than independent firms. In contrast, the empirical analysis failed to support the hypothesis that, among family firms, voluntary disclosure would be lower in firms where the owners are involved in the Board of Commissioners compared to those where there is no owner involvement in the Board of Commissioners. Similarly, the results failed to support the hypothesis that, among family firms, voluntary disclosure would be lower in firms where the owners are involved in the Board of Directors compared to those where there is no owner involvement in the Board of Directors. Robustness checks performed using alternate measures of disclosure and the degree of ownership structure did not substantially change the conclusions. This thesis contributes to our understanding of how family firms are governed and the impact of corporate governance on a firm?s level of voluntary disclosure. The results have implications for policy makers and regulators in Indonesia striving to improve corporate governance and transparency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Financial statements</field><field name="subject">Financial crises -- Asia</field><field name="subject">Disclosure of information -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production and composition of milk from 10 - 60 days of lactation in mothers who delivered prematurely</field><field name="creator">Lai, Ching Tat</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mothers who deliver prematurely often have a delay in lactogenesis II and subsequent milk supply. Furthermore, due to the inability of their babies to breastfeed immediately after birth, these mothers are 'pump dependent' during both initiation and establishment of lactation. Apparently, there are no evidence based guidelines for the expression regime but some data suggesting that expression regimes for both breasts should be at least five times per day and at least 100 minutes expressing time per day. The project was set out to document the self selected current expression regimes of the preterm mothers from day 10 to 60 postpartum. It defined how various aspects of breast expression, such as frequency and interval, impact on the synthesis and production of milk. In addition, it determined the variations in the composition of preterm mother's milk. The collection of 24hr expression data and milk samples at each expression of each breast, each day, of 25 preterm mothers (&lt;32 gestation age) from the neonatal intensive care unit in King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia on day 10, 15-20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 postpartum showed that during the 'pump dependent' period (day 10  20), the frequency of expression for both breasts was 6, 6-7, 3-9 times per day (median, IQR, range) and total duration with the pump was 115, 80-160, 32-320 minute per day (median, IQR, range). Furthermore, during the 'transition from exclusively expressing to exclusively breastfeeding' period (day 30-60), frequency of expression/breastfeed and total duration of milk removal (both expressing and breastfeeding) for both breasts were 6, 5-7, 1-9 and 135, 75-170, 25-320, respectively (median, IQR, range). ...  These nutrients make up the energy content of milk, thus the energy content of milk also varied greatly between mothers. Therefore, milk from individual preterm mothers varies greatly for individual values for fat, total protein, lactose and energy and this should be taken into account when calculating the level of fortification required for individual babies. The results suggest that when fortifying mother's milk, weekly measurement of fat and protein in milk would provide good estimates on which to base fortification requirements. The concentration of sIgA plus lactoferrin formed 32% of the total proteins in breastmilk. However there was large variations in the concentration of sIgA and lactoferrin (median, IQR, range: 0.82, 0.59-1.13, 0.05-2.93g/l and 2.41, 1.52-3.52, 0.04-8.82g/l, respectively) between mothers. Therefore the level of protection provided by these two proteins could differ greatly between babies. Further research on the relationship between the concentration of sIgA and lactoferrin in milk and the onset of infection would indicate the minimum amount of these proteins needed for the babies to benefit from the immune protection provided by their mother's milk. The hourly breast expression method and regression analysis of actual milk yield and interval since previous expression provides information that identifies the potential milk synthesis capacity of the breasts of the mothers and the impact of the interval between expressions on the milk production of the mothers. This information can be applied to individualize the interval between expression regimes to optimise milk production and minimize the demand on the mother. In addition, determining the changes in the milk composition of individual mothers would provide a more precise base to fortify their milk for their preterm babies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Premature babies -- Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Breast milk -- Composition</field><field name="subject">Lactation</field><field name="subject">Breastfeeding</field><field name="subject">Preterm mother</field><field name="subject">Human milk</field><field name="subject">Breast expression</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells : from experimental remyelination to multiple sclerosis</field><field name="creator">Jennings, Alison Ruth</field><field name="description">In experimental models of demyelination such as cat optic nerve injected with antibody to galactocerebroside, stepwise and ultimately full repair occurs, starting with recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OP) from surrounding tissue and culminating in remyelination by young competent oligodendrocytes. Endogenous repair of demyelination can also occur in the adult human central nervous system, as evidenced by remyelinated shadow plaques in MS, but ultimately fails in this disease, leading to areas of chronic demyelination where surviving axons are both dysfunctional in terms of conduction and vulnerable to ongoing damage. In order to meaningfully investigate this failure of remyelination in the human situation, an essential prerequisite is to be able to reliably identify the neuroglial cells, and in particular, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, involved in the repair pathway in situ in post mortem tissue. While some marker antigens have been shown to remain demonstrable despite autolytic change and through differing fixation levels, others are far more sensitive and only reliable in freshly obtained tissue with light fixation. For instance, the surface antigens NG2 and PDGF&#945;R, which have been widely used in experimental studies as a marker for OP both in vivo and in vitro, have been shown to be adversely affected by both fixation and autolysis. To this end, the cat optic nerve demyelination model, in which the reparative oligodendrocyte lineage stages have been antigenically defined, was extended to normal optic nerve including lightly fixed tissue. Here, NG2, PDGF&#945;R and the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 were able to be demonstrated and then correlated with the existing antigenic phenotypes. Subsequently, normal human optic nerve, optimised for both morphological preservation and antigen retention, was used to develop an in vivo staining profile for all neuroglia including OP, that was then applied to conventionally prepared, normal and MS tissue. It was found that, with careful attention to technical parameters such as post mortem interval and details of fixation, OP and other stages of the remyelinating oligodendrocyte lineage could be identified in such material, resulting in meaningful insight into the repair status of the three MS samples studied.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiple sclerosis -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Optic nerve</field><field name="subject">Neuroglia -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Oligodendroglia</field><field name="subject">Myelination</field><field name="subject">Demyelination</field><field name="subject">Neuroglial cell identification</field><field name="subject">Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initial and repeated burglary victimisation : victim vulnerability, same offender involvement and implications for theory and crime prevention</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Frank</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines the phenomenon of repeat burglary and its significance for crime prevention, criminology and victimology. The research program for this thesis was inspired some time ago by the Kirkholt burglary prevention project in the United Kingdom. The reduction of repeat victimisation quickly came to be seen as the key to Kirkholt?s success and by the late twentieth century victim-based crime prevention projects had been implemented in many parts of the world. However, even though these projects have achieved notable success there is still intense debate about why one-time victims are more likely than others to become future victims. This thesis aims to increase understanding of repeat burglary and other forms of repeat victimisation by contributing to its key concepts and its methods of analysis, and by applying these insights in Australian settings. In pursuing this endeavour the thesis links the problems of repeat victimisation with problems in other areas of criminology and social science. In particular the issue of whether prior victimisation is a cause of future victimisation or merely a marker of pre-existing risk has analogs in the areas of offending, of employment, in international disputes, and in many others. Despite this, there has been limited transfer of methods and concepts between repeat victim researchers and researchers in other areas. The thesis examines repeat burglary as a substantive area of research, but its approaches to method, concepts and data are relevant to all repeat victimisation research. ...  It draws together criminological theory, conceptual analysis, and a pioneering application of survival analysis to pursue the mechanisms underlying repeat burglary in a Perth suburb. In doing so it illuminates issues about the relative power of state dependence and heterogeneity explanations of repeat burglary and arrives at substantive results that in some aspects differ from findings in the United Kingdom. This section also argues that the concept of state dependence commonly adopted is iv unnecessarily constraining and that a broader concept can explain some potentially conflicting findings of repeat victimisation research. Section 3 is an evaluation of a victim-focused burglary prevention initiative in Adelaide  one of two nationally supported pilot projects. Section 4 examines carefully the claimed advantages of victim-focused crime prevention for distributing burglary prevention resources in an efficient and equitable way. It examines evidence concerning the differential capacity and willingness of victims to take effective preventive action and the need for both individual and collective support for effective preventive initiatives. Section 5 concludes the thesis by arguing first that the merging of victim support and crime prevention is not as simple as is sometimes claimed. It also argues that crime prevention needs to take into account more than criminological theory if it is to be effective. An important argument of the conclusion is that criminological imagination has been overly limited in comprehending repeat victimisation, and it explores the ways in which criminological research still struggles to appreciate the importance of the victim for theory and crime prevention. It also argues that the implications of repeat victimisation have yet to be fully developed and accepted.

To upgrade the existing detectors requests implementing very high optical power, as well as very high circulating power in the arm cavities; these measures will increase the sensitivity at the shot noise floor by one order of magnitude. However, such extremely high power circulation in the cavities will cause optical distortions in the test masses. Thermal distortions arise from the optical power absorption by defects or inhomogeneities in test masses, resulting in wavefront deformations, which have important consequences for the power buildup of the Radio-Frequency (RF) sidebands in the recycling cavities, thus degrading the performance of the detectors. The degree of this sensitivity degradation in the shot noise floor, due to optical distortions induced by defects or inhomogeneities (i.e. imperfections) in test masses in Advanced Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Detectors, is dependent on the test mass optical quality; while the sensitivity degradation in the thermal noise floor is dependent on the test mass mechanical properties. For this reason, it is compulsory to use high optical and mechanical quality test mass materials in the advanced interferometer detectors. Fused silica has been used for test masses in detectors, while sapphire has been planned to be used for test mass substrates in the proposed Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational-wave Telescope (LCGT) project. Other materials, such as calcium fluoride (CaF2), are also attractive, especially for cryogenic detectors. However, for the state-of-theAbstract II art facilities, it is difficult to manufacture very uniform, defect-free, inhomogeneity-free, high-quality, and large-size samples. Thus, the qualities of sapphire and calcium fluoride single crystal samples were investigated and evaluated, to ensure that they have suitable properties for use in interferometer detectors, i.e. with an adequately low level of imperfections, but also with high mechanical quality factor (Q-factor). This thesis describes research done in the endeavour to investigate bulk defects or inhomogeneities in test masses, as well as their induced thermal distortions, which appear at a high optical power in Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Detectors. An Automatic Rayleigh Scattering Mapping System (ARSMS) to examine the optical property of large-size test masses is described. This ARSMS enables quantitative high-resolution 3D mapping of defects or inhomogeneities in optical materials. The measured 3D defect distribution mapping of optical materials can assist in the design of suitable configurations of test masses in high optical power interferometers. In addition, a very sensitive Hartmann wavefront sensor was used to actively monitor the thermal distortions due to bulk and coating absorption in test masses. A very strong thermal distortion in these test masses was observed in the Gingin facility, demonstrating that thermal distortions could be a critical issue in advanced interferometer detectors. A negative thermo-optical coefficient material, to be used in a thermal distortion compensation method, was investigated for the compensation of very localised distortions due to imperfections. This thesis also includes experimental and theoretical studies of the scattering, absorption, and birefringence mechanisms, thermal distortion effects, and optimal compensation methods for test masses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement -- Instruments</field><field name="subject">Laser interferometers</field><field name="subject">Optical materials</field><field name="subject">Anisotropy</field><field name="subject">Sapphires -- Optical properties</field><field name="subject">Gravitational-wave</field><field name="subject">Scattering</field><field name="subject">Test masses</field><field name="subject">Defects</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calixarene chemistry en route to nano-fabrication of phosphonated analogues</field><field name="creator">Clark, Thomas Edward</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An efficient synthesis of the p-phosphonic acid calix[n]arenes, (n = 4, 5, 6 and 8) in five steps and excellent yield has been developed. This includes the key use of an acetyl protecting group, which is straightforward to introduce and remove using acetic anhydride and potassium hydroxide respectively. The synthesized p-phosphonic acid calixarenes are water-soluble and the hydrogen bonding prowess of the acidic groups dominates its selfassembly processes. For p-phosphonic acid calix[4]arene these include the formation of nano-rafts in the gas phase (&#8804; 20 molecules) and nano-particles (3.0(3) and 20.0(2) nm) of the calixarene in water using spinning disc processing stabilized by acetonitrile. The larger p-phosphonic acid calix[5,6,8]arenes also show nano-raft formation in both solution and the gas phase. An extensive study of the supramolecular chemistry of calix[5]arene has also been undertaken to better understand its rich structural diversity. This includes the formation of chloromethane inclusion complexes of p-tert-butyl-calix[5]arene and p-H-calix[5]arene with dichloromethane, p-phenyl-calix[5]arene with chloroform and their potential application as gas storage materials. Along with these three investigated inclusion complexes are two sublimates of p-H-calix[5]arene (&#945; and &#946;) with only the &#946;-polymorph active for sorption of carbon dioxide at room temperature and 1 atm. The &#945;-polymorph adopts an inverted cone conformation and forms helical stacks in the extended structure whereas the &#946;-polymorph adopts the usual cone conformation and packs in both 'self included' and 'back-to-back' helical arrangements. ... Complementary to this study involved the p-H-calix[5]arene inclusion complexes with fluoro-, chloro-, bromo- and iodobenzene. All but the iodobenzene complexes are isostructural forming columnar arrays in the extended packing comprised of 'tri-calix[5]arene' segments. Iodobenzene is too large to form the respective 'tri-calix[5]arene' segments and instead forms sheets in the extended packing. To better understand the type and nature of the intermolecular interactions present within the supermolecules and extended structures a detailed Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed. A detailed Hirshfeld surface analysis was also performed on O-octadecyl-calix[6]arene, which crystallizes in the inverted double cone conformation. Three alkyl chains on either side interplay to form one side of hexagon in an hexagonal close packed array of interdigitated alkyl chains. This was the first Hirshfeld surface analysis performed at variable temperatures and enhanced the description of such a large supramolecular system. The related compound O-octadecyl-calix[4]arene was found to crystallize from toluene or benzene as supramolecular bilayers, 32.2(4) and 32.7(2) &#197; thick respectively. The calixarenes adopt the cone conformation and the alkyl chains interplay to form a continuous hexagonal motif similar to that seen for O-octadecyl-calix[6]arene. The formation of stable bilayers using octadecyl chains leads to the possibility of inserting long chain calixarenes with suitable functionalization into biological membranes. Such functionalization could include upper rim phosphorylation as seen for the p-phosphonic acid calixarenes to produce phospholipid mimics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">Calixarenes</field><field name="subject">Nanostructures</field><field name="subject">Self-assembly</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0052</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal biogeochemical changes of groundwater associated with managed aquifer recharge in two different geographical areas</field><field name="creator">Reed, Deborah A.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a technique that can be used to capture and store water in aquifers for later reuse. This method recycles water that would normally be lost or discarded to the environment. MAR has been observed to have the potential for improving the quality of recharged water through a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in groundwater microbial population structure during MAR and the major influences that drive these population changes. Biogeochemical MAR studies have the potential to assist in the improved prediction of the removal of contaminants such as nutrients, pathogens and trace organics from the recharged water. Biological clogging during recharge also has the potential to overwhelm an aquifers ability to process wastewater thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. Therefore further research into the spatial and temporal biogeochemical processes that occur during MAR is required. The geochemical and microbial population dynamics of two contrasting MAR techniques were investigated at two different geographical locations (Perth, Western Australia and Adelaide, South Australia). These MAR sites contained aquifers of dissimilar properties that were recharged with wastewater that contrasted in water quality. The Perth MAR site received secondary treated effluent which continuously infiltrated the unsaturated zone into an unconfined aquifer aided by infiltration galleries. Reclaimed water was extracted from a well at distance from the infiltration gallery. ...  Notably the background and recovered water was most dissimilar in microbial and chemical population structure to that described for the infiltration gallery and injection well. Microbial and chemical evidence suggested that the background and extraction well groundwater were unaffected by plume migration. These results suggested that extraction well groundwater was similar in quality to that of ambient groundwater. Significant geochemical and microbial changes of secondary treated effluent during infiltration and lateral movement through aquifer were implicated in addition to the forced hydraulic gradient created from extracting fives time the volume of infiltrating wastewater. This study demonstrated that microbial populations and the geochemical processes associated with MAR can be studied and compared. Multivariate statistical methodology greatly simplified a vast array of dynamic biogeochemical information that could be dissected for meaningful interpretation over distance and time. The study evaluated the major biogeochemical influences which resulted in microbial and geochemical changes where it was noted that microbial populations were more dynamic than geochemical variation over time. Additionally biogeochemical comparative analysis indicated that microbial populations could change in population structure before a shift in aquifer geochemistry was detected. It is anticipated that the results from this study will benefit further research into the biogeochemical processes involved in water quality changes (e.g. nutrient removal, pathogen decay and biodegradation of trace organics) as well as controlling biological clogging of MAR schemes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial groundwater recharge</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Aquifers -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Aquifers -- South Australia -- Adelaide</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Western Australia -- Perth -- Quality</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- South Australia -- Adelaide -- Quality</field><field name="subject">Water reuse -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Water reuse -- South Australia -- Adelaide</field><field name="subject">Managed aquifer recharge</field><field name="subject">Groundwater biogeochemistry</field><field name="subject">Microbial population dynamics</field><field name="subject">Multivariate statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0074</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator">Central Queensland University Library</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2006-04-12</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theses</field><field name="identifier">http://www.library.cqu.edu.au/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of desiccation stress on the ecophysiology of the intertidal macroalga, Stictosiphonia arbuscula, in relation to season and zonation</field><field name="creator">Loughnan, Abigale Ella</field><field name="description">Seaweeds that occupy the intertidal zone grow in distinct vertical bands. Elucidating the causes of zonation of intertidal seaweeds has been a key question for over a century, and the prevailing paradigm is that species occupying the higher shore position are limited by abiotic factors associated with exposure to atmospheric conditions, whereas for the lower-shore species competition is considered to limit a macroalga&#65533;s distribution. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of desiccation, and to a lesser extent nutrient limitation, on the distribution of Stictosiphonia arbuscula, a red intertidal seaweed that grows in a wide vertical band in the mid - high shore region. A multi-disciplinary approach was used to investigate the effect of desiccation at different functional levels, from individual cells to the whole organism. Ecophysiological comparisons were made on high-shore and low-shore populations to determine whether the upper and lower shore distributions have different abilities to tolerate and recover from desiccation stress during summer and winter. The effect of desiccation was visually assessed, using electron microscopy, at the cellular and whole organism level. Carbohydrate and pigment concentrations were determined to provide information on how S. arbuscula allocates its resources between winter and summer.
	Investigations into the ability of Stictosiphonia arbuscula to tolerate and recover photosynthetic capacity after desiccation events (relative humidity (R.H.) 5% and 40%; ranging from 30 minutes - 24 hours) unexpectedly revealed no differences between high- and low-shore specimens. However, there were seasonal differences, with summer specimens better able to recover both tissue water content and photosynthetic capacity after desiccation compared to winter specimens, especially after desiccation for 24 hours. In contrast high-shore specimens had increased rates of nitrogen uptake after mild desiccation treatments, compared to low-shore specimens during summer, and specimens from the low-shore had increased variability in their uptake rates, indicating disruption to the uptake mechanisms, compared to the high-shore specimens. S. arbuscula was able to recover photosynthetic capacity faster than nitrogen and phosphorus uptake during re-immersion after desiccation, which indicates that the ability to regain photosynthetic function may be more important for this species than regaining the ability to take up nitrogen and phosphorus. As S. arbuscula can photosynthesise in air (providing there is sufficient tissue water content) and water, the &#65533;window of opportunity&#65533; to assimilate carbon is greater than for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, which is only available to S. arbuscula during immersion at high tides. Despite this, no evidence was found of severe nutrient limitation in either high- or low-shore specimens.
	The disruption and recovery of cellular organisation during rehydration, assessed visually using electron microscopy, showed that the rate and duration of desiccation also affected the extent of recovery. Extremely desiccating conditions (R.H. 5%) damaged the cells and no recovery was observed during rehydration, compared to moderate desiccation treatments (R.H. 40%) where the time taken to recover during rehydration increased with increasing desiccation periods. The disruption of cellular organisation observed in Stictosiphonia arbuscula cells, was found to match the reduction and / or disruption to photosynthesis and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus under similar desiccation regimes. The formation of ridges and depressions on the surface of the tissue was also observed during desiccation, which is thought to help reduce the rate of evaporation by trapping &#65533;pockets&#65533; of air.
	Finally, Stictosiphonia arbuscula is extremely well suited to the mid - high region in the intertidal zone and it can maximise its competitive ability within this niche during immersion by fully rehydrating within 10 minutes, regaining maximum photosynthetic capacity within 20 minutes, and stability of nutrient uptake rates within 90 minutes. Further, S. arbuscula has higher rates of photosynthesis in winter, associated with increased photosynthetic pigment concentrations at this time. In contrast, during summer, the photosynthetic rates, chlorophyll a and phycobiliprotein concentrations are reduced and S. arbuscula increases its allocation of resources into protective mechanisms such as UV-absorbing compounds.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine algae</field><field name="subject">intertidal macroalga</field><field name="subject">Stictosiphonia arbuscula</field><field name="subject">ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.182823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-conceptualising television advertising typologies</field><field name="creator">Aitken, Robert Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new typology of television advertising that re-orientates existing research into advertising effectiveness and more accurately reflects new directions in communication theory. The typology provides a consumer-centric approach to analysing television advertisements and a different conceptualisation of the advertising response process.

Conventional research into advertising effectiveness has examined almost every aspect of the advertising mix to identify what makes an advertisement effective. The research is based on a number of assumptions. For example, mass communication is seen as a linear process with the advertiser at one end of a communication continuum and the consumer at the other. The function of advertising, in this reception paradigm, is to inform and then to influence the consumer and measures of its success include accuracy of recall and recognition. This process of persuasion comprises a number of hierarchical steps that should lead to purchase or to a positive propensity to purchase. The power of persuasion is related to the level of involvement between the advertised product and the potential customer and with the appropriateness of the advertised message and its execution. For example, elements such as music, humour and the use of celebrities have been studied to assess their persuasive powers and to understand their communication effects.

This thesis takes a different approach to understanding how advertising works and makes a number of different assumptions. According to this thesis, before it is possible to study the effects of advertising, it is necessary to find out how people respond to it. This introduces the three key concepts that underpin this thesis. These are reader-response theory, personal construct theory and uses and gratifications theory.

Reader-response theory suggests that the meaning and significance of any form of communication is co-created at the point of engagement. The meaning of a television advertisement, for example, is located, not in the advertisement itself, as in conventional research, but in the interaction between the advertisement and the viewer. The meanings that result in this process of negotiation are as much a reflection of personal, social and cultural experience as they are a response to particular executional and message strategies. To understand how consumers make sense of these communication texts it is necessary to study them at the point of reception.

The second key concept, personal construct theory, proposes that the way individuals make sense of their experiences and understand the world is determined by the personal constructs that they hold. Identifying these constructs will enable researchers to understand the meanings that consumers attach to communication messages and to focus more fundamentally on the psychological basis of the response process than on its individual components. Studying advertising effectiveness in the context of personal construct theory places the consumer at the centre of the response process and focuses attention on how meaning is negotiated. This has a number of important implications for practioners both in relation to the construction of television advertisements and in understanding consumers&#65533; responses to them. For example, practioners need to recognise the importance of producing television advertisements that address their audience as readers of media texts rather than merely as consumers of media products.

This re-conceptualising of the audience is clearly articulated in uses and gratifications theory, the third key concept in this study. Uses and gratifications theory, suggests that it is as important to understand what consumers do with advertising as it is to study what advertising does to consumers. This is in contrast to the emphasis on persuasion strategies in conventional advertising research.

Reader-response theory, personal construct theory and uses and gratifications theory suggest a more dynamic relationship between an advertisement and a consumer than is recognised by conventional research. These theories are encapsulated in a new typology of television advertising presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television advertising</field><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.181805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schools for the people? : church, state, and educational control in Scotland to 1872</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Julie Elaine</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the changing face of educational provision in nineteenth-century Scotland. In particular, it examines the reasons behind the Church of Scotland&#65533;s loss of official authority over schooling in 1872. From the time of the Reformation, the Church had been empowered to supervise all education in Scotland, to play the major role in the appointment of teachers, and to ensure that landowners assumed their responsibilities in the placing of a school in every parish. However, this authority had never operated straightforwardly, and in 1803 an Education Act transferred significant aspects of the Church&#65533;s power over the appointment of teachers in parochial schools - and therefore over the curriculum of those schools - to local landowners. In the course of the nineteenth century, the Church&#65533;s position was eroded still more substantially, until the Education Act of 1872 formally gave control over State sponsored establishments to locally-elected School Boards. The Church&#65533;s loss of power was directly connected with the formation of a system of universal, compulsory schooling for Scotland&#65533;s children.
	The study is structured in seven chapters. Chapter 1 considers the background to the educational developments of the nineteenth century: the profound social and ecclesiastical consequences of demographic change, industrialisation, and urbanisation. Section A (Chapters 2-4) explores the history of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s work in education, and the emergence of other churches which actively developed additional and rival schools in the 1800s. Chapter 2 examines the origins and working of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s system of parochial schools, and the responses of this system to a changing educational environment. Chapters 3-4 assess the place of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s ancillary institutions, Sessional and Assembly schools, and the activities of the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK). Detailed consideration is given to the educational efforts of four other major denominations - the Free Church of Scotland, the United Presbyterian Church, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church - and to the schools established by the Society of Friends. The demonstrable inability of the Church of Scotland to meet its statutory obligations in both rural and urban areas, and the sheer scale of the educational provision made by other bodies, fostered a growing perception that responsibility for schooling could not be entrusted to any single voluntary institution, but required to be vested in the State.
	Section B (Chapters 5-7) examines the evolving ideals of rescue and reformation of the &#65533;perishing classes&#65533; in the work of Sunday, ragged, industrial, and reformatory schools, and the parts played by such schools in educating the poorest members of British society in the nineteenth century. As these parts can all be seen to be interconnected, it emerges that the Church of Scotland&#65533;s withdrawal from Sunday-school provision in 1799 compromised its capacity to meet the needs of a growing constituency of vulnerable children, and exacerbated its inability to provide appropriate instruction for those most affected by the turmoil of industrialisation. The lay composition of the committees that managed all of these schools also contributed to the marginalisation of the institutional voice of the Church in administering Scotland&#65533;s education.
	In the end, the Church of Scotland lost control to the State in 1872 because it was unable to adapt its parochial structure sufficiently to provide appropriate schooling to meet the challenges of a changed world.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Scotland</field><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="subject">church and education</field><field name="subject">church history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.182314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogical possibilities for nursing</field><field name="creator">Neehoff, Shona Maree</field><field name="description">Nursing practice is a very physical business. The work that most nurses do involves the use of their bodies as the primary tool of their work. Nurses take their physical selves to patients in order to carry out that work, the body of the nurse is often in direct contact with the bodies of patients that they care for. This thesis is about what I have called the &#65533;invisible bodies of nursing&#65533;, and I describe these throughout the body of the thesis. The physical body of the nurse, the body of practice, and the body of knowledge.
	The physical body of the nurse is absent in most nursing literature, it is sometimes inferred but seldom discussed. My contention is that the physical body of the nurse is invisible because it is tacit. Much nursing practice is invisible because it is perceived by many nurses to be inarticulable and is carried out within a private discourse of nursing, silently and secretly. Nursing knowledge is invisible because it is not seen as being valid or authoritative or sanctioned as a legitimate discourse by the dominant discourse.
	I approach these issues through an evolving &#65533;specular&#65533; lens. Luce Irigaray&#65533;s philosophy of the feminine and her deconstructing and reconstructing of psychoanalytic structures for women inform my work. Michel Foucault&#65533;s genealogical approach to analysing discourses is a powerful tool for exploring the history of the creation of the nurse and offers critical insights in to how nursing is perceived today. Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#65533;s phenomenology provides the flesh for my discussions about the embodied practice of nurses as beings in the world.
	Nursing&#65533;s struggle for recognition is ongoing. I discuss strategies that nurses could use to make themselves more &#65533;visible&#65533; in healthcare structures. The exploration of the embodied self of the nurse and through this the embodied knowledge of nursing is nascent. I hope to provide for nurses some food for both thought and discussion.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">professional recognition</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.183802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School based assessment within a standards based assessment regime : a mathematics community&#65533;s perspective</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Robert K.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a project with the overarching aim of exploring the role of School Based Assessment (SBA) in mathematics as a component alongside external written examinations for qualifications. The research was carried out in New Zealand during the implementation of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). The NCEA was implemented in 2002. The NCEA is targeted at three levels: Level 1 for Year 11 (fifth form) to replace the School Certificate Examinations (SC); Level 2 for Year 12 (sixth form) to replace Sixth Form Certificate Examinations (SFC) and; Level 3 for Year 13 (seventh form) to replace University Bursaries (UB). The NCEA uses standards based methods of assessment as opposed to its predecessors (SC, SFC, and UB) which used norm referenced methods of assessment. The examination at each level is divided into internal and external assessments. The internal assessment called Internal Achievement Standards (assessed by teachers in schools) is an SBA component. It is this component of the NCEA Level 1 examination which formed the focus of the study. A qualitative approach was used in the research through interviews, school visits part of which involved participant observation in assessment situations, and participant observations at professional development (PD) workshops for teachers. Four different groups of participants were interviewed for this research: policy-makers at the New Zealand Ministry of Education (MoE) and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA), The Mathematics Expert Panel, the facilitators of professional development (PD) workshops for teachers, and teachers of NCEA Level 1 mathematics. A total of 58 persons were interviewed. The perspective of each of these groups was necessary since each group had its specific role to play in the implementation of the NCEA. The policy-makers were asked to articulate the rationale for the SBA component of the NCEA. The Mathematics Expert Panel, which had decided on the areas of the secondary school mathematics best suited for SBA were asked to explain how this was done. The facilitators of the PD workshops recounted their experiences as they facilitated the teachers on how to assess against standards. Teachers who had the role of practical implementation were asked to articulate what they thought the rationale for an SBA was. They were also asked about the issues they confronted and the challenges they faced as they were introduced to a new regime of assessment. Both policy-makers and teachers are agreed that the rationale for an SBA component is to assess those objectives of the curriculum which are not appropriately, adequately and validly assessed in an external examination. A Framework was developed to gauge suitability of topics in the secondary school&#65533;s curriculum for SBA. The topics of the secondary curriculum found to be best suited for SBA are some parts of Geometry and Trigonometry, Measurement, and Statistics and Probability. The findings of this research provide adequate evidence that SBA has the potential for making a wider range of the school mathematics curriculum open to assessment. School Based Assessment also has the potential to get teachers at the secondary level to use pedagogical approaches that they rarely use when they teach for external examinations only. Facilitators of the PD workshops and the teachers of NCEA mathematics were of the opinion that the NCEA was too hurriedly implemented. Teachers confronted many teething problems and had many concerns during the first year of implementation. However, after three years, most of the teachers believe that the concerns they had during the first year are no longer issues for worry. There are implications for education systems wishing to implement innovative ideas that place heavy demands on teachers. The results here suggest that teachers need time before they are expected to change their normal manner of doing things in school. If adequate time is given at the initial stages then the process become a bit less hectic for them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Certificate of Educational Achievement</field><field name="subject">NCEA</field><field name="subject">eduational tests and measurements</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">education standards</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20060516.112442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of abdominal aortic aneurysms</field><field name="creator">Rossaak, Jeremy Ian</field><field name="description">Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are amongst the top ten most common cause of death in those over 55 years of age. The disease is usually asymptomatic, often being diagnosed incidentally. Once diagnosed, elective repair of an AAA results in excellent long-term survival with a 3-5% operative mortality. However, up to one half of patients present with ruptured aneurysms, a complication that carries an 80% mortality in the community, and of those reaching hospital, a 50% mortality. Clearly early diagnosis and treatment results in improved survival. Screening for AAA, with ultrasound, would detect aneurysms early, prior to rupture. However, debate continues over the cost effectiveness of population based screening programmes. The identification of a sub-population at a higher risk of developing AAA would increase the yield of a screening prograrmne. A number of populations have been examined, none of which have received international acceptance. About 20% of patients with an AAA have a family history of an aneurysm. The disease is also considered to be a disease of Caucasians, both facts suggesting a strong genetic component to the disease. Perhaps a genetically identified sub-population at a high risk of developing an AAA would prove to be an ideal population for screening. This thesis examines the incidence of aneurysms and the family histories of patients with AAA in the Otago region of New Zealand. Almost twenty percent of the population has a family history of AAA. DNA was collected from each of these patients for genetic analysis. The population was divided into familial AAA and non-familial AAA for the purpose of genetic analysis and compared to a control population. AAA is believed to be a disease of Caucasians; a non-Caucasian population with a low incidence of AAA may prove to be a good control population for genetic studies. A literature review demonstrated a higher incidence of AAA in Caucasians than other ethnic groups and within Caucasians a higher incidence in patients of Northern European origin. The incidence was low in Asian communities, even in studies involving of migrant Asian populations. The New Zealand Maori are believed to have originated from South East Asia, therefore could be expected to have a low incidence of AAA and would make an ideal control population for genetic studies. A pilot study was undertaken to examine the incidence of AAA in the New Zealand Maori. The age standardised incidence of AAA proved to be at least equal in Maori to non-Maori, with a more aggressive form of the disease in Maori, manifesting with a younger age at presentation and a higher incidence of ruptured aneurysms at diagnosis.

Far from being merely a form of selfdefense, pencak silat is a pedagogic method that seeks to embody particular cultural and social ideals within the body of the practitioner. The history, culture and practice ofpencak in West Java is the subject of this study.

As a form of traditional education, a performance art, a component of ritual and community celebrations, a practical form of self-defense, a path to spiritual enlightenment, and more recently as a national and international sport, pencak silat is in many respects unique. It is both an integrative and diverse cultural practice that articulates a holistic perspective on the world centering upon the importance of the body as a psychosomatic whole.

Changing socio-cultural conditions in Indonesia have produced new forms of pencak silat. Increasing government intervention in pencak silat throughout the New Order period has led to the development of nationalized versions that seek to inculcate state-approved values within the body of the practitioner. Pencak silat groups have also been mobilized for the purpose of pursuing political aims. Some practitioners have responded by looking inwards, outlining a path to self-realization framed by the powers, flows and desires found within the body itself. Others have developed styles that reflect the demands made upon them by their immediate environment.

Viewed historically these changes in the practice of pencak silat provides insights into the impact of broader processes of social and cultural change at the level of individual bodies and the institutions through which they are constructed; a politics of the body, its potentialities, limits and &#145;legitimate&#146; use.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">martial arts</field><field name="subject">silat</field><field name="subject">anthropology of the body</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040210.100853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural fluency for young children with autism</field><field name="creator">drbonser@starwon.com.au</field><field name="description">Fluency is functionally defined by: skill retention after a period without practice; skill endurance over longer intervals than encountered during practice; skill stability in the face of distraction; a performance that can be effortlessly applied to new environments; and a skill that adduces easily with other skills to form new repertoires (RESAA). Precision Teachers have found that fluency can be promoted by building the frequency of an accurate response to high rates. 

Young children with autism often fail to achieve RESAA outcomes from accuracy-based discrete trial training and may benefit from frequency-building instruction. However, a lack of published empirical support has meant that many behavioural educators have resisted adopting these strategies. The purpose of the current study was to determine if frequency-building procedures will promote the fluent skill development of tasks encountered on many early intervention programs for 12 young children with autism. 

The data showed that imitation, line tracing, drawing, simple addition, and phoneme reading skills taught to young children with autism achieved RESAA outcomes and responded to frequency building procedures in ways that were consistent with non-autistic populations. Secondly, frequency-building imitation to a rate-based fluency aim produced far greater gains on measures of generalised, imitation than using discrete trial training to an accuracy-based mastery criterion alone. Thirdly, increases in the rate of performance under frequency-building conditions positively predicted increases in the quality and quantity of applications, adductions, and skill generalisation for most skills. Fourthly, more exemplars are preferable to few during frequency-building practice. Fifthly, gross motor imitation, a controlled-operant task by definition, was modified and practiced to rates high enough to achieve RESAA criteria. Finally, discrete trial training was as effective as frequency-building when matched for reinforcement and practice, however was less efficient and rated less enjoyable by 5 children without developmental disabilities. 

The findings were consistent with behavioural fluency predictions and support the inclusion of frequency building strategies to promote skill fluency for young children with autism.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluency</field><field name="subject">autism</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">generalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040210.104430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Researching Sustainability: Material Semiotics and the Oil Mallee Project</field><field name="creator">sbell@orange.usyd.edu.au</field><field name="description">Sustainability responds to crises of ecology and human development and the relationships between them. Sustainability cannot be adequately described using disciplinary categories arising from the modern dichotomy between nature and culture. Sustainability research requires a methodology that reflects the reality of its subject.

This thesis presents material semiotics as a methodology for sustainability research. Material semiotics refers to the work of actor-network theorists and latter developments of alternate spatial metaphors for material relationality. Actor-network theory is a methodology that describes human and non-human actors in the same terms. It follows actor through networks of material relationships that they constitute and are constituted by, depicting heterogeneous objects without recourse to prior categories of nature or culture. The description of material relationships in fluid and regional, as well as network, spaces expands the descriptive power of material semiotics to include Others and to better represent complexity.

The Oil Mallee Project is a case study of sustainability in the Western Australian wheatbelt. Indigenous eucalypts, oil mallees, are planted on land that was cleared for agriculture. The above ground biomass can be processed for eucalyptus oil, electricity and activated carbon, and the rights to carbon stored in the extensive mallee roots, or in unharvested trees, can be sold. The Project responds to a number of sustainability issues, including ozone depletion, land degradation, climate change and rural decline. This thesis follows the actors that comprise the Oil Mallee Project to describe its complexity, multiplicity and sustainability. Qualitative interviews with actors in the Project and the wheatbelt provided the primary data, which is supported by documentary material.

Three contingent phases can be identified in the history of the Oil Mallee Project &#150; eucalyptus oil industry, dryland salinity management, and greenhouse response. The Project has persisted because it is simultaneously a regional, network and fluid object. Mallees grow well in the tough conditions of the wheatbelt. Mallees can be integrated with existing networks of industrial agriculture. The Project has achieved contingent stability in policy documents and the networks of scientific research. The fluidity of the Project has enabled it to change shape and identity in response to threats and opportunities, and as relationships break and form, without complete disruption. Specific humans have been central heroes in different phases of the Project. The mallees themselves are the only actors that have been consistently central to the identity of the Project.

Sustainability requires knowledge of the relationships between humans and non-humans that constitute the multiple crises of ecology and human development. Sustainability is the re-ordering of those relationships in ways that make possible ecological integrity and human fulfilment. Material semiotics is a methodology for knowing sustainability in ways that reveal the possibilities for such re-orderings.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">actor network theory</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">oil mallee</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040302.153647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shift Work: An Occupational Health and Safety Hazard</field><field name="creator">buxtons@senet.com.au</field><field name="description">Shift work is a major feature of modern work practices. It involves individuals working at times considered unconventional for most workers, such as at night. Although the community often benefits from such work practices, shift work can be hazardous, for both the workers and the community. 

The thesis reviews the main problems of shift work, especially when involving night work. These are: an increased risk for accidents and errors; increased sleepiness and fatigue due to difficulties sleeping; increased health problems; and disruption to family and social life. Strategies to limit the risk associated with these hazards are also reviewed, and include using knowledge of circadian principles to plan shift schedules, sleeping schedules and meal times; planned napping; consideration of the work environment; and newer techniques such as using bright lights and melatonin. 

While this information is known to the research community, it has not filtered down to many shift work workplaces and thus has had little if any positive effect on actual shift work practices. For a change in shift work practices to occur, the research knowledge must become available to every shift work workplace, as must some incentive or motivation to ensure that workplaces make the necessary changes. 

The Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws provide such a framework. Considering shift work as an OHS hazard would ensure that all shift work workplaces identified the hazards of shift work, conducted a risk assessment to identify the risk associated with the hazards, and then implemented the appropriate strategies, from the hierarchy of shift work hazard control measures, for both employers and employees, to fulfil their duty of care to minimise the risks. Considering shift work as an OHS issue would ensure that the research information was used as intended &#150; to improve the safety, performance, and quality of life of all shift workers. The present thesis reviews the shift work research and introduces an OHS perspective as a method to manage shift work effectively.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shift work</field><field name="subject">Occupational Health and Safety</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040302.154645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crazy, Sad Or Just Different:Evolving Representations Of Mental Illness And The Mentally Ill During Psychology Education.</field><field name="creator">helen.correia@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Mental illness is an issue of concern to the general community, and is a major focus of professions such as psychology. Such professions demand extensive education and training, with the aim to develop a scientific understanding of mental illness that is portrayed in contrast to socially shared knowledge, or social representations. However, some aspects of these social representations may persist in conjunction with the development of scientific knowledge. The current study used a multimethodological approach to elucidate how such
social representations may be transformed or modified by relevant education in psychology.

Psychology students, non-psychology students and clinical psychologists participated in the current study to assess groups at different levels of psychology education and training. Four forms of data collection were used as part of a multimethodological approach. Intraindividual
methods focused on the use of repertory grids and word associations to explore responses to the mentally ill as well as other relevant individuals such as the physically ill and mental health professionals. Inter-individual methods focused on social interaction in response to a case vignette of an individual with a mental disorder and group discussion within the educational setting.

Several core themes described in previous research were identified consistently across different groups and different methodologies. Negative emotion, such as distress and sadness, impaired functioning, and the need for assistance were commonly used as indicators of mental health problems. One of the most prominent themes, however, was the notion of difference and distance. The mentally ill person was consistently differentiated,
particularly from the self, even when the label of mentally ill was not imposed. The importance of the self was especially evident, acting as a means to define normality and difference.

Several differences were also noticeable between different levels of education. A changing representation was evident from understandings of the mentally ill as crazy, viewed in a more stereotypical, negative and critical light, to representations of the mentally ill as sad, typified by greater sympathy. Social representations may therefore influence the social response to the mentally ill. Increasing education associated with scientific understandings was also characterised by exclusive technical discourse, a feature that may distance the
psychologist from the general community.

These findings are particularly relevant to how education affects social representations of mental illness and the mentally ill, as public campaigns seek to change community attitudes and understandings. In addition, there are particular implications for psychologists, in training or at work. While a primary goal for the psychologist is to empathise and connect with the individuals they are intending to assist, the emphasis on difference, in both social and scientific understandings of the mentally ill, may act as a barrier. The education and professional development of psychologists should incorporate an understanding of how such representations may influence professional practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental illness</field><field name="subject">social representations</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040302.161013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of two species of sparid on the west coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">ahesp@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Various aspects of the biology of the tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba and western yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus latus were studied. The studies on R. sarba have focused on populations in temperate coastal marine waters at ca 32oS and the lower reaches of an estuary (Swan River Estuary) located at the same latitude and in a subtropical embayment (Shark Bay) at ca 26oS, while those on A. latus were conducted on the population in the latter embayment.

A combination of a macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads demonstrated that R. sarba is typically a rudimentary hermaphrodite in Western Australian waters, i.e. the juveniles develop into either a male or female in which the ovarian and testicular zones of the gonads, respectively, are macroscopically undetectable. This contrasts with the situation in the waters off Hong Kong and South Africa, in which R. sarba is reported to be a protandrous hermaphrodite. However, it is possible that a few of the fish that are above the size at first maturity and possess, during the spawning period, ovotestes with relatively substantial amounts of both mature testicular and immature ovarian tissue, could function as males early in adult life and then change to females. Although R. sarba spawns at some time between late winter and late spring in Western Australia, spawning peaks later in the Swan River Estuary than in coastal, marine waters at the same latitude and Shark Bay, in which salinities are always close to or above that of full strength sea water, i.e. 35 &#129;&#241; . While the males and females attain sexual maturity at very similar lengths in the Swan River Estuary and Shark Bay, i.e. L50s all between 170 and 177 mm, they typically reach maturity at an earlier age in the former environment, i.e. 2 vs 3 years old. Thus, length and consequently growth rate influence the timing of maturity rather than age. During the spawning period, only 9 % of the fish caught between 180 and 260 mm in nearshore, shallow marine waters had become mature, whereas 91 % of those in this length range over reefs were mature, indicating that R. sarba tends to move offshore only when it has become &#129;gphysiologically ready to mature. The L50s at first maturity indicate that the current minimum legal length in Western Australia (230 mm) is appropriate for managing this species.

Oocyte diameter frequency distributions, stages in oocyte development, duration of oocyte hydration and time of formation of post-ovulatory follicles in mature ovaries of Rhabdosargus sarba in the lower Swan River Estuary (32o 03&#129;fS, 115o 44&#129;fE) were used, in conjunction with data on tidal cycles, to elucidate specific aspects of the reproductive biology of this sparid in an estuarine environment. The results demonstrated the following. (i) Rhabdosargus sarba has indeterminate fecundity sensu Hunter et al. (1985). (ii) Oocyte hydration commences at about dusk (18:30 h) and is completed by ca 01:30-04:30 h, at which time ovulation, as revealed by the presence of hydrated oocytes in the ovarian duct and appearance of newlyformed post-ovulatory follicles, commences. (iii) The prevalence of spawning was positively correlated with tidal strength and was greatest on days when the tide changed from flood to ebb at ca 06:00 h, i.e. approximately when spawning ceases. Spawning just prior to strong ebb tides would lead to the transport of eggs out of the estuary and thus into salinities that remain at ca 35 &#129;&#241; . The likelihood of eggs being transported downstream is further enhanced by R. sarba spawning in deeper waters in the estuary, where the flow is greatest. (iv) Although mature ovaries were found in R. sarba in the estuary between early July and December, the prevalence of atretic oocytes was high until September, when salinities started rising markedly from their winter minima. Batch fecundities ranged from 2,416 for a 188 mm fish to 53,707 for a 266 mm fish. The average daily prevalence of spawning amongst mature females during the spawning period of R. sarba caught in the lower estuary, i.e. July to end of October, was 36.5 %. Thus, individual female R. sarba spawned, on average, at intervals of ca 2.7 days in each spawning season. Female R. sarba with total lengths of 200, 250 and 300 mm were estimated to have a batch fecundity of 7,400, 20,100 and 54,800 eggs, respectively and annual fecundities of 332,000, 903,000 and 2,461,000 eggs, respectively.

Rhabdosargus sarba is shown to undergo size-related movements in each of the three very different environments in which it was studied. In temperate coastal waters, R. sarba settles in unvegetated nearshore areas and then moves progressively firstly to nearby seagrass beds and then to exposed unvegetated nearshore areas and finally to areas around reefs where spawning occurs. Although R. sarba spawns in the lower Swan River Estuary, relatively few of its early 0+ recruits remain in the estuary and substantial numbers of this species do not start reappearing in the estuary until they are ca 140 mm. In Shark Bay, R. sarba uses nearshore mangroves as a nursery area and later moves into areas around reefs. The maximum ages recorded for R. sarba in coastal marine waters (11 years) and Shark Bay (13 years) were far greater than in the lower Swan River Estuary (6 years). However, the maximum lengths recorded in these three environments were all ca 350 mm. Due to the production by size-related movements of differences amongst the lengths of R. sarba at given ages in different habitats in coastal marine waters, the composite suite of lengths at age was not fully representative of the population of this species as a whole in this environment. A von Bertalanffy growth curve, which was adjusted to take into account size related changes in habitat type, significantly improved the fit to the lengths at age of individuals in the composite samples for the population beyond that provided by the unadjusted von Bertalanffy growth curve. This resulted in the maximum difference between the estimates of length at age from the two growth curves, relative to the L&#129;&#135; derived from the unadjusted von Bertalanffy curve, reaching a value equivalent to 8 %. However, the maximum differences for the corresponding curves for populations in the lower Swan River Estuary and Shark Bay were far less, i.e. 1.7 and 3.2 %, respectively, and thus not considered biologically significant. Rhabdosargus sarba grew slightly faster in the lower Swan River Estuary than in either coastal marine waters or Shark Bay, possibly reflecting the greater productivity of estuarine environments.

Acanthopagrus latus is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Detailed macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads of a wide size range of fish, together with a quantification of how the prevalences of the different categories of gonad change with size and age and during the year, were used to elucidate the sequence of changes that occur in the ovotestes of A. latus during life. The scheme proposed in the present study for the protandrous changes in A. latus differed from those proposed for this species elsewhere, but was similar to that of Pollock (1985) for the congeneric Acanthopagrus australis. The ovotestes of functional males develop from gonads which, as in older juveniles, contain substantial amounts of testicular and ovarian tissue. Such ovotestes, and particularly their testicular component, regress markedly after spawning and then, during the next spawning season, either again become ovotestes in which the testicular zone predominates and contains spermatids and spermatozoa (functional males), or become ovotestes in which the ovarian zone predominates and contains vitellogenic oocytes (functional females). Once a fish has become a functional female, it remains a female throughout the rest of its life. The trends exhibited during the year by reproductive variables demonstrate that A. latus in Shark Bay typically spawns on a very limited number of occasions during a short period in August and September and has determinate fecundity. The potential annual fecundities of 24 A. latus ranged from 764,000 in a 600 g fish to 7,910,000 in a 2,050 g fish and produced a mean &#129;}1SE of 1,935,000 &#129;} 281,000. The total length at which 50 % of A. latus become identifiable as males (245 mm) is very similar to the current minimum legal length (MLL) of 250 mm, which corresponds to an age of 2.5 years less than the age at which 50 % of males become females. Current spawning potential ratios calculated over a range of alternative values for natural mortality (M) for A. latus in Shark Bay suggests that the present fishing pressure is sustainable, but that the current MLL should be reviewed if recreational fishing pressure continues to increase.

The age composition and von Bertalanffy growth parameters for Acanthopagrus latus have been determined. The relevant parameters were inserted into the empirical equations of Pauly (1980) and Ralston (1987) for estimating natural mortality (M). Total mortality (Z) was calculated using Hoenig&#129;fs (1983) equations, relative abundance analysis and a simulation based on maximum age and sample size.The two point estimates for M for A. latus, which were both 0.70 year-1, greatly exceeded all estimates for Z (range 0.18 to 0.30 year-1), which is clearly an erroneous result. To resolve this problem of inconsistent estimates, a Bayesian approach was developed, which, through combining the likelihood distributions of the various mortality estimates, produced integrated estimates for M and Z that are more consistent and precise than those produced for these two variables using the above methods individually. This approach now yielded lower values for M than Z and a measure of fishing mortality that appears to be consistent with the current status of the fishery. This approach is equally applicable to other fish species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tarwhine</field><field name="subject">Rhabdosargus sarba</field><field name="subject">western yellowfin bream</field><field name="subject">Acanthopagrus latus</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040302.162906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Discourse of Weight Control and the Self</field><field name="creator">dldavies@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an exploration of the discourse of weight control and examines how its concepts and goals are incorporated into the way people perceive and
understand the self and others. The central focus is an analysis of the nexus between weight control and concerns surrounding &#145;excess&#146; weight. The analysis reveals the way discourses on the balanced body, the normalised body, the
healthy body, the natural body and the transformative body generate varying understandings of the normal, weight-controlled body and overweight body and in turn, how they give rise to different weight watching practices. It shows how the different ways of viewing the body also engender various visualisations of the subjects of weight control. It is argued the discourse of weight control is not
put into effect by subjugation but through the generation of a personal desire to be slender and weight-controlled. As such, the central inquiry of the thesis also
gives consideration to the impacts which discourses of weight control might have upon individuals in the constitution of self and identity. A sub-theme of the
analysis is a consideration of the possibilities people have to engage with the discourse of weight control, in particular those who are considered overweight.
Particular attention is paid throughout to the relationship between women and weight control. The findings are predominantly based upon content analysis of a
broad range of primary texts including medico-scientific texts, historical material, policy and public health documents, and popular written and audiovisual
media. The research is also informed to a less extent by participant observation at two weight loss centres and by semi-structured in-depth interviews with 13 women considered &#145;overweight&#146; by current standards.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weight</field><field name="subject">overweight</field><field name="subject">fat</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040303.153523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting on Continuity and Discontinuity in &#147;The Law&#148;. An Application of Foucault&#146;s Archaeological Method in a Reading of Judicial Decisions in Negligence</field><field name="creator">c.dent@unimelb.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is a tentative application of Foucault&#146;s archaeological method to the English common law. The project is an attempt at explaining and demonstrating the specific attributes of the method in terms of a contribution to an understanding of the law as both continuous and discontinuous.

From the understanding applied in this thesis, an application of the archaeological method requires a careful examination of the monuments of a discourse. The monuments that are examined in this project are a number of negligence law judgments. The authors of the monuments are seen as the sum of the practices that constitute them. That is, in this application of the method to the law, the judges are not considered as authors, instead, the judgments they write are seen as reflecting the practices of the legal discourse.

The most fundamental of these discursive practices, from the perspective applied in this thesis is the repetition of past legal statements in the production of judgments. In the understanding of law adopted in this project, cases are treated as sites within which judges choose from a number of possible legal statements made by preceding judges. The common law, then, is seen as representing a process in which statements by particular judges in specific cases are valorised, primarily through repetition, until the alternative utterances are largely, but never completely, excluded.

The application of the archaeological method to these negligence decisions demonstrates the operation of the discursive practice of repetition. The application provides a framework for appreciating the way in which the law can change without losing its continuity and legitimacy. The project examines cases between 1750 and 1972 and demonstrates that, despite apparently radical changes in the articulations of liability, from the writ system to the duty of care, the law has maintained its structure through the reproduction of the discursive practices that constitute members of the legal profession.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">archaelogy</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">negligence</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040303.161038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental Education In The Workplace: Inducing voluntary transport behaviour change to decrease single occupant vehicle trips by commuters into the Perth CBD.</field><field name="creator">c.baudains@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As populations increase and air quality continues to decline in many cities around the world, there is growing recognition that human dependency on car based transport is a serious pollution issue. The potential exists to  change this aspect of human behaviour using environmental education to develop more sustainable transport practices. The application of education strategies to achieve behaviour change in transport mode choice may benefit from an interdisciplinary approach.

This research examined the effectiveness of three different educational strategies in a workplace situation in achieving a shift in transport mode away from the single occupant vehicle. This research aimed to determine if workplace based education interventions that stimulate a deeper level of learning, and encourage self-regulated learning and reflective practice, are more likely to achieve positive behaviour change than interventions based on more superficial learning. A secondary aim was to determine if the characteristics or type of workplace influence the effectiveness of particular education strategies. The research focuses specifically on people&#146;s perceptions of transport behaviour and air pollution.

The research examined the effectiveness of three workplace based interventions which aimed at reducing the use of single occupant vehicles (SOV) for commuting to work resulting in an increase in the use of green transport (alternatives to the SOV). The primary goal of the three educational interventions was to achieve an increased awareness, development of positive attitudes and increased empowerment regarding sustainable transport choices. Based on a combination of environmental education and self-regulation of learning theory it was theorized that achieving the three afore mentioned educational outcomes would be highly likely to result in a change in behaviour.

The three interventions differ in level of participant involvement, while the information and structure of each intervention was controlled as much as is possible in a naturalistic study. The intervention designs were based on educational theories including cognitivist information processing, Vygotskian/social constructivism, and self-regulation of learning. The first intervention provided information to participants impersonally with no additional support. The second intervention incorporated a volunteer to model pro-environmental behaviour, facilitate discussion of issues, and aid in planning commute trips using alternatives to the single occupant vehicle. The
third intervention included the formation of a green transport planning group within the workplace which aimed to identify and address barriers to using alternative transport in the workplace through the development of a green transport plan.

In the naturalistic workplace setting, mixed methodologies(qualitative and quantitative) were employed to examine the relative effectiveness of the three interventions in terms of participants knowledge about, attitudes towards and behaviour (action) in regard to transport, as well as changes at an organizational level. Multiple case studies and surveys were used to collect data about employee transport behaviour, attitudes, and knowledge in 13 workplaces situated in the central area of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, before and after a period of intervention. To allow comparability between workplaces in terms of organisational structure and function six of the 13 workplaces were selected to examine in detail,one government and one engineering organization in each of the three intervention groups.

It was found that the level of knowledge about car use and air quality was increased in all three intervention groups, suggesting increased involvement does not improve the chance of increasing knowledge. In contrast, significantly more positive attitudes to car use and air quality issues were developed in only the two most involving interventions, suggesting information distribution alone is unlikely to influence attitude. There were no changes in the general environmental attitudes across the intervention groups. Single occupant vehicle trips were significantly reduced in the second intervention group only. An overall significant increase was reported for self efficacy (as a measure of empowerment) but no significant change was reported for any particular intervention group. At an organizational level the third intervention resulted in the greatest organizational change, and it is likely that the measures implemented as a result of the green transport planning process will have an ongoing impact on employee transport behaviour in the participant workplaces.

The effectiveness of each intervention type also varied between workplaces. Structural factors such as design of the work environment, internal mail and email systems, and work hours influenced the delivery of the interventions in some workplaces and qualitative data indicates this may have influenced success. There was also an indication that management involvement and workplace culture were major factors influencing participant perceptions of effectiveness of particular education strategies.

Overall it is concluded that while the second intervention involving leadership (but without participant ownership) achieved the greatest reduction in use of the single occupant vehicle, the third intervention achieved the greatest long-term impact on participants and organizations. As a result the definition of effectiveness is complicated and is dependant on whether preferred outcomes have a short-term or a long-term focus. These findings have implications for the way in which achieving sustainable transport in metropolitan areas is approached, as well as other environmentally sustainable behaviours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">car based transport</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040310.121357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Civic Environmental Pragmatism: A Dialogical Framework for Strategic Environmental Assessment</field><field name="creator">T.Wallington@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Questions of uncertainty and value conflict are increasingly pervasive challenges confronting policy makers seeking to address the range of environmental problems generated by contemporary technological systems. Yet these questions are ultimately political and moral in nature, and require a framework of strategic environmental
assessment (SEA) that is marked by informed and democratic civic governance. Reflecting this, the original, civic purposes of environmental assessment (EA) embraced science and public participation as interdependent elements in the creation of more sustaining forms of human-nature interaction. 

However, formal models of EA have forsaken meaningful democratic engagement to technique. Based on the instrumentalist assumption that better science automatically leads to better policy, EA has externalised the civic source of political energy that underpins its environmental expertise. Moreover, debates become polarised when science is uncritically imported into the adversarial forums of interest-based politics,so that environmental science is increasingly unable to support political action. I shall argue that the revolutionary potential of SEA to transform the policy process rests upon a recovery of its original, civic purposes. 

My thesis is that a deeper understanding of the relationship between scientific knowledge and political action is required if SEA is to be rigorous, and also relevant to public concerns. Philosophical pragmatism contributes epistemological resources vital to this task. By situating knowledge in the context of practice, and by recognising the dialogical, judgmental nature of rationality, the practical philosophy of pragmatism reclaims the contextually embedded nature of inquiry. When science is embedded in a wider ethical context, the meaning and purposes of environmental knowledge become central questions of policy. 

The procedural ethics of both liberal and Habermasian politics cannot address these questions, however, because they relegate questions of the public good to the realm of individual choice. Instead, I argue that public dialogue, guided by a praxisoriented virtue ethics, is required to recover objective environmental goods in the policy process. I also argue that Aristotlean rhetoric, with its focus on the credibility of expertise, is the mode of persuasive argument most appropriate for dialogical public forums. The public philosophy of civic environmental pragmatism is therefore presented as a richer theoretical framework for understanding the contribution of both experts and citizens in the development of environmental knowledge for policy. As a dialogical framework for SEA, civic environmental pragmatism constructively combines the critical/normative and instrumental/descriptive aspects of policy inquiry, both of which are required in the development of socially robust knowledge and politically feasible policy decisions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pragmatism</field><field name="subject">deliberative democracy</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="subject">environmental assessment</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040428.144248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can Tidal Power Promote Sustainable Integrated Coastal Development in Bangladesh?</field><field name="creator">Salek@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Tidal power is a clean renewable energy. Furthermore, electricity is acknowledged as a key need for development. However, until recently, due to high capital costs and extensive environmental concerns, few tidal power plants are operative around the world. These problems are now being mitigated by the application of appropriate, modern practices and technologies. In particular the use of small scale technologies, innovative financing and the involvement of local communities creates the potential  for tidal power to be a tool in coastal development. This thesis examines the appropriateness of tidal power in the rural coastal community of Bangladesh, where electricity demand is a major development problem. Coastal Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially from cyclones, tidal surges and the effects of global warming on sea-level rise. 

Consequently, most of this coastal area has been protected by embankments and sluice gates, which can accommodate the normal tidal head rise and fall. The potential of tidal power to use this infrastructure, together with its associated problems and mitigation measures, have been analysed by comparing existing and potential tidal power technologies around the world, including a proposed Kimberley tidal power project in Western Australia. 

The research has identified that a significant amount of power could be produced from the tidal range of coastal Bangladesh by using the simple low-cost technology of tidal wheels in the tidal embankment sluice gates. The electricity produced could be utilised by various coastal interests, such as agriculture, shrimp aquaculture and other resource producing activities. However, the real benefits of this technology are that it can be applied in a way that simultaneously enables the development of local infrastructure and the improvement in living conditions of the local people by creating income generation and employment opportunities in these coastal communities. The thesis puts forward a community based co-management model as a means of effectively integrating tidal power in coastal area management in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tidal power</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">sustainable intergrated coastal development</field><field name="subject">participatory co-management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040428.151218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Psychology of Environmentally Sustainable Behaviour</field><field name="creator">tim.kurz@ncl.ac.uk</field><field name="description">Environmental sustainability has received increasing attention in both scientific and public life over the past 40 years. Almost all problems are the result of the behaviour of people. Hence, successful solutions to environmental problems must be social as well as technological. Psychology has offered a variety of theoretical approaches to understanding environmentally sustainable behaviour (ESB), including rationaleconomic, social dilemmas, attitude and behavioural models. A related psychological literature also exists regarding the ways in which ESBs may be promoted most effectively in the community.

The early chapters of this thesis provide a critical review of the major theoretical approaches in psychology to understanding ESB, as well as the ways in which the psychological literature has conceptualised applied intervention programs to promote ESB. 

It is suggested that a more holistic framework for conceptualising ESB is required which allows for the integration of the strengths of the variety of current approaches, and which also helps to understand their potential limitations. As such, a social-ecological framework is detailed that draws upon principles from both social and ecological psychology and has as its central tenet that ESBs should be conceptualised as the result of the ways in which members of a community interact with their environments. 

In particular, it is argued that people&#146;s ESBs will be influenced by the extent to which they perceive particular environmentally relevant objects as &#145;affording&#146; (Gibson, 1979) negative impact on the natural environment.

Two field experiments were conducted (a pilot and a larger main study) which aimed to apply the social-ecological framework to the promotion of water and energy consumption within a local community in the city of Perth, Western Australia. 

The results of both field experiments showed significant reductions in water consumption as a result of the installation around the home of labels that aimed to attune residents to the water consumption affordances of various appliances. The same effects were not, however, obtained from energy consumption labels. 

In light of these differential effects upon water and energy consumption, a third, qualitative, study was conducted to examine the potential differences in residents&#146; representations of these two resources and the ways in which residents constructed the use of these resources in their talk. A series of in-depth interviews was conducted with a sample of residents who had taken part in the main field experiment. These were analysed from the perspectives of social representations theory (Moscovici, 1984) and discursive psychology (Edwards &amp; Potter, 1992; Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987). 

This analysis revealed important differences in the ways in which these two resources were constructed. It also showed the ways in which community members were able to position themselves as responsible &#145;users&#146;, rather than &#145;wasters&#146; of resources, the importance of justice and equity in residents&#146; resources discourse, and the ways in which &#145;truth&#146; in the environmental domain is constructed and ascribed to certain groups.

The results of the field experiments and qualitative study together suggest that whilst attuning residents to the environmental impact affordances of relevant objects in their homes does affect their ESBs, this process can not be separated from the influence of the social environment in which these behaviours are embedded. It is also argued that such social environmental influences may be best understood in terms of the linguistic devices that members of a particular society have at their disposal to explain and legitimate their behaviour. 

The major conclusion of the thesis is that attempts to investigate and promote environmentally sustainable behaviour should utilise multiple understandings from the social sciences, rather than remaining wedded to any one particular theoretical or methodological approach. The social-ecological framework that has guided the theoretical and practical work contained in this thesis represents an attempt at such integration. The implications of the findings for public policy efforts to promote ESB are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040428.152013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Questions of Popular Cult(ure)</field><field name="creator">LMcrae@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">Questions of Popular Cult(ure) works in the uncomfortable and unclear spaces of popular culture. This thesis demonstrates how cult cauterizes ambiguity and functions as a framing agent for unpopular politics in popular culture. In tracking the flows and hesitations in the postwar period through the rise of the New Right and identity politics, this thesis shows how cult contains moving and malleable meanings that maneuver through everyday life. It is a slippery and slight subject that denies coherent categorization in definitional frames. 

This thesis negotiates this liminality by tracking broad social shifts in race, class and gender through textualised traces. The complicated concept of cult is activated within a series of case studies. These chapters are linked together to demonstrate the volatile variance of the cult category.

Section one contextualises the terrain of the intellectual work in this thesis. It paints broad brush-strokes of the postwar period, through an animated intersection of politics and popular culture. The first chapter defines the currency of cult in contemporary times. It is devoted to investigating the relationships between colonisation and popular culture. By pondering postcolonialism, this chapter prises open thirdspace to consider how writing and madness performs proximity in the pre and post-colonial world. The &#145;maddening&#146; of cargo cults by colonisers in Melanesia operates as a metonym for the regulation of marginal modalities of resistance. In popular culture, this trajectory of insane otherness has corroded, with the subversion of cult being appropriated by fan discourses, as worship has become &#145;accountable&#146; for the mainstream market.

Chapter two unpacks The X-Files as a text tracking the broad changes in politics through popular culture. This innovative text has moved from marginality into the mainstream, mapping meanings through the social landscape. Consciousness and reflexivity in the popular embeds this text in a cult framework, as it demonstrates the movement in meanings and the hegemonic hesitations of the dominant in colonising (and rewriting) the interests of the subordinate as their own.

Section two creates a dialogue between gendered politics and contemporary popular culture. The changes to the consciousness in masculinity and femininity are captured by Tank Girl, Tomb Raider, Henry Rollins and Spike (from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer). These texts perform the wavering popularity of feminism and the ascent of men&#146;s studies in intellectual inquiry. Tank Girl articulates unpopular feminist politics through the popular mode of film. The movement to more mainstream feminism is threaded through the third wave embraced by Tomb Raider that reinscribes the popular paradigms of femininity, via colonisation. The computer game discourse permits a pedagogy of power to punctuate Lara Croft&#146;s virtual surfaces and shimmer through the past into the present.

Tracking this historical movement, two chapters on masculinity brew the boom in men&#146;s studies&#146; questioning of manhood. Henry Rollins is a metonym for an excessive and visible masculinity, in an era where men have remained an unmarked centre of society. His place within peripheral punk performance settles his inversionary identity. Spike from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer demonstrates the contradictions in manhood by moving through the masculine hierarchy to deprioritise men in the public sphere. This is a mobile masculinity in a time where changeability has caused a &#145;crisis&#146; for men. Both these men embody a challenging and confrontational gender politics. Cult contains these characters within different spaces, at varying times and through contradictory politics.

Section three ponders the place and role of politics at its most persistent and relevant. It demonstrates the consequences for social justice in an era of New Right ideologies. The chapter on South Park mobilises Leftist concerns within an overtly Rightist context, and Trainspotting moves through youth politics and acceleration to articulate movement in resistive meanings. 

These case studies contemplate the journey of popular culture in the postwar period by returning to the present and to the dominant culture. The colonisation of identity politics by the New Right makes the place of cultural studies &#150; as a pedagogic formation - powerfully important. Colonisation of geographical peripheries is brought home to England as the colonisation of the Celtic fringe is interpreted through writing and resistance.

This thesis tracks (and connects) two broad movements - the shifting of political formations and the commodification of popular culture. The disconnecting dialogue between these two streams opens the terrain for cult. In the hesitations that delay their connection, cult is activated to cauterize this disjuncture.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040428.152619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising for Sustainable Natural Resource Management: Representation, Leadership and Partnerships at Four Spatial Scales</field><field name="creator">S.Rockloff@cqu.edu.au</field><field name="description">Sustainability of natural resources is currently a concern worldwide. The ecological and economic aspects of sustainability have received substantial research attention, but the social aspects of sustainability are less well understood. Participation by affected communities in natural resource management decisions is pivotal to social sustainability. As such, this study examined ten case studies of participation and decision-making by natural resource management groups involved in agriculture in the south-west of Australia. Groups at four spatial scales were studied, including the State, regional, land conservation district (Shire) and subcatchment.

Drawing on these ten case studies, this study analysed participation in these groups from the perspectives of representation, leadership and partnership. Crucial elements of this analysis included identifying the desirable attributes of participation in terms of achieving social sustainability, and then comparing current practice against these ideals.

The study concludes with comments about the efficacy at each spatial scale of current approaches to participation in terms of social sustainability. Central conclusions from this study follow. Some scales are performing better than others in terms of meeting the expectations expressed through the desirable criteria. The State scale is performing well, in terms of its mandate, with its lower expectations than those ascribed to regional and subcatchment scales clearly being met. On the other hand, the expectations associated with the community- and government-led regional groups and subcatchment groups are enormous. 

The only place where there was any major difference between the three was in representation: it was barely considered by respondents from the subcatchment groups, while for the regional groups less of the expectations were met by the community-led than government-led groups. Otherwise they were very similar. The land conservation districts, caught between the regions and subcatchments, seem to be faring the poorest.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="subject">scale</field><field name="subject">social sustainability</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040428.155151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Relationships between Individualism and Collectivism and Attitudes towards Counselling among Ethnic Chinese, Australian, and American University Students</field><field name="creator">psnider@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Exploring the Relationships Between Individualism and Collectivism and Attitudes Towards Counselling Among Ethnic Chinese, Australian, and American University Students Compensating for reduced public funding, Australian and American universities actively recruit full-fee paying East Asian international students. University staff, aware of international students having difficulties coping with cultural and emotional issues, often encourage them to seek university counselling services. However, East Asian international students under-utilise Western universities&#146; counselling services.

It has been argued that the Western concept of counselling reflects Western cultural values, in particular individualism. Thus the reluctance of international students from more collectivistic cultures to seek counselling services may in part be due to a clash of cultural values. Over a decade ago, Draguns hypothesised the existence of a relationship between Hofstede&#146;s cultural dimensions of individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, and their influence on individuals&#146; attitudes towards psychopathology and treatment modalities. The current study sought to offer empirical support for Draguns&#146; hypothesis as it related to individualism and power distance, and to attitudes towards counselling. In place of Hofstede&#146;s cultural dimensions, this study used the Triandis cultural concepts of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism.

Using the Triandis Individualism Collectivism Scale (ICS) and the Tinsley Expectations about Counseling-Brief Form (EAC-B)questionnaire, the current study explores the relationship between levels of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, and attitudes towards the roles of counsellors, the roles of clients, and the process and goals of counselling. The research is based on data collected from three cultural groups: ethnic Chinese international students attending Australian universities, and Australian and American university students enrolled in their home countries.

This study is unusual in cross-cultural research owing to its use of the Rasch extended logistic model of modern item response theory (IRT) as a means of validating the data prior to standard statistical analysis. Whereas classical test theory emphasises the model fitting the data, the Rasch model of IRT requires that the data fit the model to be considered valid. Psychometric analysis of the ICS found its four scales separately fit the Rasch model quite well, as did three modified scales of the EAC-B. 

The IRT analysis also provided a means of identifying differential item functioning (DIF), that is, items functioning differently (demonstrating bias) among
the three cultural groups.

Using the EAC-B to collect pre and post-intervention data, the current study assessed the effectiveness of a videotape intervention as a means of changing within and between-group attitudes towards counselling. It was anticipated that ethnic Chinese participants, representing the group with the least familiarity with counselling, would show the greatest change in counselling attitudes as a result of the intervention. Americans were expected to show the least change, and Australian participants to be in the middle position. Based on the findings, the intervention did not significantly alter the participants&#146; attitudes towards counselling regardless of their cultural background. Overall, the intervention served to strengthen existing attitudes.

Lastly as a means of gaining a deeper understanding of the quantitative findings, the study collected qualitative data from the participants and from university counsellors. These findings indicated that there was a general lack of knowledge about university counselling services even among those participants who were familiar with counselling as a concept. Participants, in general, expressed reservations about seeking counselling due to concerns of being seen by friends. This was particularly true for the Chinese. Chinese participants also expressed scepticism towards a non-Chinese counsellor&#146;s ability to understand their problems.

In reference to Draguns&#146; hypothesis, overall the findings from this study supported his model. The findings indicated that individuals endorsing collectivistic attitudes expressed a strong preference for counsellors who were direct, expert-like, and helped clients seek concrete solutions to their problems. The study also found that an individual&#146;s expressions of cultural dimensions, such as vertical collectivism, were better predictors of counsellor preference than an individual&#146;s cultural background.

These findings have implications for university policy makers who are responsible for ensuring the existence of an infrastructure capable of meeting the needs of the international students they so actively recruit. This would include appropriate funding for an adequate and diverse counselling staff extending itself to the university community. There are also implications for counsellor education programs in recognising the link between cultural variables and client expectations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross cultural counselling</field><field name="subject">individualism-collectivism</field><field name="subject">international students</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040430.140708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation status of aquatic insects in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">Karen Elizabeth Sutcliffe</field><field name="description">Freshwater ecosystems in south-western Australia have been extensively altered over the last two centuries as a result of human activities. The effect this has had on aquatic fauna, particularly invertebrates, is largely unknown because of inadequate knowledge of the pre-existing fauna. Future changes in the composition of aquatic fauna will also go undetected unless current distributions of existing species are well documented.

This thesis addresses the problem by investigating the current distributions and conservation status of aquatic insects in south-western Australia from three orders: Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Extensive distributional data was collected by identifying larval specimens from a large number of samples collected throughout the south-west as part of an Australia-wide macroinvertebrate bioassessment project. In addition, a database created from a species-level biological study of the wheatbelt region of Western Australia was utilised, and previously published records of occurrence for species within the south-west were compiled. These results were then used to assess the conservation status of each species using the IUCN red list criteria.

Environmental parameters measured at time of sampling were also examined using logistic regression to determine which factors are important in influencing the distributions of aquatic insects in south-western Australia. The conservation value of sites based on Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera compositions was also determined and the degree of protection provided for sites of high conservation value investigated.The high rainfall forested region of the south-west was found to be important for a large number of species, including the majority of those found to be rare and/or restricted.

Overall, 37% of species were found to be threatened, with the Trichoptera containing both the greatest number and highest proportion of threatened species. Logistic regression results generally agreed with the distributions obtained for each species, with rainfall and other parameters indicative of streams in the headwaters of forested catchments being positively associated with species found to be restricted to the high rainfall region. Two parameters known to be affected by human disturbance in the south-west, conductivity and nutrient concentrations, were found to be important in determining the occurrence of many species and this could have important consequences for aquatic insect conservation. Widespread species occurring within the low rainfall region of the south-west did not show as many significant relationships to measured environmental parameters, possibly due to their greater ecological tolerances and adaptations which allow them to persist in a low rainfall environment. The implications of results are discussed, and recommendations for the conservation and management of aquatic insects in south-western Australia are given.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">plecoptera</field><field name="subject">trichoptera</field><field name="subject">odonata</field><field name="subject">south-western australia</field><field name="subject">aquatic insects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040430.153605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unpicking the Semes: Power, Resistance, and the Internet</field><field name="creator">etay@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The Internet was a catalyst for refiguring the previous models of media relationships. For many, the Internet is a medium that liberates individuals from the centralised and asymmetrical power structures of traditional mass media and other social institutions in particular, the boundaries set by the nation and the state. For other people, the Internet increases the capacity for surveillance and control. This dissertation argues for a fluid conception of the operations of power and resistance on the Internet that takes into account the various discourses which play a part in determining agency and subjectivity.

It examines and balances the narratives of liberation and oppression against each other: for, just as the developments in Internet technology contribute to changes in discourse, so too existing or prior discursive limits and relations of power affect Internet culture and technology.

In the process of analysing the interplay of different discourses on the Internet, this dissertation takes into account transnational and national cultural flows and the insights that conceptual work on globalisation, transnationalism, and cosmopolitanism can provide. The case studies are concerned with change and centre on the use of the Internet to effect this change; they include: the Singaporean Internet, a &#145;thread&#146; about Asian culture and Australia, the representation of oppression and the formation of Chinese diasporic collectivities, and anti capitalist networks. Through these case studies, the dissertation examines the degree to which the nation-state can regulate and affect the discourses at play on the Internet as well as the agency of participants in countering and maintaining these discourses. This dissertation also analyses activists&#146; use of the Internet to form transnational networks. It discusses the limitations of their work including problems with representation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">interent</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040430.154253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxygen Management for Optimisation of Nitrogen Removal in a Sequencing Batch Reactor</field><field name="creator">kthird@witbo.nl</field><field name="description">In today&#146;s progressively urbanised society, there is an increasing need for cost-effective, environmentally sound technologies for the removal of nutrients (carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen) from polluted water. Nitrogen removal from wastewater is the focus of this thesis. 

Conventional nitrogen removal requires the two processes of aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification, which is driven by remaining reducing power. While most wastewaters contain a significant fraction of reducing power in the form of organic substrate, it is difficult to preserve the reducing power required for denitrification, due to the necessary preceding aerobic oxidation step. Consequently, one of the major limitations to complete N-removal in traditional wastewater treatment systems is the shortage of organic carbon substrate for the reduction of oxidised nitrogen (NO2-, NO3-), produced from nitrification. 

This thesis followed two main research themes that aimed to address the problem of organic carbon limitation in nitrogen removal from wastewater, by management of the oxygen supply. The first theme was the study of N-removal by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in the novel reactor type, the sequencing batch reactor (SBR). It was aimed to increase understanding of PHB metabolism and the limiting factors of SND and then to develop a suitable on-line control strategy to manage the oxygen supply and optimise nitrogen removal by SND. The second main research theme was the application of the  CANON(Completely Autotrophic Nitrogen-removal Over Nitrite) process for nitrogen removal from wastewater; a novel process that requires minimal oxygen supply and has the potential to completely circumvent the requirement for organic substrate in nitrogen removal because it is catalysed by autotrophic microorganisms &#150; Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidisers) and aerobic nitrifiers. For study of the SND process, a completely automated 2 L sequencing batch reactor was developed with on-line monitoring of the dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and oxidation-reduction (ORP) potential. The SBR was operated continuously for up to 2 years and, due to its separation of different phases by time, enabled the study and optimisation of different microbial activities, including acetate uptake and conversion to PHB (feast phase), PHB hydrolysis and consumption (famine phase), nitrification and denitrification (and SND). All experimental work was performed using a mixed culture 

Project summary and acetate as the organic substrate. Acetate consumption and PHB production was studied under different oxygen supply rates to establish conditions that allow maximum conversion of acetate to PHB during the feast phase. Lower DO supply rates (kLa 6 &#150; 16 h-1) resulted in preservation of a higher proportion of acetate as PHB than at higher DO supply rates (kLa 30 and 51 h-1). Up to 77 % of the reducing equivalents available from acetate were converted to PHB under O2-limitation, as opposed to only 54 % under O2-excess conditions, where a higher fraction of acetate was used for biomass growth. A metabolic model based on biochemical stoichiometry was developed that could reproduce the trends of the effect of oxygen on PHB production.

Experimental findings and simulated results highlighted the importance of oxygen control during the feast phase of an SBR in preserving reducing power as PHB. To develop an oxygen management strategy for the aerobic famine phase,the effect of the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on SND, using PHB as the electron donor, was investigated. There was a clear compromise between the rate and the percentage of SND achieved at different DO concentrations. A DO setpoint of 1 mg L-1 was optimal for both the percentage of SND (61 %) and rate of SND (4.4 mmol N. Cmol X-1. h-1). Electron flux analysis showed that most SND activity occurred during the first hour of the aerobic famine period, when the oxygen uptake rate (due to NH4 + and PHB oxidation) was highest. Aerated denitrification ceased as soon as NH4 + was depleted.

The presence of NH4 + provided an oxygen &#147;shield&#148;, preventing excessive penetration of oxygen into the flocs and creating larger anoxic zones for SND. PHB degradation was first order with respect to the biomass PHB concentration (dfPHB/dt = 0.19 . fPHB). The slow nature of PHB degradation made it a suitable substrate for SND, as it was degraded at a similar rate to ammonium oxidation. While DO control during the aerobic famine phase could increase nitrogen removal via SND, total N-removal in the SBR was still limited by the availability of reducing power(PHB) in the anoxic phase. The length of the aerobic phase needed to be minimised to prevent over-oxidation of PHB after NH4 + depletion. The specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was found to be an effective on-line parameter that could reproducibly detect the end-point of nitrification. A simple method was developed for continuous, on-line measurement of the SOUR, which was used for automated adjustment of the aerobic phase length. Minimisation of the aerobic phase length by feedback control of the 

Project summary
SOUR improved nitrogen removal from 69 % (without phase length control) to 86 %, during one cycle. The SOUR-aeration control technique could successfully adapt the aerobic phase length to varying wastewater types and strengths and to varying aeration conditions. The medium- and long-term effects of oxygen management on nitrogen removal was investigated by operating the SBR continuously for up to one month using DO control throughout all stages of the SBR, i.e. oxygen-limitation during the feast phase, a DO setpoint of 1 mg L-1 during the famine phase and SOUR controlled aerobic phase length. Complete oxygen management resulted in minimisation of the amount of PHB that was oxidised aerobically in each SBR cycle and caused an accumulation of cellular PHB over time. The increased availability of PHB during aeration resulted in a higher SOUR and increased N-removal by SND from 34 to 54 %. After one month of continuous SBR operation, the settling efficiency of the biomass improved from 110 mL . g-1X to less than 70 mL . g-1X and almost complete N-removal (9 %) was achieved via SND during aeration, however at a reduced rate (1.5 mmol Cmol X-1 h-1). Therefore, long-term oxygen management resulted in biomass with improved settling characteristics and a higher capacity for SND. Results of the first main research theme highlighted the importance of aeration control throughout all stages of the SBR for maximum N-removal via SND.

The CANON process was investigated as an alternative to the use of conventional activated sludge for treatment of wastewaters limited by organic carbon substrate. The initial study of the CANON process was performed at the Kluyver Laboratory in Delft, the Netherlands, using an already established Anammox enrichment culture. The effect of extended periods of NH4 +-limitation on the CANON microbial populations was studied, to examine their ability to recover from major disturbances in feed composition. The CANON process was stable for long periods of time until the N-loading rate reached below 0.1 kg N m 3 day-1, when a third population of bacteria developed in the system (aerobic nitrite oxidisers), resulting in a decrease in N-removal from 92 % to 57 %. Nitrite oxidisers developed due to increased levels of oxygen and nitrite. 

This highlighted the requirement for oxygen control during the CANON process to prevent increased DO levels and growth of undesired microbes. To initiate the CANON process from a local source, Anammox was enriched from local activated sludge (Perth, Western Australia). FISH analysis (fluorescence in situ hybridisation) of the enriched Anammox strain showed that it belonged to the Order Planctomycetales,

Project summary the same as all other identified Anammox strains, but represented a new species of Anammox. The enrichment culture was not inhibited by repeated exposure to oxygen, allowing initiation of an intermittently-aerated CANON process to achieve sustained, completely autotrophic ammonium removal (0.08 kg N m-3 day-1) for an extended period of time, without any addition of organic carbon substrate. Dissolved oxygen control played a critical role in achieving alternating aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidation.

The main conclusion drawn from the study is the important role of oxygen management in achieving improved nitrogen removal. A careful oxygen management strategy can minimise wastage of reducing power to improve PHB-driven SND by activated sludge and can prevent major disturbances to the population balance in the CANON system. Oxygen management has the potential to reduce aeration costs while significantly improving nitrogen removal from wastewaters limited by organic carbon.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SBR</field><field name="subject">N-removal</field><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">phb</field><field name="subject">anammox</field><field name="subject">canon</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.141647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Whose Interest? A Critical Approach to Southeast Asia&#146;s Urban Transport Dynamics</field><field name="creator">townsend@alcor.concordia.ca</field><field name="description">During recent decades, urban transport systems in Southeast Asia&#146;s industrialising high growth economies were transformed. The ownership and use of privatelyowned cars and motorcycles grew in all cities, simultaneous to the introduction of new forms of public transportation including rail rapid transit in the larger metropolises. While these cities all experienced dynamic change, the relative rate and direction of the changes to urban transport systems varied greatly as did levels of success.
 
Singapore emerged as a highly efficient transit metropolis whilst Bangkok and other cities gained notoriety as some of the world&#146;s great traffic disasters. Why these differences emerged, particularly given a regional and global context of increasing interaction and exchange of ideas and of capital flows, presents a compelling question largely unanswered by previous research. A review of the general state of knowledge about urban transport worldwide reveals fundamental disagreements over basic questions such as the social value of motorisation, the relative merits of specific modes and technologies, and prescriptions for change. However, there is a general consensus that interest groups or rent-seekers influence urban transport, which can not be understand in solely technical or value-free terms. A literature review focused on Southeast Asian cities finds that in contrast to theoretical perspectives on cities of the industrialised world, there is less acknowledgement of interests and values and more emphasis on instrumental knowledge which can be used to address immediate problems such as rapid growth in motorisation, traffic congestion, and pollution. Questions such as who wins and who loses from changes to urban transport systems are not systematically examined in the existing literature on Southeast Asian cities. In order to address this gap, a case study analysis of three key cities, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore is undertaken. This analysis utilises policy and planning documents, monographs and academic works, newspapers and archival materials, discussions with key informants, and participant observation, to reveal the significant actors and processes which shape urban transport. 

The study finds that the presence or absence of actors and
complexions of interests in the development of urban land, urban transport equipment, infrastructure construction and operation, and local environmental improvements are linked to specific urban transport outcomes. The findings provide a basis for future research, particularly in cities of the developing world characterised by economic growth, rapid motorisation of urban transport systems, and substantial inequalities of wealth and power.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban passenger transport</field><field name="subject">southeast asia</field><field name="subject">transport planning and policy</field><field name="subject">Bangkok</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Kuala Lumpar</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.142156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Digitisation of Politics: From the Emergence of Modulation to the Dissolution of the Body Politic</field><field name="creator">savat@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of politics in the context of digital technologies. Its central claim is that technologies of what I call the digital ensemble express a politics that is very different from that of other technological ensembles. In order to come to an understanding of politics in the digital, this thesis explores three broader themes by way of discussions of three different technologies or assemblages of the digital. While I do not aim to establish an overarching conclusion as to a politics of the digital, I do identify both elements that are common among the three themes and where they diverge from one another.

The first theme concerns the operation of power in the context of the database and examines how subjects are acted upon. I argue that databases represent both an amplification of the disciplinary mode of power and, as a product of that amplification, also express a new mode of power referred to by Deleuze as modulation. It is this concurrent operation of these two modes of power that produces the subject as 'dividual', both object and objectile at the same time, which has a number of consequences in terms of how subjects are controlled and governed.

The second theme considers how the subject is constituted as actor and how this relates to the construction of the political in the context of the digital ensemble. This is achieved by way of looking at the concept of the interface. I argue that digital technologies constitute very different practices or forms of doing, both spatially and temporally. Using a broader phenomenological approach, I argue that these technologies constitute very different forms of being than that of the individual that is so central to much of modern political thought and its construction of the political. A key expression of the political in the digital ensemble, I argue, is the interface, enabling the production of a new human-machine assemblage constituting itself as flow/s.

The third theme is an exploration of the conceptualisation of political action in the context of digital technologies. Here I make use of the technological assemblage of the network in exploring the actions of fluid beings. I argue that modern political thought has always conceptualised political action as the action of solid entities acting upon and in relation to other solid entities. In the context of digital technologies, however, I argue that such a conceptualisation of action is not very useful; if one conceptualises the actor as fluid, then so must its actions be conceptualised as fluid. It is in such a context that concepts of flow and turbulence gain great importance in coming to terms with politics in the digital. Indeed, to the extent that a digitisation of politics can be discerned, I argue it makes much sense to think of it as a politics of fluidity.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Politics and technology</field><field name="subject">new media and politics</field><field name="subject">technology and  subjectivity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.143826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living well towards others: The Development of an Everyday Ethics Through Emmanuel Levinas and Alfred Schutz</field><field name="creator">yhaigh@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation is concerned with what it means to live well towards others. It develops a form of everyday ethics that emphasises how existing in the world and being ethical are entwined. To develop this approach to ethics this study employs Alfred Schutz&#146;s phenomenological descriptions of everyday world and Emmanuel Levinas&#146;s concept of the ethical. The purpose of the thesis is to develop an understanding of ethics that operates at the everyday level of human-to-human contact. This form of ethics is significant in that it indicates that being ethical is an important aspect of human life. My intention is to show that ethics is always more than simply the institution of codes of conduct that govern the way people act. 

The significance of the thesis is that it contributes both to ways in which ethics can be understood and to the manner in which ethics can be operationalised at an institutional level.

My thesis has four specific aims. First, to examine the conditions and characteristics that constitute the everyday world as understood in Alfred Schutz&#146;s work. Second, to explore Emmanuel Levinas&#146;s understanding of the ethical. My third aim is to synthesise these theorists&#146; ideas through my heuristic device, Echoes of the Other. This device will allow me to extract the conditions for and features of an everyday ethics. My fourth aim is to point to an in situ illustration of this approach to ethics. This will be drawn from my observations at the Western Australian Police Academy.

My argument is that synthesising Levinas&#146;s and Schutz&#146;s ideas will enable the development of an everyday ethics. This will highlight the ways in which ethics functions at the micro levels of human life. This study contributes to approaches to ethics, and specifically, ethics derived from Levinas&#146;s ethical relation. This approach can be of use to people interested in ethics, phenomenology, the works of Levinas and Schutz and those concerned with developing ways to live well towards others.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Levinas E</field><field name="subject">Schultz A</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.144708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking Innovation and Local Uptake in Rural Development Potential for Renewable Energy Cooperatives In Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">firoze@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In Bangladesh, as elsewhere in the world, energy both commercial and noncommercial, serves as a major vehicle for development. In the last three decades, lopsided development efforts, without proper concern for the environment and productivity level of natural resources have created significant problems for development sustainability in Bangladesh. The energy sector faces deep crisis in meeting increasing energy demands for development of agriculture, industry, transportation and other sectors of economy.

The country is heavily dependent on import of commercial fossil fuel energy, petroleum, petroleum products and coal. Such dependency makes Bangladesh economy more vulnerable to external price shocks in the international energy market. Non-commercial energy plays a dominant role in overall energy consumption in Bangladesh. Use of non commercial energy constitutes about two-thirds of the country&#146;s total energy balance and is almost entirely supplied from the already overstressed biomass resources of the country. The population size and the vast majority living in rural areas have created immense pressure on the country&#146;s biomass resources resulting in massive deforestation, decline of soil fertility and reduced productivity of agriculture. Desperate access to resources, particularly in rural areas is also causing uneven development of the rural population in Bangladesh.

The development of the energy sector is a time bound issue and demands proper and timely attention. For Bangladesh, substitution of current biomass energy use with iv sustainable energy sources and their effective management is therefore critically important to sustain its overall development.

There is ample scope for introducing energy efficient technologies and energy conservation measures in commercial and non-commercial energy use in Bangladesh. Effective and realistic energy planning and policy formulation is therefore crucially important for sustainable development in Bangladesh.

The thesis explores the possibility of introducing an alternate approach to rural energy development through a series of case studies on selected technologies viz. biogas and improved efficiency cook stoves technology projects in the public sector and Grameen Shakti&#146;s renewable energy programme in the private sector.

Application of village energy supply system based on renewable energy technologies utilising abundantly available renewable resources of the country and already well in place technologies such as solar PV, bio digesters and energy storage batteries will be trailed within a framework that works with the participation of the (rural/village) community in running and managing energy supply in the villages. Introduction of a community based energy supply system Rural Energy Cooperative (REC) has been examined as a model for rural energy development, targeting economic, environmental and community development at the same time, which forms together the necessary foundation for sustainable development in (rural) Bangladesh, as well as in other parts of the developing world.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">renewable energy technology</field><field name="subject">rural developments</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.145111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dogs, Humans and Gastrointestinal Parasites: Unravelling Epidemiological and Zoonotic Relationships in an endemic Tea-Growing Community in Northeast India</field><field name="creator">r.traub@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">A simultaneous survey of canine and human gastrointestinal (GI) parasites was conducted in three socioeconomically disadvantaged, tea-growing communities in Assam, India. The aims of this study were to determine the epidemiology of GI parasites of zoonotic significance in dogs and geohelminth infection in humans using a combination of molecular biological and classical parasitological and epidemiological tools.

A total of 328 and 101 dogs participated in the study. The prevalence of GI parasites in dogs was 99%. Parasitic stages presumed to be host-specific for humans such as Ascaris spp., Trichuris trichiura and Isospora belli were also encountered in dog faeces. A polymerase chain reaction - linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) was developed to identify the species of Ascaris eggs in dog faeces. The results supported the dog's role as a significant disseminator and environmental contaminator of Ascaris lumbricoides, in communities where promiscuous defecation by humans exist. The prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors for infection with Ascaris, hookworms and Trichuris were also determined among the human population. The overall prevalence of Ascaris was 38% and 43% for both hookworms and Trichuris. 

The strongest predictors for the intensity of geohelminths included socioeconomic status, age, household crowding, level of education and lack of footwear when outdoors. 

The zoonotic potential of canine Giardia was investigated by genetically characterising G. duodenalis isolates recovered from humans and dogs at three different loci. Phylogenetic analysis placed canine Giardia isolates within the genetic groupings of human isolates. Further evidence for zoonotic transmission was supported by strong epidemiological data. A highly sensitive and specific PCR RFLP based test was developed to detect and differentiate the species of canine hookworms directly from eggs in faeces. Thirty-six percent of dogs were found to harbour single infections with A. caninum, 24% single infections with A. braziliense and 38% mixed infections with both species. 

This newly developed PCR-based test provided a rapid, highly sensitive and specific tool for the epidemiological screening of canine Ancylostoma species in a community. A combination of canine population management, effective anthelmintic regimes and improvements in health education and sanitation is recommended for the control of canine and human gastrointestinal parasites in these communities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dogs</field><field name="subject">humans</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasites</field><field name="subject">epidemiological and zoonotic relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040503.145757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campsite impact monitoring in the temperate eucalypt forests of Western Australia: An integrated approach</field><field name="creator">asmith@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study assessed the social and biophysical impacts of camping in the eucalypt forests of southwestern Western Australia. This was an integrated study examining both biophysical and social impacts in designated, developed and informal recreation areas used for camping. Four existing and proposed national parks and a Reserve, comprised of 110 designated and 12 informal campsites, provided the study sites. Previous research has focused on backcountry campsites and trails in wilderness areas in United States. 
	
A combined survey approach using multiple indicator ratings and measures was used to assess the biophysical impacts of camping. Adjustments to monitoring procedures used in backcountry areas were made so that the indicators were applicable to designated, developed campsites where a management footprint has been imposed. Visitors were surveyed at the designated campsites to establish how existing recreation opportunities were being used. Further, potential indicators and standards were identified to determine what kinds of social and resource conditions were acceptable to visitors and managers. A rating system was then developed combining biophysical and social indicators of importance to visitors and managers with their perceptions of acceptable change obtained from the surveys.

Based on the indices derived from the rating system and results for a suite of associated indicators, designated campsites were significantly less impacted than informal ones. For both campsite types the amount of tree damage and litter exceeded the standards set by 50% of visitors and managers. Both visitors and managers were generally more concerned about biophysical impacts than they were about social ones, although site cleanliness was of concern. Both were generally satisfied with the size and number of groups encountered, in contrast to study findings from the United States. 

This study has developed and successfully applied an integrated approach to monitoring the impacts of recreational use on forested campsites in southwestern Australia. This system effectively and efficiently uses a combination of multiple indicator ratings and measures to produce an impact index, plus social surveys to provide information on conditions, indicators and standards of importance to managers and visitors. It also provides a means for the first time, of objectively monitoring designated, developed campsites where it is inappropriate to judge impacts against an undisturbed control.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">impact monitoring</field><field name="subject">intergrated monitoring</field><field name="subject">campsites</field><field name="subject">recreation impacts</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040504.151201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant Mechanisms Contributing to Acid Impairment of Nodulation of Medicago murex and Medicago sativa by Sinorhizobium medicae</field><field name="creator">ycheng@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The widespread sowing of the perennial forage legume Medicago sativa to lower groundwater tables in south-western Australia is limited as many soils targeted for its use are too acidic (pHCaCl2 &lt; 5) for consistent nodulation with Sinorhizobium spp. The annual medic M. murex grows and nodulates well in these acidic soils, but it cannot fill the niche of M. sativa in lowering groundwater tables. The differential ability of M. murex and M. sativa to nodulate in acid soils provided the opportunity to compare the nodulation responses between the two species and to identify the mechanisms contributing to the poor nodulation of M. sativa in soil of low pH.

An initial glasshouse experiment compared the nodulation of M. murex cv. Zodiac and M. sativa cv. Aquarius with S. medicae strains WSM419 and CC169. Subsequent glasshouse and laboratory experiments used only the more acid-tolerant S. medicae strain WSM419. In the glasshouse in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3, the uppermost nodule on both M. murex and M. sativa formed at 4-5 cm below the hypocotyl, but the nodules on M. sativa formed almost 4 weeks later than those on M. murex. The difference in nodulation response between M. murex and M. sativa was related to numbers of S. medicae in the rhizosphere. After 24 d growth in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3, there were 100-fold higher numbers of S. medicae WSM419 associated with the roots of M. murex than M. sativa. This difference in rhizobial numbers was not due to differences in root growth as there were similar rates of root elongation in M. murex and M. sativa, or differences in the root products released as root exudates of M. murex and M. sativa produced at low pH had no significant effect on the growth of S. medicae.

Using a &#145;root mat&#146; approach on soil disks of pHCaCl2 4.49, M. sativa acidified its rhizosphere by approximately 0.2 0.4 pH-units within 4 d, while M. murex did not acidify its rhizosphere. Rates of H+ release were higher from M. sativa than from M. murex. Using videodensitometry with agarose of pH 4.5, ature parts of the tap-root of both pecies exuded OH&#150; ions, but this was pproximately 2-times higher in M. murex than in M. sativa. Consequently, oung parts of the M. sativa rhizosphere were more acidic than hat of . murex. The higher rate of acidification by the oots of M. sativa made its hizosphere less favourable for the survival and growth of S. medicae. oot hair development was initially similar for both M. murex and . sativa. However by 7 d after sowing in soil of pHCaCl2 .3, he density of root airs on M. murex increased to 37 root hairs mm-1 root, while the density of root airs on M. sativa decreased to 20 root hairs mm-1 root. Due to higher oot hair density, the roots of M. murex provided a greater surface area for the attachment and colonisation of S. medicae compared to the roots of M. sativa.

Indeed, confocal laser scanning microscopy at 7 d after sowing showed there were larger populations of a green fluorescent protein-marked transconjugant of S. medicae WSM419 colonised at 4-5 cm below the hypocotyl on the root of M. murex (3.28 pixel intensity units) compared to M. sativa (1.78 pixel intensity units). The smaller population of S. medicae colonised on the M. sativa root resulted in the observed delay in nodule development in M. sativa compared to M. murex.

Two plant mechanisms contributed to the greater numbers of S. medicae in the M. murex rhizosphere compared to M. sativa rhizosphere when plants were grown in an acidic soil: (1) roots of M. murex had a higher density of root hairs, and thus provided a larger root surface area for the growth and colonisation of S. medicae than M. sativa, and (2) roots of M. murex acidified the rhizosphere less, and thus provided more favourable conditions for the growth and colonisation of S. medicae than the rhizosphere of M. sativa. Models explaining the different nodulation responses between M. murex and M. sativa in soil of pHCaCl2 4.3 and 7.0 are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040504.151812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Enduring Myth of an Okinawan Struggle: The History and Trajectory of a Diverse Community of Protest</field><field name="creator">M.Tanji@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The islands of Okinawa have a long history of people&#146;s protest. Much of this has been a manifestation in one way or another of Okinawa&#146;s enforced assimilation into Japan and their differential treatment thereafter. However, it is only in the contemporary period that we find interpretations among academic and popular writers of a collective political movement opposing marginalisation of, and discrimination against, Okinawans. This is most powerfully expressed in the idea of the three &#145;waves&#146; of a post-war &#145;Okinawan struggle&#146; against the US military bases. Yet, since Okinawa&#146;s annexation to Japan in 1879, differences have constantly existed among protest groups over the reasons for and the means by which to protest, and these have only intensified after the reversion to Japanese administration in 1972.

This dissertation examines the trajectory of Okinawan protest actors, focusing on the development and nature of internal differences, the origin and survival of the idea of a united &#145;Okinawan struggle&#146;, and the implications of these factors for political reform agendas in Okinawa. It explains the internal differences in organisation, strategies and collective identities among the groups in terms of three major priorities in their protest. There are those protesters principally preoccupied with opposing the US-Japan security treaty and for whom the preservation of pacifist clauses of the Constitution and the utilisation of formal legal and political processes are paramount as a modus operandi. There are also those primarily concerned to protect Okinawa&#146;s distinctive lifestyle and natural environment, as well as an assortment of feminist groups fundamentally opposed to the presence of US bases due to concerns about patriarchy and exploitation of women, fostered by militarism. In these last two perspectives, protest tends to be conducted much more via informal, network-oriented processes, and includes engagement with international civil society groups.

The increasing range of protest groups derived from the expansion of these last two perspectives, diversifying beyond the traditional workers&#146; unions and political parties, is consistent with the &#145;new social movement&#146; theory. This theory&#146;s emphasis on the importance of socio economic change for the emergence of groups with post-materialist reform agendas and a stronger predisposition towards informal political processes resonates with the Okinawan experiences. However, the impact of this has been, especially after the reversion in 1972, to hinder effective coalition building among the Okinawan protest groups and organisations, weakening their power to bring about political reforms, particularly towards the removal of the US military bases from the island.

Crucially, though, the idea of an &#145;Okinawan struggle&#146; has endured in the community of protest throughout the post-war period. Ideas about marginalisation of, and discrimination against, Okinawans constitute a powerful myth of an &#145;Okinawan struggle&#146;, which has a long history of being redefined, used and exploited differently
by a wide range of protest actors, adjusted to their particular and historically specific struggles. Indeed, in the event that the US military bases were withdrawn from Okinawa, the ability and appeal of the myth of an &#145;Okinawan struggle&#146; would therefore not necessarily expire, even if it will increasingly be joined by other protest perspectives as a result of the flowering of new social movements.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Okinawa</field><field name="subject">social movements</field><field name="subject">protest</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040510.152840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transoceanic Radical: The Many Identities of William Duane</field><field name="creator">N.Little@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the American career of William Duane (1760-1835) in the light of his earlier, and much less studied period in Ireland, England and India. It is the study of the development of one of America&#146;s pre-eminent newspaper editors. Although Duane is not a first-tier figure of the Early Republican period such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson or Alexander Hamilton, he certainly fits comfortably within the second-tier with men such as James Thomson Callender, Tench Coxe, John Binns and William Cobbett. He is an important figure within the historiography on the Early Republican period which has come out in recent years. He has an important role in three recent and seminal works on the period by Durey, Wilson and Pasley: Transatlantic Radicals, United Irishmen, United States and &#147;The Tyranny of Printers&#148;. 

This is a study of the identity of Duane measured against his political change and shifting sense of self. It seeks to answer the question: Who was William Duane? The thesis probes the question in depth by looking at Duane&#146;s origins and then tracing his life in 1790s Philadelphia. The portrayal of Duane found in the recent historiography and in the first academic biography of Duane, Kim T. Phillips&#146; William Duane: A Radical Journalist in the Age of Jefferson, lets Duane&#146;s version of self rest too easily, without interrogating how he constructed his identity within an American political context for an American reading audience. For example, although Duane constructed himself as a citizen of the United States by birth, the thesis maintains that he was not an U.S. citizen at all but was born in Newfoundland and was by eighteenth-century definitions a British subject.

The thesis offers a great deal more detailed archival research within the above framework. First, it develops Duane&#146;s familial relationships in his early life in much more detail than before. I have uncovered more details on his life from numerous sources, particularly letters, and a careful, textual search for any information on Duane&#146;s earlier career in Ireland and England in the 1780s which has been overlooked by previous researchers. The thesis then places this material in the context of the newspaper trade in 1780s Clonmel and London while building a narrative analysis of this period before moving on to India.

Second, this thesis demonstrates Duane&#146;s links to the East India Company army. The importance of Duane&#146;s Indian career also lies in his being part of a wider chronology of deported editors and government suppression of the press within the period from 1780 to 1799. The place of Duane within an ignored history of radical migrations to India is also dealt with as is his emergence as a pro revolutionary editor in Calcutta after the declaration of war in 1793.

Third, the thesis uncovers a great deal more archival information on the period of Duane&#146;s membership of the London Corresponding Society and his editorship of the Telegraph &#150; a strongly pro-French newspaper in wartime London. This period was a short but crucial one for Duane as he witnessed first-hand the last real throes of a British revolutionary movement and the enactment of two important bills which sought to smother the L.C.S. and the other plebeian radical groups.

Fourth, the thesis examines Duane&#146;s role in what has been perceived as a crucial turning point in American history &#150; the election of Thomas Jefferson to the presidency in 1800. The thesis seeks to understand what Duane&#146;s impact on American politics was and how his earlier career shaped his political outlook and his actions in America. It seeks to denativise the Early Republican Period by pointing out outside currents that Duane used in defining what Americanness was as opposed to his conceptualisation of Federalism and Britain.

Finally, the thesis argues that the story of William Duane is one of an eighteenthcentury editor&#146;s transoceanic search for a home.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">N/A</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040510.153718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Rehabilitation Practices for the Outer Batter Slopes of Bauxite Residue Disposal Areas at Worsley Refinery, Collie, Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">Collis04@agric.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Control of water erosion of soil at mine sites requires an ability to predict the effects of different management practices on soil loss.  Using soil loss models such as the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) requires calibration of the model for materials and situations that are not defined in the model&#146;s handbook or software.  

The outer slopes of bauxite residue disposal areas are potentially highly erodible surfaces, and a recent evaluation of previous rehabilitation practices at Worsley Alumina, Collie, Western Australia, identified areas on the bauxite residue disposal areas where vegetation establishment and management of long term soil loss could be improved.  Field experiments commencing in April 2000 at Worsley Alumina&#146;s bauxite refinery, Collie, and laboratory tilting flume experiments run at the University of Queensland, were designed to quantify the effectiveness of different surface treatments on reducing short-term soil loss, and to model long-term erosion risks.  

Crushed ferricrete caprock &#150; rock-pitch &#150; and different types of mulches, seed mixes and fertiliser rates were applied to the compacted clay batter slopes used to contain bauxite residue, with runoff, soil loss and vegetation establishment monitored periodically over 27 months.  Laboratory tilting flume results were related to the field data using the soil erosion models MINErosion, the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) and RUSLE to predict event-based and annual soil loss for different treatments.  

Turbo-mulch, a blocky, coarse pine bark, was the most effective surface treatment for promoting vegetation establishment, reducing rill formation and reducing soil loss, a result supported in both the field and laboratory results.  Turbo-mulch and vegetation did not reduce runoff, but resulted in decreased soil loss.  This shows the importance of protecting soil from raindrop impact and of the soil holding capacity of vegetation.  Increased seed and fertiliser rates did not significantly affect native plant numbers or foliage cover on topsoil without turbo-mulch.  Rock-pitch was found to be resistant to erosion and mass movement along a rock-pitch/compacted clay interface.  Field erosion measurements ranged from 0.87 t/ha/yr for turbo-mulched treatments to 7.41 t/ha/yr for a treatment with a different seed mix, lacking turbo-mulch and lacking underlying rock-pitch.  RUSLE soil loss predictions based on soil properties and soil loss estimates from the MINErosion model ranged from 0.27 to 60.0 t/ha/yr.  RUSLE predictions based on tilting flume data ranged from 0.14 to 81.1 t/ha/yr.  RUSLE overpredicted soil loss for treatments without turbo-mulch, and underestimated soil loss for turbo-mulched treatments, necessitating calibration based on the unique materials trialed in this study.  

The relative soil loss measured in the field was best represented by RUSLE predictions based on tilting flume data rather than the MINErosion model.  MINErosion did not adequately describe the effect of bulk density and infiltration on soil loss of compacted/consolidated materials.  MUSLE and RUSLE are adequate models for the Western Australian conditions of this study, but further research is required to calibrate the C factor for turbo-mulched surfaces and calibrate the P factor for rock-pitch.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil erosion</field><field name="subject">tilting flume</field><field name="subject">turbo-mulch</field><field name="subject">rock-pitch</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040510.154254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology of elasmobranchs in a subtropical embayment in Western Australia and of chondrichthyan fisheries in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">wwhite@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that the spatial and food resources in the nearshore waters of a subtropical embayment in Western Australia (Shark Bay) will be partitioned within and amongst the main elasmobranch species that occur in that large water body. The size and age compositions, growth rates and reproductive biology of females and males of the nervous shark Carcharhinus cautus in Shark Bay were then determined to better understand the mode of life of this abundant species in this embayment. The second aim was to determine the species and size compositions of chondrichthyans landed by fisheries employing different methods in south-eastern Indonesia. The implications of these data for management were next determined and aspects of the reproductive biology of the most abundant of those species were explored, in a very preliminary manner. 

The nearshore, shallow waters of Shark Bay are used as a nursery area by several shark species and the different habitats in those waters are partitioned, to a certain degree, amongst those species. Ten species of shark (5 families), five species of ray (4 families) and twelve species of teleost (10 families) were caught in those waters. Carcharhinus cautus was the most abundant species, contributing 59.9% to the total number of elasmobranchs and 42.3% to all fish caught. This species and Negaprion acutidens were collected mainly or entirely from unvegetated sites, whereas Rhizoprionodon acutus, Carcharhinus brevipinna and Chiloscyllium punctatum were caught largely or exclusively at the seagrass site. The number of elasmobranch species and number of individuals of elasmobranchs were greatest in the seagrass site and least in the unvegetated site where no vegetation was present nearby, and they were significantly less in the latter site than in the one where dense mangroves were present nearby. These two biotic variables were also significantly greater in summer and autumn than in winter when temperatures were lowest. The species composition of elasmobranchs in each habitat type almost invariably differed significantly from that in each of the other habitat types and there was evidence that the species composition of elasmobranchs varied in a similar seasonal manner at the three unvegetated sites. Carcharhinus cautus, and probably also Hemigaleus microstoma and Chiloscyllium punctatum, were the only species that completed their life cycles in the nearshore, shallow waters of Herald Bight. However, the capture of the juveniles of a further four species with umbilical scars emphasises the importance of these waters as a nursery habitat for shark species.

The dietary compositions of one ray species (Rhinobatus typus) and three shark species (Carcharhinus cautus, Negaprion acutidens, Rhizoprionodon acutus) undergo size-related changes and differ among these species, thereby reducing the potential for competition for food within and among these four species. Rhinobatus typus fed almost exclusively on penaeid prawns and portunid crabs, which is reflected in its narrow dietary breadth, whereas different species of teleosts constituted a major component of the diets of each size class of the three shark species. The relative contributions of the different species of teleost to the diets of the three shark species varied. The variations in dietary composition among the four species reflect differences in behaviour, modes of feeding and relative mouth sizes.

Carcharhinus cautus copulates in late October&#150;early November, shortly followed by ovulation (and thus conception) and parturition occurs about 11 months later. The reproductive cycle of C. cautus is biennial. Female and male C. cautus reached ca 28 and 32% of their lengths at their maximum observed ages, respectively, at the time of parturition. Females and males of C. cautus attained maximum total lengths of 1330 and 1110 mm, respectively, and maximum ages after parturition of 16 and 12 years, respectively. Maturity was attained at about 1010 mm by females and 910 mm by males and at least 50% of females and males had become mature by the end of their sixth and fourth years of life, respectively. The three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth curves provided reasonably good fits to the lengths at age of females and males of C. cautus during just postnatal life and throughout the whole of pre- and postnatal life. However, the four-parameter Schnute growth curve significantly improved the fit to these data for both females and males from conception and for females from birth. The question of when, from a biological view point, it might be appropriate to switch from using a von Bertalanffy growth curve to the more complex Schnute growth curve are discussed.

A total of 139 chondrichthyan species, comprising 77 species of shark representing 17 families, 61 species of ray representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan, were recorded at the ten landing sites surveyed in south-eastern Indonesia. However, it should be recognised that up to 49 of the 139 chondrichthyan species recorded have apparently not yet been described and thus assigned a species name. The most speciose and commonly recorded families were the Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae, which collectively contributed 84.8%, respectively, to the total number of individuals of all species. The use of MDS ordination demonstrated that the species compositions at the eight main landing sites reflected to a greater extent the fishing methods used rather than the geographical location of those sites. Data on the reproductive biology of males demonstrated that a number of elasmobranch species were fished prior to the time that they attained maturity. 

The three most abundant chondrichthyan species that were caught both as juveniles and adults were Dasyatis kuhlii, Dasyatis zugei and Himantura walga. Since the reproductive cycle of each of these species did not follow a seasonal pattern, the timing of conception and parturition and the duration of gestation of these species could not be determined. The fecundity of these three species was very low, i.e. maximum of two but usually only a single embryo. The size at maturity of the three species, using data on the prevalence of mature fish, ranged from minima of 163 mm for females and males of H. walga to maxima of 237 mm for females and 239 mm for males of D. kuhlii. The translucent zones on the vertebral centra of D. kuhlii were apparently deposited annually and were thus used to estimate the ages of the individuals of this species. The maximum estimated ages of female and male D. kuhlii were 15 and 10 years, respectively.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chondrichthyans</field><field name="subject">biology</field><field name="subject">Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040510.154948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With an Olive Branch and a Shillelagh: the Political Career of Senator Paddy Lynch(1867-1944)</field><field name="creator">d.cusack@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As a loyal Empire man and ardent conscriptionist, Irish born Senator Paddy Lynch swam against the prevailing Irish Catholic Labor political current. He was one of those MP&#146;s who followed Prime Minister W.M. Hughes out of the Federal Labor caucus in November 1916, serving out the rest of his political career in the Nationalist ranks. On the face of things, he represents something of a contradiction.

A close examination of Lynch&#146;s youth in Ireland, his early years in Australia and his subsequent parliamentary career helps us to resolve this apparent paradox. It also enables us to build up a picture of Lynch the man and to explain his political odyssey. He emerges as representative of that early generation of conservative Laborites (notably J.C. Watson, W.G. Spence and George Pearce) who, once they had achieved their immediate goals of reform, saw their subsequent role as defending the prevailing social order. 

Like many of these men, Lynch&#146;s commitment to the labour movement&#146;s principles of solidarity and collective endeavour co-existed with a desire for material self advancement. More fundamentally, when Lynch accumulated property and was eventually able to take up the occupation which he had known in Ireland,farming, his evolving class interest inevitably occasioned a change in political outlook. Lynch is shown to have been an essentially conservative Meath farmer whose early involvement in the labour movement in Australia can be largely explained as a temporary phase consequent on emigration.

A single-minded and robust politician, Lynch was able to reconcile first his Irish and then his Australian nationalist loyalties with the cause of the Empire as the best guarantee of Australia&#146;s future security and advancement. He both represented and reinforced the more conservative Irish Catholic political climate which prevailed in Western Australia, compared to the more populous eastern states. The relationship of the Catholic Irish to the early labour movement in Australia was more complex and problematical than orthodox thinking has allowed. As someone who straddled both political camps, Lynch encapsulated many of the inherent ambiguities of the immigrant Irish. A study of his career allows us to gain a deeper insight into the complexities of the Irish-Australian experience.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040513.120825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the concentration of glycogen in lamb meat</field><field name="creator">R.Jacob@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The lamb industry is actively seeking to improve the quality of lamb meat produced in Australia.  Ultimate pH (pHu) is a key determinant of red meat eating quality although this measurement has not been adopted formally by the Australian lamb meat industry.  Muscle glycogen concentration is a major determinant of pHu in red meat. This thesis investigates glycogen concentration in lamb muscle and the ultimate pH (pHu) of lamb meat under commercial industry conditions as well as exploring by experimentation, some of the factors that control muscle glycogen concentration in lamb muscle.  The results of this work has contributed to an understanding of the significance of high pHu meat to the lamb industry and will assist with developing new management strategies for lambs that avoid low muscle glycogen concentration at the point of slaughter, thus high pHu in meat derived from lambs. 

The first part of the study (Experiments 1 and 2) undertook to determine the ranges of muscle glycogen concentration and lamb meat pHu found under commercial conditions and to measure any changes in these parameters associated with consignment of lambs from farm to abattoir and lairage at abattoirs.  This study utilised a new biopsy technique that allowed muscle collection from lambs on farm.  Some 16 different consignments of lambs and 3 consignments of lactating ewes were intensively monitored on farm and at abattoirs over a range of lairage times.  Sensory evaluation tests were done using meat from 6 of these consignments.  

The results showed there to be considerable variation between lamb consignments with some consignments having a very high and other consignments having a very low incidence of meat with a high pHu.  On balance &#147;on farm&#148; factors were concluded to have a greater impact on muscle glycogen concentration at slaughter than &#147;post farm gate&#148; factors.  However, there was evidence that muscle glycogen concentrations decreased during the farm curfew and transport period for some consignments so both &#147;on farm&#148; and &#147;post farm gate factors&#148; can be important.  Characteristically glycogen loss occurred during the farm curfew and transport period in consignments of Merino lambs that had high muscle glycogen concentrations prior to consignment.  Holding lambs in lairage caused no negative effects on muscle glycogen concentration although there was some evidence that very short lairage periods may increase meat pHu without causing a change in muscle glycogen concentration.  It was concluded from these experiments that the mean muscle glycogen concentration of a group of lambs needs to be greater than 1.5 g/100g on farm in order for the pHu of lamb meat to be less than 5.7.  

Subsequent to this industry study, an experiment (Experiment 3) was done to gain an understanding of muscle glycogen concentration as being an integral part of whole body glucose metabolism.  This experiment investigated the effects of exercise on a range of different muscles and tissues of lambs including liver, kidney, skin and gastrointestinal tract.  Interactions between glycogen concentrations in the liver and muscle with time after exercise showed that glycogen repletion occurred in the liver before muscle tissue.  This effect was a unique finding and could explain in part the slow rate of glycogen repletion in muscle tissue that is characteristic for ruminants.  Another major finding was an accumulation of glycogen concentration in skin during the recovery period after exercise.  It was postulated that this effect may be due to the supply of glucose to glycolytic tissues being continued even when demand for glucose in the skin was low and the capacity to store glycogen in muscle was very high. 

Experiment 3 confirmed the existence of a relationship between metabolisable energy (ME) intake and glycogen repletion in muscle tissues and found a slightly different relationship between ME intake and glycogen repletion in the liver tissue of lambs.  Muscle glycogen concentration did not change in fasted lambs and the rate of glycogen repletion in muscle after exercise was dependent on ME intake.  Differences were observed between different muscles, particularly between M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) and all other muscles, in relation to the change in glycogen concentration with time after exercise.  Glycogen concentrations changed less rapidly in the LTL than other muscles.  Glycogen concentration in the liver was associated negatively with time after exercise in fasted lambs and positively with time after exercise in fed lambs.  

Several experiments (Experiments 4, 5 and 6) were conducted to determine the affects of different nutritional factors on muscle glycogen concentration in lambs, both on farm and after commercial slaughter.  These studies showed that short term increases in ME intake will increase muscle glycogen concentration to a maximum level over a period of about 7 days (Experiment 4).  Diet composition did not affect the change in muscle glycogen concentration associated with an increase in ME intake although results from this experiment (Experiment 5) were not entirely conclusive.  There was evidence that the type of feeding and finishing system may influence the susceptibility of muscle glycogen concentration to change during consignment of lambs to slaughter.  Results from these experiments demonstrated that a goal for muscle glycogen concentration in lambs on farm of 1.5g/100g is quite achievable with contemporaneous management systems.

Finally this study highlighted the need for further research in a number of key areas in order that muscle glycogen concentration in lambs to be fully understood.  In particular, the role of muscle glycogen turnover in relation to muscle glycogen concentration was noted as an area for which further research is warranted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glycogen</field><field name="subject">meat</field><field name="subject">lamb</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040513.153312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Flow in Seagrass Ecosystems</field><field name="creator">keulen@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Water motion has been shown to influence almost every aspect of the ecology of seagrass communities; seagrass communities have likewise been shown to significantly influence water movement around them. This thesis examines the important role of water motion on seagrass ecosystems by integrating field and laboratory studies of several aspects of seagrass ecology influenced by water motion.

To facilitate the study of hydrodynamics of seagrass ecosystems, a solid state electronic current meter was designed and developed, using thermistors as flow sensing devices. Important characteristics of the meters include: no moving parts, compact size, high sensitivity (resolution
better than &#177; 0.5 cm s-1), and high sampling rate (greater than 0.2 Hz). Deployment of the meters in field measurements provided reliable and meaningful results of flow conditions through seagrass canopies, and they show great potential for use in many studies of marine ecology.

Field studies of water velocity profiles revealed significant differences between the shapes of profiles of different seagrass species, particularly between species of Posidonia and Amphibolis. Of particular note is the observation of a region of high water velocity beneath the leafy canopy of Amphibolis, which was not present in the Posidonia plants. 

Water velocity profile measurements, sediment grain size analyses and standing stock measurements were conducted across an exposure gradient in a Posidonia sinuosa meadow.
These studies revealed that, while the exposed location experienced a higher ambient water velocity than the sheltered site, the baffling influence of the seagrass canopy reduced the water velocity to approximately the same at both sites, within the meadow, although the effects varied seasonally. It was also observed that the seagrass meadow produced apparent skimming flow under the low flow conditions measured at the sheltered location; this phenomenon reflects the capacity for flow redirection over the canopy, and has important implications for the sub-canopy ecosystem and the protective role of seagrasses on the seabed.

Field and laboratory studies on the role of seagrass density on the hydrodynamic nature of seagrass ecosystems revealed that water velocity profiles through meadows of reduced densities, and different shoot arrangements, were markedly different to &#147;natural&#148; profiles, implying the
existence of a &#147;critical density&#148; (approximately 25 % of natural meadow density) with regard to canopy hydraulics.

The role of water motion at an individual leaf scale was investigated with a series of laboratory flume studies of photosynthetic rates of seagrass and algae. The results show that the response of photosynthetic rate to water velocity depends very much on the plant species, with the algae markedly more productive (on a unit chlorophyll basis) than the seagrasses tested. Increases in
photosynthetic rate were observed at water velocities above approximately 2.5 cm s-1; negligible photosynthetic activity was observed below this velocity. Calculation of P v. I curves indicated that the Posidonia species had high Ik values at low velocities (1360 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. australis and 250.8 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. sinuosa at 1.58 cm s-1), which decreased with increasing water velocity (to 138.9 and 24.77 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for P. australis and P. sinuosa respectively), while the algal species had relatively constant values of Ik across all water velocities (85.42 to 312.7 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for Ulva lactuca and 169.7 to 573.9 :mol quanta m-2 s-1 for
Laurencia cruciata). Dye visualization studies showed that the algae remained quite rigid at all the velocities tested, while the seagrass leaves compressed as velocity increased. This resulted in an increased rate of turbulence creation by the algae, which is believed to enhance photosynthetic rates, through improved nutrient exchange rates across the boundary layer adjacent to the thallus.

Further dye visualization studies revealed the significance of blade morphology on the creation of microscale turbulence at the surface of seagrass leaves. Epiphytic growth on seagrass leaves was observed to play an important role in breaking up water flow across the leaf surface, thereby enhancing the creation of microscale turbulence.

From these studies, it is clear that water motion influences all aspects of the functioning of all
components of seagrass communities, playing a role in nutrient supply, reproduction, physical stability, temperature and metabolic functions. The influence of seagrass meadows on coastal hydrodynamics is also apparent, with potential impacts on sediment stability, recruitment of benthic species and coastal erosion. This thesis has clearly demonstrated that water motion is
an important parameter in seagrass ecology, and requires serious consideration in seagrass research, conservation and rehabilitation programmes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">marine ecology</field><field name="subject">plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040518.91242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use changes and the properties of stormwater entering a wetland on a sandy coastal plain in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">H.Kobryn@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study investigated the catchment of an urban wetland on sandy soils in Perth, Western Australia. The wetland is of high conservation value but is currently used as a stormwater-compensating basin. The three main aims of this work were to:
1. determine the importance of stormwater drains in the water and pollutant balance of the lake;
2. evaluate pollutant retention rates by the wetland; and
3. identify current land uses in the catchment, determine their impacts on the wetland and identify tolerable levels of urbanisation for a wetland of this type.

Stormwater flowing in and out of the lake subcatchments was monitored for two years for background flows and storm events. Water discharge, physical and chemical characteristics &#151;including nutrients and heavy metals &#151; were measured. Water and pollutant mass balances were determined. There was year-round flow at all sites, except from the smallest subcatchment. Flow characteristics differed between sites and were more influenced by catchment characteristics than rain intensity or duration.  More water entered than left the lake in spring. In autumn more water left the lake via the overflow than entered. 

Due to poor maintenance, many drains overflowed during storm events. When compared to Australian and New Zealand  Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) water quality guidelines for receiving waters, only pH and conductivity met the recommended criteria. The nutrient and heavy metal loads varied with rainfall during both years of study. Suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were proportional to rainfall, while concentrations of dissolved forms of nutrients were not. Background flows contributed significantly to the pollutant load. More than 85% of total suspended solids, nutrients and heavy metals were retained by the wetland &#151; the only exceptions being copper and some forms of dissolved nutrients. An evaluation of the performance of the lake as a pollutant sink, using published data from constructed wetlands, identified phosphorus as the pollutant that requires the largest area for treatment.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stormwater runoff and pollution</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">land use in the catchment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040519.165016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated Mass, Solute, Isotopic and Thermal Balances of a Coastal Wetland</field><field name="creator">taiga@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">Mass, solute (chloride), isotope (deuterium) and thermal balances were completed at Perry Lakes, two semi-permanent 'water table' lakes near Perth, Western Australia.  All balance components except groundwater discharge/recharge were measured independently.  These difficult to measure groundwater components of lake-aquifer interaction were estimated by integrating mass, solute and chloride data in sequential 4 day balances spanning two years.  Before urbanisation, such wetlands functioned predominantly as flow-through lakes.  Now, large winter storm water inputs (and summer artificial level maintenance pumped locally from groundwater) dominate.  In East Lake these inputs together comprise 42% of the annual water budget; groundwater discharge is reduced to just 2%.  Even under flow-through conditions, these 'non natural' inputs are so large East Lake always tends towards a recharge state and commonly becomes a local groundwater mound.  Flow-through is established in both lakes over winter.  Initially each lake functions separately however as winter progresses shared capture and release zones are established.  Maintenance of lake levels in early summer forces East Lake back to recharge status.

Sediment heat flux (Qse) is significant in these very shallow lakes.  Over summer Qse was negative, with a net movement of heat from the water into the sediments which act as a seasonal heat sink.  In winter Qse was positive and stored summer heat was returned to the water column.  This flux at times exceeded 40 W m-2.  Evaporation was determined independently by floating pan, leaving Qse as the thermal balance residual.  Ignoring Qse, annual evaporation determined by thermal balance was over estimated by 7%.  Over and under estimates of individual 12 day balance period evaporation exceeded 50%.  

Monthly Class A (Perth airport) pan coefficients varied from 0.54 (January) to 0.86 (September).  Ten empirical equations for evaporation were calibrated and compared with the East Lake floating pan.  Best performer was the Makkink which tracked the floating pan closely throughout all seasons.  Poorest were the Penman, DeBruin-Keijman, Priestly-Taylor and Brutsaert-Stricker which grossly over estimated late winter evaporation.  Transpiration from Typha orientalis, estimated using hydrograph techniques was 43% of open water evaporation in summer and 28% annually.  Temperature controlled evaporation pans (tracking lake temperature) experimentally determined the local deuterium content of lake evaporate &#131;&#212;E, required for isotopic balances.  Techniques employing pans evaporated to dryness and pans evaporated at constant volume were run in tandem continuously for two years.

This study singularly integrates mass, solute and isotope balances thereby allowing groundwater components to be accurately quantified.  The isotope balances are unique, being the only such balances incorporating experimentally derived local deuterium values of lake evaporate.  This study represents the only thermal balance, the only accurate determination of pan-lake coefficients and the first calibration of commonly used empirical evaporation equations for Swan Coastal Plain wetlands.  

Groundwater levels in the western suburbs of Perth have declined over 40 years and a disproportionate larger decline now seriously threatens Perry Lakes.  Modelling suggests regional groundwater extraction exceeds recharge.  Wetland managers can no longer maintain East Lake via local groundwater extraction.  Artificial recharge using imported surface and waste water are possible future management options.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swan Coastal Plain</field><field name="subject">mass balance</field><field name="subject">solute balance</field><field name="subject">chloride balance</field><field name="subject">isotope balance</field><field name="subject">deuterium balance</field><field name="subject">isotopic exchange par</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040520.130717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human impacts on Australian sea lions, Neophoca cinerea, hauled out on Carnac Island (Perth, Western Australia): implications for wildlife and tourism management</field><field name="creator">jporsini@bigpond.net.au</field><field name="description">Over the last 15 years, pinniped tourism has experienced a rapid growth in the Southern Hemisphere, and particularly in Australia and New Zealand where at least four sites attract more than 100,000 visitors per year. Tourism focused on the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), a protected species endemic to Australia, occurs in at least nine sites in South Australia and Western Australia. Australian sea lions haul out on several offshore islands in the Perth region.

Carnac Island Nature Reserve is one of the main sites where people can view sea lions near Perth, either during recreational activities or on commercial tours.
This study sought: (1) to investigate the potential impact of human visitors on Australian sea lions hauled out on Carnac Island, (2) to consider implications of the results for the management of Carnac Island Nature Reserve, and (3) to examine under which conditions tourism and recreation around sea lions can be sustained in the long term.

Sea lion numbers, rate of return to the site, behavioural response to human presence and incidents of disturbances of sea lions by visitors were recorded over a period of four months on Carnac Island. A survey of 207 visitors was also carried out.

Findings indicated that there were two main types of human impacts on the sea lions:
&#149; A specific state of sea lion vigilance induced by low level, but ongoing, repetitive disturbances from human presence, sustained at various approach distances ranging to more than 15 m, vigilance that is different from the behaviour profile observed in the absence of human disturbance,
&#149; Impacts resulting from incidental direct disturbances of sea lions by visitors from inappropriate human recreational activities or from visitors trying to elicit a more &#145;active&#146; sea lion response than the usual &#145;sleeping or resting&#146; behaviour on display; these impacts included sea lions retreating and leaving the beach, or displaying aggressive behaviour.

Impacts on sea lions from these disturbances may range from a potential sea lion physiological stress response to sea lions leaving the beach, a reduction in the time sea lions spend hauling out, and, in the longer term, the risk of sea lions abandoning the site altogether. Repeated instances of visitors (including unsupervised young children) approaching sea lions at very short distances of less than 2.5 m represented a public safety risk.

Results also indicated that (1) the numbers of sea lions hauled out and their rate of return to the beach did not appear to be affected by an increase in the level of human visitation (although longer-term studies would be required to confirm this result); and (2) there appeared to be a high turnover rate of sea lions at the site from day to day, suggesting that there are frequent arrivals and departures of sea lions to and from Carnac Island.

The visitor survey indicated that many visitors to Carnac Island had a recreational focus that was not primarily directed towards sea lion viewing (&#145;incidental ecotourists&#146;). Although many visitors witnessed incidental disturbance caused by humans to sea lions, they did not seem to recognise that they themselves could disturb sea lions through their mere presence. Visitors also seemed to have a limited awareness of the safety risk posed by sea lions at close range. Visitors expressed support for the presence of a volunteer ranger on the beach and for more on-site information about sea lions. Finally, visitors indicated that they greatly valued their sea lion viewing experience. It is anticipated that the continued increase in visitation to Carnac Island from recreation and from tourism will result in intensified competition for space between humans and sea lions. Long-term impacts of human disturbances on sea lions are unknown, but a physiological stress response and/or the abandonment of haulout sites has been observed in other pinniped species.

The findings of this study highlight the need to implement a long-term strategy to reduce disturbance levels of sea lions by visitors at Carnac Island to ensure that tourism and recreation around sea lions can be sustained in the long term. Recommendations include measures to control visitor numbers on the island through an equitable allocation system between various user groups, the development of on-site sea lion interpretation and a public education and awareness program, the setting up of a Sea Lion Sanctuary Zone on the main beach, ongoing monitoring of sea lion and visitor numbers and other data, and a system of training and accreditation of guides employed by tour operators.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian sea lion</field><field name="subject">Neophoca cinerea</field><field name="subject">Wildlife management</field><field name="subject">Wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">Carnac Island Nature Reserve</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040520.154341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing the Total Tract Apparent Digestibility of Nutrients from Wheat for the Weanling Pig</field><field name="creator">j.kim@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The objectives of the studies conducted in the Part A of this thesis were to quantify the variation of digestible energy (DE) content of wheat and to document the responsible factors for the variation. The general hypothesis tested in Part A of this thesis was that the variety, growing region, growing season, supplementation of xylanase and postharvest grain storage (i.e., six months of storage at ambient temperature) will influence the DE content of wheat when fed to weaner pigs. 

Experiment 1 (Chapter 3) examined the variation in the chemical composition of wheats as influenced by variety (Arrino, Westonia and Stiletto were selected), growing region (each wheat was selected from a high, medium and low rainfall region), season (1999 and 2000) and post harvest storage for 6 months. In this experiment, up to a 19% variation in the crude protein (CP) content (mean13.3, SD 2.59), up to a 5% variation in the starch content (mean 65.4, SD 3.56), and a 10-20% variation in the total (mean 9,2, SD 0.86), insoluble (mean 8.1, SD 0.84) and soluble (mean 1.1, SD 0.23) non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) contents were observed. The major experimental findings were:
&#149; Variety of wheat influenced the variation of most carbohydrate components, including fast digestible starch (FDS) (P&lt;0.001), acid detergent fibre (ADF) (P&lt;0.01), total and insoluble NSP (P&lt;0.05), and in vitro extract viscosity (P&lt;0.05);
&#149; The annual precipitation level in each region correlated to bushel weight (P&lt;0.01), protein (P&lt;0.01) and carbohydrate composition, including starch (P&lt;0.05), soluble NSP (P&lt;0.001), lignin (P&lt;0.001) and free sugars (P&lt;0.001), indicating the importance of the growing environment on the DE content of wheat;
&#149; Growing season influenced bushel weight (P&lt;0.001), CP (P&lt;0.01), amylose and amylopectin (components of starch, P&lt;0.05), ADF (P&lt;0.001), lignin (P&lt;0.001), soluble NSP (P&lt;0.001) and free sugars contents (P&lt;0.001), and the in vitro extract viscosity of wheat (P&lt;0.05);
&#149; Storage of wheat decreased ADF (P&lt;0.05), lignin (P&lt;0.01) and soluble NSP contents (P&lt;0.01) and increased the free sugar content (P&lt;0.001).

In Experiment 2 (Chapter 4), the effect of variety, growing region and growing season on the DE content of wheat in 5-week-old male weaner pigs was examined, and Summary III correlations between various chemical composition of wheat and DE content were established. The major findings were:
&#149; The DE content of wheats varied by up to 1.3 MJ/kg (12.5 13.8; mean = 13.3) in 1999 and by up to 1.8 MJ/kg (12.6 14.4; mean = 13.7) in 2000;
&#149; Both the variety and growing region significantly influenced (P&lt;0.05 - P&lt;0.001) the DE content of wheat;
&#149; Generally, the wheat variety Westonia and wheats grown in the low rainfall region contained a higher DE content than other wheats and growing regions;
&#149; In addition, growing season influenced (P&lt;0.001) DE content of wheat;
&#149; The mean DE content determined with weaner pigs in the current study was approximately 1 MJ/kg DM lower when compared to published estimates of the DE content of wheat determined with growing pigs;
&#149; Prediction of in vivo DE content of wheat for weaner pigs using NIRS (Near Infra- Red Spectroscopy) was not successful.
&#149; Significant inverse relationships between the DE content and xylose (P&lt;0.05), NDF (P&lt;0.01), total-P (P&lt;0.01) and phytate-P content (P&lt;0.05) of wheat were seen in 1999. However, such relationships were not significant in 2000, indicating a very strong seasonal influence on both chemical composition and DE content of wheat.

Experiment 3 (Chapter 5) examined the effects of a supplemental enzyme (xylanase) and storage for 6 months on the DE content of wheats. In 1999, use of the enzyme tended to increase the DE content from 13.3 to 13.6 MJ/kg (P=0.065) whereas in 2000, use of the enzyme caused n change in DE content (13.7 to 13.6 MJ/kg). However, the response to enzyme addition was much greater in some wheats grown in some regions than others, suggesting that the DE response to xylanase supplementation was not systematic but appeared to be associated with the grain structure, with the DE content consequently arising from an interaction between variety and growing conditions of the wheat. For wheats harvested in 1999, storage improved the E content from 13.3 to 4.0 MJ/kg (P&lt;0.01), but for the 2000 wheats, storage for 6 months decreased DE ontent from 13.7 to 13.0 MJ/kg (P&lt;0.001). However, the 2000 data need t be nterpreted with caution because some of the wheats ere infested with weevils. he DE response to supplemental ylanase in 1999 was negatively correlated to the otal and insoluble arabinose to xylose ratio (P&lt;0.01), in vitro xtract viscosity (P&lt;0.01)

Summary IV nd lignin (P&lt;0.06), while FDS (P&lt;0.06) and phytate-P (P&lt;0.06) positively correlated to he DE response to xylanase. he DE response to storage in 1999 was positively correlated to the NDF (P&lt;0.001) and ylose contents (P&lt;0.01) of the wheats, which had negative nfluences on the DE ontent of non-stored wheats. The ddition of xylanase in stored wheat did not improve he DE content, suggesting changes in chemical composition (eg, ctivation of ndogenous xylanases) during storage.

In Experiment 4 (Chapter 6), the same wheats were analysed or phosphorus (P) and hytate-P content, as the latter is onsidered to be anti-nutritive in pig diets. The total P nd phytate-P content of all wheat samples ranged 2.6 (s.e. .64) g/kg and 1.8 (s.e. 0.13) /kg DM, respectively. Endogenous phytase activity was highly variable and veraged 63 (s.e. 29.6) FTU/kg between wheats. The variety, rowing region, season and torage of wheat did not nfluence the variation of P content. However, the precipitation evel over two growing seasons was positively correlated to otal-P (P&lt;0.05) and hytate-P contents (P&lt;0.05) of wheat. Phytate-P content of wheat can be predicted from otal-P content (r=0.974, P&lt;0.001).

In Part B, two experimental designs were generated based n the results of experiments escribed in Part A. From the revious experiment (Experiment 2, Chapter 4), it was vident that the structure of starch (i.e., amylose: mylopectin ratio) and phytate-P content of wheat were correlated to DE content of wheat. To reinforce the established correlations the following experiments were carried out, with the general hypothesis that the structure of starch (i.e., waxy vs. non-waxy wheat), particle size of ground wheat, and phytate-P content of wheat will influence the digestibility of nutrients (i.e., nitrogen, energy, minerals) in wheat-based weaner pig diets.

In Experiment 5, the same variety (Janz) of a waxy (98% of total starch was amylopectin) isoline and a non-waxy  isoline (71% of total starch was amylopectin) wheat were ground through a hammermill fitted either with a 8.5 mm or 4.5 mm screen to achieve average particle sizes of 930 and 560 &#181;m, respectively. Diets were formulated and then fed to weaner pigs (3-5 weeks of age) with or without xylanase plus &#226;-glucancase. Digestibilities of starch, nitrogen, energy, and DE content of diets were measured at day 7 and day 21 to examine any age-related improvement of nutrient  Summary V digestibilities during the first 3 weeks post-weaning. Waxy wheat improved total tract  digestibility of starch (P&lt;0.05) and CP (P&lt;0.05), and the reduction of particle size improved total tract starch digestibility (P&lt;0.001) at both 7 and 21 days after weaning.

However, energy digestibility and DE content of the diet were not influenced by either wheat type or particle size. Supplementation of xylanase plus &#226;-glucanase improved starch digestibility (P&lt;0.01) and DE content (P&lt;0.05) but not other nutrients, and this occurred especially in non-waxy (P=0.03) and larger particle-sized wheat (P=0.01).

Pigs increased ability to digest protein with age (P&lt;0.05). However, the improvement in nutrient digestibilities in waxy and fine particle size wheat diets did not translate to improved pig performance.

In Experiment 6, the hypothesis tested was that the digestibility and pig performance responses to supplemental xylanase, phytase and xylanase plus phytase would differ in weaner pigs according to P content of wheat. To test this hypothesis, two wheats containing high and low levels of total P (2.52g vs. 3.76 g total-P/kg DM) were obtained and fed to weaner pigs. Diets either had no enzyme or were supplemented with xylanase, phytase, or a combination of xylanase plus phytase. The hypothesis was partly supported in this experiment, since P and Ca digestibility were influenced by a wheat content by enzyme ineraction. Overall improvements in macronutrient digestibility and pig performance by supplementation of various enzymes were not significant. Daily growth (P&lt;0.05 &#150; P&lt;0.01) and FCR (P&lt;0.05 &#150; P&lt;0.01) were improved by the supplemental enzyme only in the first week of the feeding trial, mainly due to the increased P and Ca availability induced by the enzymes. Amounts of P and Ca digested were below the recommended requirements by NRC in the first two weeks of the feeding trial. Supplementation of phytase generally improved P and Ca digestibility (P&lt;0.05) in both low-P and high-P wheats. However, xylanase plus phytase supplementation did not produce synergistic effect for macronutrients, and mineral digestibilities, over single supplementation of xylanase or phytase.

From the results obtained in this thesis I propose that: 1) The DE content of wehat for weaner pigs is variable due mainly to the change of chemical composition mediated by variety, growing environment and storage after harvest, and efficacy of supplemental xylanase is dependent on the chemical structure of NSP present in cell walls of wheat;

Both organisms have been detected in human intestinal spirochaetosis (HIS), a syndrome where the spirochaetes attach end-on to the colorectal epithelium, forming a characteristic &#161;&#176;false brush border&#161;&#177;. Colonisation by B. pilosicoli occurs at &gt;30% in Australian Aborigines (Lee &amp; Hampson, 1992), homosexual males (Trivett-Moore et al., 1998), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and individuals from developing countries (Barrett, 1990; Trott et al., 1997a). Studies on B. aalborgi have focussed mainly on its detection from Caucasians.

Clinically, colonisation with Brachyspira spp. has been linked to gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic diarrhoea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. More seriously, invasive colitis and hepatitis associated with intestinal spirochaetes have been recorded, and B. pilosicoli has been isolated from the blood of nine patients. However, the pathogenic significance of Brachyspira spp. remains uncertain, due to an inconsistent clinical picture, carriage by healthy individuals and the absence of accurate spirochaete identification in many studies.

Identification of the organisms by culture and microscopy has been difficult, due to morphological similarities and biochemical heterogeneity of the Brachyspira spp.. In addition, B. pilosicoli is the easier spirochaete to culture, and so has predominated in studies assessing faecal carriage. The recent development of molecular methods has allowed unequivocal speciation of the Brachyspira spp. Thus the main aim of this thesis was to examine the prevalence and epidemiology of B. pilosicoli and B. aalborgi in Australia, using this new methodology.

Intestinal carriage of both species was examined in faecal specimens using culture, microscopy and two species-specific 16S rRNA PCRs. Carriage of Brachyspira spp. was determined in individuals from rural areas of Western Australia (WA) with gastrointestinal symptoms, (including 151 Aboriginal and 142 non-Aboriginal Australians), 227 migrants to Australia, and 90 healthy control individuals from Perth, Western Australia. When samples were assessed by culture, B. pilosicoli was isolated from the faeces of 10.6% of migrant and 9.9% of Aboriginal Australian individuals. B. pilosicoli carriage was significantly higher in Aboriginal children aged 2 - 4 years (P = 0.0027) and migrants of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin (P = 0.0034). Carriage in each population was associated with the detection of a number of intestinal parasites. It was not clear whether an association existed between B. pilosicoli isolation and disease, as similar proportions were found in sick Aboriginal patients and presumably healthy migrant individuals. B. pilosicoli may have caused disease in Aboriginal children where other pathogens were not present, or may have contributed to disease with known or suspected pathogens. In particular, colonisation was significantly more frequent in individuals with chronic diarrhoea or failure to thrive (FTT) (P = 0.016), and was also increased in elderly patients. The association of B. pilosicoli with parasites may have been due to behavioural factors, or an as yet unknown relationship between the organisms. B. aalborgi was not isolated from the specimens of rural individuals or migrants, as culture media and conditions for this organism were not optimal, but was thought to have been the spirochaetes seen by microscopy in culture negative samples. As a result, a more appropriate isolation medium for B. aalborgi was developed, containing brain heart infusion agar with 10% bovine blood, spectinomycin and polymyxin B. One isolate of B. aalborgi was obtained on this medium, from a control individual with self-reported chronic diarrhoea. The colonial, phase contrast and electron microscopic morphologies of two cell types present in the sample were described, and partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained. However, even with the modified media, other samples in this population contained spirochaetes that could not be cultured. 

PCR conducted on DNA extracted by the Qiagen QIAmp column method was more suitable for determining the prevalence of Brachyspira spp. in these specimens. B. pilosicoli was detected in higher proportions by PCR, in 15.0% of migrants and 14.5% of Aboriginals, but again not in symptomatic or healthy non-Aboriginal Australians. Detection of B. pilosicoli by PCR changed the identification of risk factors only a little; detection of protozoa in migrants, and protozoa, G. intestinalis, H. nana in Aboriginals were no longer associated with B. pilosicoli detection. B. aalborgi DNA was detected in 7.9% of migrants, 6.9% of Aboriginals, 5.6% of non-Aboriginal patients, and 5.6% of controls. Approximately equal proportions were obtained from migrant individuals from African, Middle Eastern and Eastern European countries. Both spirochaete species were detected in migrants (5.6%) and Aboriginal Australians (4.1%), and carriage of one spirochaete was significantly associated with carriage of the other spirochaete in both populations (P &lt;0.001). These data suggest that the two Brachyspira spp. have a different epidemiology, and that B. aalborgi may be distributed at a similar prevalence in many human populations.

Carriage of B. aalborgi was associated with larger family size in migrants (P &lt;0.001), and if a family member was positive, it was significantly more likely that other family members would be colonised (P = 0.008). Two colonised control individuals also came from the same family, all suggesting that transmission of B. aalborgi can occur between family members. Carriage of B. aalborgi was significantly higher in Aboriginal patients aged 2 - 18 y, and in non-Aboriginal patients aged &gt;18 y and between 60 - 69 y. Detection was associated with various parasites in Aboriginals, but only protozoans in migrants (P = 0.014). Detection of B. aalborgi was associated with diarrhoea in non- Aboriginals (P = 0.048), with an absence of diarrhoea (P = 0.016) amongst Aboriginals, and with eosinophilia, weight loss, being underweight and suspected worms in this group also (P &lt;0.001). Whether B. aalborgi was a cause of these symptoms, or was excreted as a result of the symptoms caused by some other source, was unknown. The pathogenic significance ofB. aalborgi also could not be resolved in this investigation, as similar proportions were detected in ill and healthy individuals, and detection was associated with different reasons for investigation in the two ill population groups. B. aalborgi could be a commensal in the human gastrointestinal tract, or may have the capacity to cause disease under certain circumstances, such as in individuals with poor immune status, or in a conducive gut microenvironment.

PCR products were sequenced to attempt to differentiate between B. aalborgi strains. All except five strains were identical to the type strain, three had nucleotide changes that placed them in cluster 3 described by Pettersson et al. (2000), another strain shared similarity with cluster 2 or 3 strains and the final strain remained in cluster 1. More complete sequencing of this gene, or the use of another sequence based typing method, such as multi-locus sequence typing, would be useful to further investigate the molecular epidemiology of B. aalborgi carriage in human populations. A comparison between techniques for intestinal spirochaete detection was made. 

PCR was the most successful method for detecting spirochaetes in faeces, with a lower limit of detection of B. pilosicoli in seeded faeces at 1 x 106 organism/g and 1 x 105 organism/g for B. aalborgi. Microscopy was inadequate for identifying the spirochaetes, and lacked sensitivity, with only 1 x 107 - 1 x 105 organisms/g of seeded faeces visible in this way. Culture was adequate for B. pilosicoli, with isolation possible from seeded faeces containing 1 x 102 &#168;C 2 x 103 cfu/g. Culture was inadequate for B. aalborgi detection, despite isolation from seeded faeces at 2 x 104 cfu/g, and advances made to isolation media for this spirochaete in the course of this investigation.

There were concerns that B. pilosicoli spirochaetaemia might be occurring in Western Australian populations with a high rate of intestinal carriage, but going undiagnosed. An evaluation of the blood culture systems commonly used in Australia indicated that the automated BACTEC system using the BACTEC plus Anaerobic/F bottle was best for the detection of B. pilosicoli in seeded blood. A protocol longer than the 5 d normally utilised by clinical laboratories was required to detect the organism when seeded at low concentrations. Both manual H&#168;&#166;moline and Septi-Chek media were as reliable as the BACTEC for B. pilosicoli growth, however detection in these systems required frequent subculture, and was thus time-consuming and laborious. The automated BacT/Alert system performed poorly both for detection and recovery of B. pilosicoli, and medium and algorithmic components were probable contributing factors. BACTEC Plus Anaerobic/F bottles inoculated with blood from 801 patients thought to be at risk for blood infection with B. pilosicoli were cultured for 14 d, or 21 d after transport from rural centres. No isolate was obtained from these individuals, but there were some problems inherent in the investigation. However, while bacteraemia with B. pilosicoli is clearly a rare medical event, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in immunocompromised individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms, and possibly in groups with high rates of intestinal carriage of B. pilosicoli.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, utilising MluI and SmaI restriction enzymes, was used to examine the relationships between B. pilosicoli isolates collected from Aboriginal and migrant individuals, and some pre-existing strains. In migrants, isolates were distributed throughout the dendrogram created after analysis with MluI; however, the migrants had originated from 10 countries around the world. Two B. pilosicoli isolates from two individuals from the same family were closely related, indicating that exposure from a common source or transmission from one individual to another might have occurred. As no other isolate from migrants were related, even among members of other families, transmission between family members did not appear to be common.

Strains from Australian Aboriginals were also distributed throughout the MluI dendrogram, but the majority (89.7%) were clustered in one of six clonal groups. Isolates were obtained from different locations and years of sampling, supporting previous observations that B. pilosicoli colonising Aboriginal people have an epidemic population structure (Trott et al., 1998). An explanation for the presence of clonal groups was not clear. Increased virulence of isolates may have contributed to the spread of B. pilosicoli clones in WA Aboriginals. All isolates from hospitalised individuals, and those obtained from samples where no other pathogen was detected were members of clonal groups, however, no isolate from healthy Aboriginals was included in the investigation. Resistance to one or more antimicrobial also may have favoured selection for and spread of clonal isolates in the Aboriginal population.

The antimicrobial susceptibility of 139 B. pilosicoli isolates was obtained by a procedure modified from the NCCLS agar dilution method (NCCLS, 1990). Strains were generally sensitive to agents tested, but variably resistant to clindamycin and amoxicillin, depending on the source of strains. Over 50% of strains contained a &#166;&#194;-lactamase that was inhibited by clavulanic acid. Significantly higher proportions of isolates from Aboriginal Australians (P &lt;0.001) contained a &#166;&#194;-lactamase than other isolates, while no isolate from PNG natives did (P &lt;0.001), nor was any isolate from this population resistant to any other antimicrobial. Isolates from pigs and homosexuals demonstrated raised MICs for tetracycline and resistance to amoxicillin and clindamycin. All Aboriginal isolates in clonal groups contained a &#166;&#194;-lactamase, as did other isolates not classified within clonal groups. Further analysis of the virulence characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates is required.

Based on susceptibility results and success in previous studies, metronidazole was a potential choice for treatment of HIS, and to remove intestinal carriage of B. pilosicoli. For therapy in spirochaetaemia, intravenous ceftriaxone or Timentin would be preferred over penicillin antibiotics in view of the frequent occurrence of resistance. Carriage of spirochaetes is currently going unrecognised in Australian laboratories, as current protocols do not specifically target their detection, and current medical opinion remains ambivalent about their significance. Detection by any of culture, microscopy, PCR is not difficult, and could be implemented to examine faecal specimens during investigations of individuals with chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, or in children who are failing to thrive.

In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis examined a range of issues relating to the epidemiology of intestinal spirochaetes in humans. The prevalence of B. aalborgi and B. pilosicoli was determined in faeces by microscopy, culture and PCR. The spirochaetes were present in both healthy and ill individuals, at around 15% for B. pilosicoli and 6% for B. aalborgi. Each organism was associated with specific risk factors in the populations assessed. The prevalence of bacteraemia with B. pilosicoli was examined, but no episode was identified in the study. The molecular epidemiology of B. pilosicoli was analysed using PFGE. MIC data were determined for B. pilosicoli and based on these, therapies for infections with this organism were suggested. Similar studies on B. aalborgi are now required to provide a more complete understanding of the epidemiology of this organism in humans.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040520.162740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching for Safe Text: Transfers on to the Infobahn</field><field name="creator">pasqur@perth.training.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">&#147;Searching for safe text&#148; is the main title of the dissertation, and also refers to the
process involved in writing (and reading) it. &#147;Transfers on to the Infobahn&#148; is the subtitle, which applies the guiding metaphor of movement to the central concept of transfer, used to explain potentially unsafe text, and to its application in cyberspace, seen as a further step from off-line experiences.

The research is on difficulties in interaction associated with differences in background languages and cultures, with an increasingly narrow focus on trans-cultural computer mediated communication using written text, mainly in English. The thesis investigates whether and how forms of linguistic interference, particularly negative transfers, lead to unsafe text and serious misunderstandings, which negatively affect interactions.

Aims of the project include increased awareness of the characteristics and problems of both media and messages, and promotion of basic skills and tools to recognise, resolve, reduce and prevent such misunderstandings, to supplement broadly applicable (trans-)linguistic and transcultural communication capabilities. For this research I have collected, analysed, evaluated and compared many relevant examples, which are mostly compatible with online settings, to illustrate problems and promote approaches to their resolution. The most serious outcomes are in areas which impact on basic human needs and values, such as life, liberty and self-esteem, and involving the notion of face, also in the context of linguistic conventions of politeness.

This work brings a lifelong interest in forms of transfer between different languages to the new and rapidly evolving arena of computer-mediated communication, with primary concern for interaction difficulties involving native and non-native users of a supposedly &#145;common&#146; language. Attention to polyglots, though not exclusive, intends to highlight the often ignored issues of differences in background languages, particularly within the wide and varied English-speaking world. The challenges range from ethical concerns for equity, access and diversity in multicultural societies to economic needs for competitiveness and effectiveness in the international arena.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040520.163726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revision of Acanthopleura Guilding, 1829 (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) based on light and electron microscopy.</field><field name="creator">lbrooker@usc.edu.au</field><field name="description">Light and scanning electron microscopy have been utilized to further resolve the taxonomic status of the genus Acanthopleura Guilding, 1829 (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) following Ferreira&#146;s 1986 controversial revision, which synonymised four well-established genera and numerous species. Specimens of the 19 nominal species of the genus Acanthopleura, together with those from five widely disparate, geographic populations of one of these species (A. gemmata), along with specimens of the outgroup, Onithochiton quercinus Gould, 1846), have been utilised.

A consideration of gross morphological characters, including features of the valves, girdle armature and gills, clearly separate A. rehderi from Acanthopleura, aligning it with Onithochiton. They also suggest the synonymy of two pairs of species (A. haddoni/A. vaillantii and A. testudo/A. brevispinosa), and indicate that A. loochooana is closely aligned with species previously assigned to Squamopleura (A. araucariana, A. curtisiana and A. miles).

Examination of microstructural characters of the intermediate valve, including features of the tegmental micro architecture, the ocelli, the aesthetes and the central anterior eaves, confirm the conclusions of the gross morphological study, and, in addition, indicate a close relationship between A. echinata and A. nigra.

Investigation of the girdle armature indicates that Acanthopleura can be divided into four groups based on the possession of predominantly scales, spines, spinelets or spicules. However, there is wide intraspecific variation with regard to micro  architecture of the girdle elements. This section confirms the close relationships of A. haddoni/A. vaillantii and A. testudo/A. brevispinosa, and suggests affiliations between other species.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxnomy</field><field name="subject">Mollusc</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040520.164424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the Metal containing Granules in the Mussels, Mytilus Galloprovincialis and Velesunio Angasi</field><field name="creator">jstanley@kisser.net.au</field><field name="description">There is a continuing need to develop a simple and reliable biomonitoring technique for pollutants in aquatic systems.

In order to assess the suitability of lysosomal kidney granules for such a role, it must be established that they are involved in the accumulation and detoxification of pollutants, and the range of change within the granules must also be assessed. 

The structure and composition of intracellular metal-containing granules extracted from the kidney of the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from a non-polluted site have been examined using a variety of techniques. Comparisons were made between granules extracted from these mussels and those loaded with zinc in the laboratory, and those exposed to excess levels of zinc in the field. In addition, intracellular and extracellular metal-containing granules have been extracted from the freshwater mussel, Velesunio angasi and examined using similar techniques. 

Granules isolated from the kidney tissue of fifty M. galloprovincialis (using a centrifugation process) were pooled to produce a single sample. Inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) revealed that the concentration of zinc in the kidney granules increased with the level of zinc-loading from a mean value of 5 260 &#181;g.g-1 in freshly harvested animals to 12 487 &#181;g.g-1 in animals loaded with 2.5 &#181;g.g-1 zinc for 28 days. The other main elements present in the granules were phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, calcium, iron and copper. Granules from mussels exposed to excess zinc in the field had a greater concentration of zinc (13 570 &#181;g.g-1) than both field control animals (1 424 &#181;g.g-1) and the mussels loaded at the highest level of zinc in the laboratory. Silicon was also present in the granules extracted from the field-contaminated mussels.
 
Both light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of kidney tissue from M. galloprovincialis loaded with zinc in the laboratory showed signs of increasing degeneration as the level of zinc-loading increased. All cells examined contained membrane-bound granules. The kidney tissue of the field-contaminated mussels, despite containing high levels of zinc and many granules, showed no signs of degeneration. 

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the granules revealed that they were spherical in shape, while energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of the isolated granules confirmed the results of the ICP analysis with regard to elemental composition. TEM also revealed that the granules themselves underwent structural changes as the level of zinc-loading increased. Thus, granules extracted from freshly harvested animals were electron-dense and regular in shape while zinc-loading produced granules with a concentric ring formation. In kidney tissue from mussels that were maintained in clean seawater for 14 days following 28 days of zinc-loading, the majority of the granules visible had the concentric ring formation. Granules with concentric rings were not found in kidney cells of the field-contaminated mussels. The number of multivesicular bodies in individual kidney cells also increased during zinc-loading and a positive relationship exists between the number of these bodies and the mean diameter of the granules in the cells. 

The lack of degeneration in the cells of the kidney tissue in the field-contaminated mussels is almost certainly due to the fact that these animals were subjected to a chronic excess of zinc, rather than an acute dose as occurred in the laboratory-loaded animals. Presumably, this longer time period allows the animal to adapt and establish defence mechanisms, including the production of granules. 

The acute exposure to zinc, combined with the stress of being kept in the laboratory, may also have resulted in the appearance of granules with concentric rings in the laboratory zinc-loaded mussels. 

In the freshwater mussel Velesunio angasi, extracellular granules were found mainly on the labial palps, mantle edge, gills and the junction between the foot and the visceral mass. ICP of pooled granules and EDS analysis of isolated granules showed that calcium, phosphorus, iron, manganese and barium were the major elements present.  Two types of intracellular granules were isolated from the kidney cells of V. angasi, the first time this has been recorded. The first was similar in composition to the extracellular granules and it was hypothesised that these two groups of granules are actually insoluble deposits of metal phosphates, despite being membrane-bound in the kidney cells. The second type of intracellular granule was mainly composed of phosphorus and sulphur and was possibly lysosomal. 

It appears that difficulties with extraction of the granules and the analysis of the samples preclude the use of the metal-containing kidney granules of either M. galloprovincialis or V. angasi as biomarkers. The use of other biomarkers for pollutant contamination in mussels is discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040528.124219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Localised splitting criteria for classification and regression trees</field><field name="creator">A.Bremner@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a modification of existing entropy-based splitting criteria for classification and regression trees. Trees are typically grown using splitting criteria that choose optimal splits without taking future splits into account. This thesis examines localised splitting criteria that are based on local averaging in regression trees or local proportions in classification trees. The use of a localised criterion is motivated by the fact that future splits result in leaves that contain local observations, and hence local deviances provide a better approximation of the deviance of the fully grown tree. While most recent research has focussed on tree-averaging techniques that are aimed at taking a moderately successful splitting criterion and improving its predictive power, this thesis concentrates on improving the splitting criterion.

Use of a localised splitting criterion captures local structures and enables later splits to capitalise on the placement of earlier splits when growing a tree. Using the localised splitting criterion results in much simpler trees for pure interaction data (data with no main effects) and can produce trees with fewer errors and lower residual mean deviances than those produced using a global splitting criterion when applied to real data sets with strong interaction effects.

The superiority of the localised splitting criterion can persist when multiple trees are grown and averaged using simple methods. Although a single tree grown using the localised splitting criterion can outperform tree averaging using the global criterion, generally improvements in predictive performance are achieved by utilising the localised splitting criterion's property of detecting local discontinuities and averaging over sets of trees grown by placing splits where the deviance is locally minimal. Predictive performance improves further when the degree of localisation of the splitting criterion is randomly selected and weighted randomisation is used with locally minimal deviances to produce sets of trees to average over. Although state of the art methods quickly average very large numbers of trees, thus making the performance of the splitting criterion less critical, predictive performance when the localised criterion is used in bagging indicates that different splitting methods warrant investigation.

The localised splitting criterion is most useful for growing one tree or a small number of trees to examine structure in the data. Structurally different trees can be obtained by simply splitting the data where the localised splitting criterion is locally optimal.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local splits</field><field name="subject">local deviance</field><field name="subject">tree averaging</field><field name="subject">exploratory data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040606.142949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of fire on the honey possum Tarsipes rostratus in the Fitzgerald River National Park, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">aeveraardt@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The honey possum Tarsipes rostratus is a tiny (7 - 12 g) highly specialised flower-feeding marsupial endemic to the south-western corner of Australia.  The impact of fire on this small mammal was studied, over a 19-year period, in the Fitzgerald River National Park, a large (330,000 ha) area of relatively undisturbed heathland/shrubland, rich in the proteaceous and myrtaceous plants upon which the honey possum appears to rely for food.  The honey possum is the most abundant and widespread mammal in this Park.   

Capture rates of honey possums were significantly related to the years since the vegetation was last burnt, annual rainfall in the preceding (but not the current) year, the season when trapping occurred, and the trapping grid operated.  Capture rates declined markedly after fire and remained low (less than one third of those in long unburnt vegetation) for about 4 - 5 years following a fire.  Rates of capture then increased steadily over the next 20 - 25 years, with maximal abundance recorded about 30 years after fire.  Thereafter, there appeared to be a slight decline in capture rates, but even in the vegetation unburnt for longest (&gt; 50 years since fire), honey possum abundance was substantial and relatively stable.  In contrast to these changes in abundance, the structure of the honey possum population, with 79 % adults and 57 % males, appeared little influenced by fire history, annual rainfall, season or grid.  

The increase in the rates of capture of honey possums following fire paralleled the pattern of availability of cover in the vertical and, to a lesser extent, horizontal plane.  Indeed, projective foliage cover took around 20 years after fire to reach levels similar to those available in areas unburnt for even longer.  The trend in capture rates was also congruent with the maturation of the most frequently visited foodplants of honey possums, particularly Banksia nutans (summer flowering) and B. baueri (winter flowering).  Areas long unburnt still contained shelter and foodplants adequate for honey possums even 50 years or more after fire, with only slight evidence of senescence.

Pollen loads indicated that honey possums caught in burnt areas, where their preferred foodplants were absent, continued to feed on these favoured foodplants (Banksia and Dryandra spp.) at nearby unburnt areas.  In addition, they also fed, in both burnt and long unburnt areas, upon a suite of other plant species that regenerated more rapidly from lignotubers and epicormic buds, as well as from seeds (e.g. Eucalyptus and Calothamnus spp.).  Thus, honey possums appeared to persist with their preferences for feeding from a limited number of flowering plants despite some of these species not being available in recently burnt areas for many years.  Nearby patches of unburnt vegetation can clearly be important refuges, feeding grounds and shelter for the few honey possums that visit recently burnt areas, and appear to be the source of honey possum colonists in the years following a fire.  

Capture rates were also greater following years when rainfall was higher than average.  Indeed, rainfall had as great an influence upon capture rates as time since fire.  Capture rates were also consistently higher over winter, and to a lesser extent over summer, than in either autumn or spring.  Individual grids, even those close together in apparently similar vegetation with a similar fire history, still differed significantly overall in their capture rates of honey possums.  This last finding has implications for the use of chronosequences in the study of post-fire changes in biota.

Although not the primary focus of the study, data on the limited suite of other, far less abundant, small mammals present indicated that house mouse Mus musculus domesticus numbers peak soon after fire (about two years after fire), grey-bellied dunnart Sminthopsis griseoventer numbers somewhat later (about eight years after fire) and that southern bush rats Rattus fuscipes fiuscipes, like honey possums, are later successional species.  Most species were present in vegetation over a range of post-fire ages, with data consistent with models based on sequential changes in relative abundance.

Like many Australian mammals, the range of the honey possum has contracted substantially over the last 200 years and the coastal heathlands of the south-west are its last stronghold.  In terms of its conservation, this study indicates that, if possible, management burns in these heathlands should be separated by intervals of at least 20 years between successive burns, and preferably even longer.  If burns are required more frequently to meet other management priorities, it is highly preferable that they are small and patchy, rather than large scale.  Such practices may help ensure the long-term survival of this unique, highly specialised and endemic marsupial.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">honey possum</field><field name="subject">Tarsipes rostratus</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">rainfall</field><field name="subject">mark-recapture</field><field name="subject">small mammals</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040611.105120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meeting Your Depth</field><field name="creator">30021222@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As a member of the Stolen Generations, my objective and design in this dissertation is part of a larger project, involving the reclamation of my Aboriginal identity, taken from me as a child.

This thesis makes a contribution to this previously unexplored area by providing a descriptive profile of current professors at Australian universities and an insight into female professors&#146; perspectives on how they managed their entry into the Australian professoriate. It responds to the twin central questions: &#147;Who are the female occupants in the Australian professoriate and how have they managed their way through the academic hierarchy?&#148;

A profile of current female Australian professors, constructed via a questionnaire, provides the study with a foundation -- a background from which to view the interpretative data. This part of the research also makes a contribution to the social arithmetic of higher education, by presenting systematic demographic information on female professors in Australian universities. Subsequently 13 in-depth interviews were conducted, giving a &#147;voice&#148; to the professors. This enabled the research to identify and explore six major themes - career, role, significant others, gender, change, and reflection.

The thesis presents the data collected in the questionnaire and interviews, discusses and interprets the research findings, and provides an insight into the milieu in which the female professors function. It includes an overview of some of the critical literature pertinent to the topic - female professors and their working lives - from both an Australian and an international perspective. It also details the methodology used in the study, which included both quantitative and qualitative research tools, and describes the theoretical position which frames the qualitative part of the research, symbolic interactionism, which is located within the hermeneutic/interpretive paradigm in social research.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040621.121950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Environmentally Based Approach to Tourism Planning</field><field name="creator">r.dowling@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the evolving relationship between the environment and tourism and argues for a new environmentally based regional tourism planning approach.  In environmental planning the major aim is to foster environmental protection and conservation, whereas the goals of tourism planning are to engender tourism promotion and area development.  This study seeks to determine whether or not the two approaches can be combined to institute both environmental conservation and tourism development, that is to bring about sustainable tourism development.  It is argued that the two can be integrated through a traditional tourism planning approach underpinned by environmental planning methods.  The research then proposes a new environmentally based tourism planning model which is tested in Western Australia.  

The evolution of the environment &#150; tourism relationship is traced over the last four decades.  The advent of mass tourism since World War 11 is related to growing global environmental awareness.  Two aspects of the environment &#150; tourism relationship are identified and described.  The first is that the environment and tourism have symbiotic and even synergistic possibilities in which the relationship is mutually beneficial.  The second is that they are in conflict and that tourism is destroying its very foundations.  The conclusion is drawn that elements of both symbiosis and conflict are ever present in the environment &#150; tourism relationship.  Therefore, it is suggested that the symbiotic or ideal view be tempered by the realistic acceptance of tourism and the environment&#146;s potential and actual conflicts. This in itself leads to an integrative approach which minimizes adverse impacts and enhances positive outcomes through integrated planning and management. 

Having established the integrative link between tourism and the environment, tourism and area development planning models are then briefly reviewed as well as those applicable to environmental conservation and protection planning.  Parallels are drawn between the two planning approaches especially in relation to social and spatial components.  It is then argued that the future of environment &#150; tourism planning is based on environmental conservation, the incorporation of community and tourist views and the recognition of functional differentiation.  It is asserted that the planning of natural areas for tourism should begin from an environmental base and work forwards towards the identification of tourism opportunities; include the views of community groups and tourists, especially in regard to the environment &#150; tourism relationship; and conclude with a plan which embraces the spatial features of both environmental and tourism nodes, corridors and hinterlands.  

A new regional sustainable development framework called Environmentally Based Tourism (EBT) Planning Model is described.  It is grounded in environmental conservation and seeks to advance environmentally compatible tourism through the identification of significant features, critical areas and compatible activities. Although incorporating aspects of the rational approach to planning, the role of people as part of the ecosystem is emphasized, and part of the process.  Zoning is used to maintain environmental and tourism values and includes the following zones:  sanctuary, nature conservation, outdoor recreation and tourism destination.  

This thesis is explored on two levels; by the generation of the environmentally based tourism planning model and then through its application to a regional case study in Western Australia (WA). The medal was tested in the Gascoyne Region of WA from 1989-1991. Extant environmental and tourism data were combined with face-to-face surveys of residents and tourists.  Following analysis, the central conclusion is that the model is a useful tool in integrating environmental and tourism goals.  Limitations of the study include the contextual integration of environmental and social values, the lack of comprehensive environmental data, and the attempt to bring together disparate planning approaches.  However, overall the model helps bridge the rational &#150; values orientated planning gap and assists in the identification of environment - tourism planning parameters.  Finally, further research opportunities are identified especially in relation to the selection of appropriate data.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040621.135456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of research on Codex Bezae, with special reference to the Acts of the Apostles: evaluation and future directions</field><field name="creator">kpanten@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Considering the amount of material written on Codex Bezae down through the centuries a detailed history of research into the codex has long been overdue. Such a history is important not only to give future researchers an understanding of what has gone on before,. but also to facilitate an understanding of the development of ideas and their outcome. As Codex Bezae is the principal witness of the so-called Western text, much of what has been written centres upon its text. Nevertheless from the end of the last century there has been a growing awareness among scholars of the need to give the other details contained within the codex far more attention than hitherto.

Inasmuch as the D text is the main rival to the Alexandrian text as the best representative of the otiginal exemplar, it is of no surprise that Codex Bezae and its text have been of interest to the textual critics. Over the last century and a half there have always been those advocating the supremacy of the D text, and such claims have attracted much attention. For this reason, Codex Bezae has never been far from the focus of scholarly debate. This debate would be greatly helped if Codex Bezae could be accurately located historically, for this, briefly, is the nub of the problem - where and when was it written? Any avenue of inquiry ever pursued, any investigation ever embarked upon, has the answer to this question as its prime objective. Hence the importance of this history, for we need to know how the debate has progressed if we are to avoid repeating previous fruitless enterprises and if we wish to build upon previous fruitful endeavours.

Having established the history of research on Codex Bezae it was opportune to assess the claims and counterclaims, to sift the data, and to separate the more factual evidence from the many hypotheses, in order to establish a solid base from which to launch future inquiries.

Consequently this thesis provides:
1. a detai]ed history of the research on Codex Bezae;
2. an analysis of the existing evidence;
3. a detailed catalogue of scholars who have contributed to the debate;
4. details of my own investigations into the historical    use of unusually spelled words in the Bezan text; and
5. suggested avenues for future research.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040624.93526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance measurement of Australian geoscientific  minerals researchers in the changing funding regimes</field><field name="creator">k.smith@curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the performance of geoscience minerals researchers from three Australian geoscientific research centres. The study explores whether the changing funding regimes for geoscientific research in Australia have impacted on the research performance of these geoscientists, measured through analysis of activity and output. The context of the study is the literature outlining the settings for the general culture of geoscientific research and the Australian scientific policy and research environment, in particular, including an evaluation of bibliometric methods.

The case study of three geoscience minerals research centres and their researchers finds that journal and book publishing is only one component of the researchers' performance and that conferences, technical reports as well as teaching have an important place in the dissemination of research results. The study also finds that the use of the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) indices not only influences the policy directions for scientific and geoscientific research funding in Australia, but also directs the ways in which the geoscientists publish. It also tends to restrict publishing output: the tail wags the dog.

The study recommends: that the various ways through which research outcomes are disseminated, as well as other components of the research continuum including the processes of education and professional activity, receive wider acceptance and recognition in Australian government policy; that the Australian geoscientific community re-assess its educational and research directions through a considered auditing and strategic planning process; and that a more comprehensive approach to the dissemination of geoscientific research outcomes into the public domain be enacted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geoscience</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040625.122025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edge Effects and birds across karri forest (Eucalyptus diversicolor) clear-fell edges: A study of theory and conservation management.</field><field name="creator">Penelope Ingrid Atkinson</field><field name="description">Theoretical and empirical studies on logging impacts internationally indicate that edges between mature forest and regrowth may alter the abundance and distribution of fauna, with implications for biodiversity conservation. The south-west Western Australian karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forest bird community is characterised by high degrees of endemism, cooperative breeding and reliance on nest hollows. It may therefore show different responses to clearfelled edges than bird communities in Northern Hemisphere forests, where most edge studies have been carried out.

The term &#147;Edge Effect&#148; was originally defined specifically as an increase in abundance and diversity at the edge but has since been used indiscriminately to describe any change in distribution across an edge, confusing any assessment of the types and prevalence of these changes. For clarity, in this thesis the term &#147;Edge Response&#148; was used to describe the response of a community, guild or species to edges, and the term &#147;Edge Effect&#148; restricted to its original definition. I surveyed the international literature to determine the types and prevalence of community level changes in bird distribution across edges. Edge Effects at the community level are not common internationally, while there are many other documented types of edge response. Foraging or functional guilds can differ in their edge responses, and at the species level, edge responses have been demonstrated to differ between habitats for the same species, and may also change seasonally.

Therefore, I monitored the distribution of birds at the Community, Guild and Species levels across replicated clear-fell edges (120m and 60m into regrowth, at  the edge and 60m into mature forest) between mature forest and 1) Establishment regrowth, 2) Juvenile regrowth and 3) mature forest (control, no edge) in three karri forest areas over four seasons (one year), and one forest area over eight seasons (two IV years). A five minute count of birds within each 30m radius circular plot was repeated approximately five times each season (108 plots in the first year, 36 plots over two years). Mean values of abundance (for the whole bird community and for individual species) and diversity measures for each census point were calculated and analysed with repeated measures ANOVA. Bird behavioural and vegetation data and Mist-netting captures across edges were also investigated. 

My aims were to 1) describe and quantify any edge-related changes in the distribution and abundance of the birds 2) suggest possible explanations for the patterns observed and 3) propose management actions to minimise negative impacts.

There was no Community Edge Effect. The bird community as a whole did not respond to edges themselves, but was most abundant where mature forest was present (including at edges), least abundant and diverse in Establishment regrowth and intermediate in abundance and diversity in Juvenile regrowth. Guilds were poor predictors of species edge responses. Only the Nectarivores showed a unified response to edges &#150; all five species avoided regrowth and four species avoided Juvenile edges. The Granivore/Frugivore guild and the whole Insectivore guild were less abundant in regrowth than in mature forest but did not have higher or lower abundance at the edge. Insectivorous species&#146; edge responses were diverse and not reliably attributed to foraging-strata guilds (Understorey; Shrub; Canopy; All-Levels; Aerial; Bark). The Tree Martin, an Aerial foraging insectivore, showed an Edge Effect at Establishment edges in the first year of the study only. Individual vegetation variables were poor predictors of bird species distributions but overall, floristics changed with forest area not with edge distance, while habitat structural variables varied with edge, forest age and distance from the edge indicating that overall, structural variables were most strongly related to bird edge responses. The proportion of trees of 10-24cm diameterwas highest at Juvenile edges, which were avoided by four Nectarivore species and the bark-foraging Rufous Treecreeper.

Ordination grouped bird species by six edge response categories &#150;Avoid edges; Prefer edges; Prefer Mature-forest; Prefer Mature-forest/Juvenile-regrowth; Prefer Establishment-regrowth; Neutral. However for individual species, these edge responses changed both temporally and spatially, emphasising the need for edge studies to be well replicated in both time and space. Some bird species  also showed behavioural changes across edges. Species potentially disadvantaged by the creation of clear-fell edges are those avoiding Juvenile edges (Purple-crowned Lorikeet, New Holland Honeyeater, White-naped Honeyeater, Little Wattlebird and Rufous Treecreeper), and those most abundant in Mature forest habitat, but which show great spatial variation in abundance and therefore have unclear responses to edges (Whitebrowed Babbler, Restless Flycatcher). Several management options to ameliorate the effects of edge creation within production forest areas for these species will be discussed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.133615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy and Immunological Mechanisms of Type I Interferon Gene Therapy in Murine Cytomegalovirus</field><field name="creator">Emmalene J. Bartlett</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comparative analysis of the type I Interferon (IFN) subtypes and an evaluation of their potential as DNA vaccines in a model of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and disease. MCMV induces acute and chronic phases of myocarditis, a heart disease characterised by an inflammatory cell infiltrate, in susceptible BALB/c mice.

The type I IFNs comprise 14 IFN&#225; genes in the human and &gt;10 IFN&#225; genes in the mouse with a single IFN&#226; gene in both species, however, the purpose of their multiplicity has remained unclear to date. An extensive panel of murine type I IFN subtype genes, including IFNA1, A2, A4, A5, A6, A9 and B, were sub-cloned into the mammalian expression vector pkCMVint (Vical, Inc.) for expression in BALB/c mice. These DNA constructs express biologically active IFN both in vitro and in vivo with systemic, low level expression persisting in the mouse for up to 4 weeks. The individual type I IFN subtypes differentially affect the immune response to MCMV challenge. IFNA6 proved most efficacious, reducing viral replication and inflammation in the acute and chronic phase of disease. Data suggests this occurs via induction of a Th1-like cytokine and antibody response. Furthermore, IFNA6 inoculation after the acute phase was shown to protect mice from the onset of chronic myocarditis. Characterisation of the immune cell response in IFN-treated, MCMV-infected mice demonstrated that type I IFN subtypes modulate the type of immune cells infiltrating the myocardium during myocarditis. Notably, reduced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and B cell numbers in the heart was associated with reduced chronic myocarditis. Finally, coadministration of type I IFNs, in particular, IFNA6 and IFNB, synergistically improved immunotherapy against MCMV infection and myocarditis. 

The findings detailed here highlight the potential for the type I IFNs as DNA vaccines and most importantly, demonstrate that the type I IFNs have differential antiviral and immunomodulatory efficacies in the MCMV model of infection and myocarditis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.134351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of laccase by the phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani</field><field name="creator">Pranjal Bora</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the production of laccases by the phytopathogenic soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani. The fungus causes maceration of plant tissue by the production of a variety of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. Whilst most attention has focused on the role of pectinases in maceration, the laccases which degrade lignin are likely to be important in this process.

The production of laccase by the AG-11 isolate VR20 in V8 medium reached a maximum after 6 days incubation. Laccase activity was unaffected by variation in temperatures over the range 4-15&#176;C, but as the temperature increased the activity increased to a maximum at 25&#176;C. This high level activity was maintained as the temperature was increased to 37&#176;C. The effects of pH on laccase activity was also determined. Activity was stable over the pH range 4.5-6. Outside this range the activity decreased significantly.

The composition of the growth medium also had a significant effect on laccase production. Similar levels of activity were observed during growth in V8, apple pectin media, or in media containing ground up lupin hypocotyls as a carbon source. However, approx 20 fold higher levels were obtained after growth in Czapek-Dox medium.

Different laccase activity band patterns were obtained by zymogram analysis of culture supernatants. The production of the other cell wall degrading enzymes pectinase,xylanase and cellulase in these media was assessed for comparison. Whilst all three were produced in V8 and apple pectin media, cellulase was not produced in lupin medium, and none of these were produced in Czapek-Dox medium.

Attempts to increase laccase production by the addition of the reported laccase inducers CuSO4.5H2O, p-anisidine, ethanol, MnSO4.7H2O, resveratrol, and tannic acid to the growth medium showed mixed results. The only case where enhancement of synthesis was observed was with the addition of MnSO4 to Czapek-Dox medium. This compound did not enhance production in the other media tested. With the exception of p-anisidine, the other inducers had minimal effect in V8, apple pectin or lupin media. Para anisidine completely inhibited production in lupin medium. With the exception of MnSO4, all inducers inhibited laccase production in Czapek-Dox medium, with p-anisidine causing complete inhibition.

The production of xylanase and cellulase was also inhibited by these inducers but in a growth medium dependent manner. Cellulase production in V8 medium was inhibited by ethanol, MnSO4, resveratrol, and tannic acid whilst only the latter two inhibited xylanase production and none of these inhibited pectinase production. In contrast, p-anisidine had a greater inhibitory effect on pectinase and xylanase production in V8 medium than on cellulase production. Para-anisidine also inhibited xylanase (and laccase ) but not pectinase production in lupin medium but not in apple pectin medium. Resveratrol and tannic acid also inhibited xylanase production in lupin medium.The effects of the inhibitory compounds EDTA and SDS on laccase activity was determined. With SDS the % inhibition increased as the concentration of inhibitor decreased from 5% to 0.5%. With EDTA the opposite trend was observed. The effects of arginine on laccase activity was also tested. At concentrations of 0.5 to 5% arginine, laccase activity was completely inhibited.

Laccase activity was purified from the culture supernatant by anion exchange chromatography, and by electroelution from a native-PAGE gel. The degree of purification by each method was greater than 50 fold. Electrophoresis of the purified protein on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by staining with Coomassie blue showed two protein bands of 66 and 38 KDa. Measurement of the absorption spectrum of the purified protein showed two absorbance maxima, at 240 and 340nm.

Laccases produced by isolates from different anastomosis groups were analysed by staining gels for laccase activity. Variations in the band pattern were observed both between and within anastomosis groups. Analysis of single spore isolates from AG-8 and AG-11 showed segregation of band patterns. However the sample sizes were too small to make conclusions about the numbers of laccase enzymes produced by or the number of genes in the parent field isolates.

The role of laccases in maceration of lupin radicle tissue was investigated. Microscopic staining showed the presence of lignin in radicle tissue, and when incubated in the fungal enzymes the tissue lost integrity, characteristic symptoms of maceration. Maceration wasreadily observed as discolouring when the radicle was incubated in a solution of fungal enzyme. The degree of maceration was quantified by measuring the length of the discoloured region. Enzymes from all of the isolates tested caused maceration of lupin radicle. The degree of maceration ranged from 80-100%. No maceration was observed when agrinine was included in the reaction mixture. Arginine does not inhibit the activity of pectinases, xylanases, or cellulases. In maceration assays with potato tuber tissue which does not contain lignin, the addition of arginine to the reaction did not inhibit maceration. The results show that laccases are required for maceration of lignified tissue,
but not for non-lignified tissue. Laccase gene sequences were cloned from three isolates, SCR122 (AG-6), 11034 (AG-8), and VR20 (AG-11) using degenerate primers to conserved sequences to amplify the gene sequences. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. A BLAST search of the NCBI database with the derived amino acid sequences confirmed that the sequences were from laccase genes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.135422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The granule-bound starch synthase genes of wheat.</field><field name="creator">Bernadette Bradley</field><field name="description">Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the world&#146;s most widely grown and economically important crop. It is both a staple food for humans and a raw material for many industrial processes. World trade in wheat is important for economic stability and an ability to grow wheat is a valuable national resource. Wheat is Australia&#146;s major crop with an annual production of about 23 million tonnes.

One-quarter of this is used domestically and meets all of Australia&#146;s requirements; the remaining three-quarters is exported. Therefore, Australia&#146;s wheat industry provides both the national staple food source and the basis of an export industry worth almost 2 billion dollars.

There is great potential for further genetic improvement of wheat, not only by increasing grain yields by improved resistance to pathogens and tolerance to adverse environmental conditions, but also by improving functional quality. For example, one can change the physical properties of the storage components, starch and protein, to increase their usefulness in conventional applications and for novel uses. Some examples of the physical properties of starch affecting its uses are, the large starch granules from wheat that are suitable to make carbonless copy paper (Bligh, 1999), the small starch granules from rice that are used as a fat substitute because the a comparable mouthfeel, the high-amylose starches that have film-forming properties desirable for fried food coating batters and some forms of plastics, and the low-amylose starch that swells more in water and can be used for soft foods such as Asian noodles. Continued improvement of wheat is vital to meet the quantity and quality demands of the local and international wheat markets.

One specialty market for Western Australian wheat, is export to Japan and South Korea for the production of Japanese white salted Udon noodles, an export market worth more than $200M pa (Garlinge, 1996). Udon noodles have specific eating qualities including a light, creamy, uniform colour, a &#145;bright&#146; appearance to the noodle, a soft but elastic texture to the noodle, and a smooth &#145;mouthfeel&#146;, all of which result from the quality of the wheat flour starch they are made from(Crosbie, 1991; Batey et al., 1997; Zeng et al., 1997). The Australian Standard White Noodle (ASWN) wheat that Australia exports to produce Udon noodles is soft-grained, white coloured, contains between 9.5% and 11.5% protein, and produces flour of fine particle size with little starch damage (V. Reck, DAWA, pers. comm.). The flour also has good starch-swelling characteristics, moderate dough strength and good dough extensibility.

The good starch-swelling characteristics of the flour result, for the most-part, from containing relatively less of the starch amylose than other varieties (22-23% compared to 25%), a property controlled by the GBSS genes (Nelson and Rines, 1962; Garlinge, 1996). When less amylose is present in the starch granule as it is heated in water, the amylopectin matrix inside the granule can swell, causing the finished Udon noodle to be soft. When more amylose is present in the starch granule, the amylopectin matrix cannot swell as much, and the finished noodle is too hard to have the desired &#145;mouthfeel&#146; of an Udon noodle. The amylose fraction of starch is produced by the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) enzymes, encoded by the GBSS genes. The overall aim of the research described in this thesis was to investigate the genomic organization of the GBSS genes of wheat. Since the GBSS genes influence wheat starch quality, an understanding of the action of these genes is needed for future improvement of starch quality in noodle-wheats.

There are three loci for GBSS genes in wheat, and these are located on chromosomes 4A, 7A and 7D. Both wild-type alleles and non-functional &#145;null&#146; alleles exist at each locus. At the start of the project, these alleles had not been sequenced and the molecular differences between the alleles were not known. Other GBSS alleles were also thought to exist in Australian varieties that had yet to be identified and characterised. GBSS genes from a selection of wheat varieties, and from all three GBSS loci, were sequenced searching for DNA polymorphisms that were different between the different alleles. If any DNA polymorphisms were found to result in GBSS protein sequence differences, or differences in GBSS enzyme expression, they could influence the functional characteristics of the starch. Identifying GBSS allelic variants would enable molecular markers to be developed to detect the alleles and investigate their potential effects upon starch quality.

Different PCR-based methods and one non-PCR-based method were used to investigate the genomic organization of the GBSS genes in a selection of genetically diverse wheat varieties. The 31 wheat varieties studied included noodle-wheat varieties from the ASWN classification, varieties with similar genetic background to ASWN wheat varieties but of unsuitable quality for noodle production, unrelated varieties of Australian Standard White wheat, and were compared with those &#145;Chinese Spring&#146; varieties described in the literature. Most of the varieties are grown in the Western Australian wheatbelt and southern regions, either for export and the production of Asian noodles, or for the production of domestic baked-goods.

A 500bp section from the middle of the GBSS genes was amplified, from a selection of wheat varieties, and sequenced to search for polymorphisms. Twenty-one single nucleotide differences were found between genes at the three loci and two PCR-based tests were designed to validate these differences as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). A novel microsatellite was also discovered in intron 4 of the GBSS 7A genes. This (TGCCG)n microsatellite was variable between wheat varieties and so defines a novel allele in the Australian germplasm present at a frequency of 40%. A PCR-based test was developed to identify this variable locus. However, the new GBSS allele was not linked to Flour Swelling Volume (FSV) quality properties.

The variable microsatellite locus Xsun1 (Shariflou and Sharp, 1999) in the 3&#146; untranslated region of the GBSS genes and linked to GBSS allelic variation was used to genotype a wheat breeding population for its GBSS status. The population (n=69) contained combinations of wild-type and null alleles at the 7A and 7D loci. Once genotyped using this marker, the GBSS alleles were assessed for possible likage to starch variation. Although the trend suggested that the presence ofnull alleles increased the FSV, the size of the population tested was too small for the differences in FSV between wild-type and partially-waxy wheats to be statistically significant.

The linkage between the Xsun1 microsatellite variation and the (TGCCG)n microsatellite variation from intron 4 of the GBSS 7A genes was studied. By combining these two microsatellite loci, which are closely linked to the GBSS coding regions, GBSS genes at the 7A locus could be separated into 12 allelic groups. Although none of these groups could be linked to specific changes in starch qualities, they can be analysed further for functional differences.

In order to access a larger section of the GBSS genes using PCR, new PCR primers were designed and optimized to amplify segments of the GBSS genes. Primers for GBSS genes tend to generate many PCR products, but many of these were shown to be non-specific. These artifacts could be reduced by increasing the annealing temperatures, and non-specific priming was repressed by the presence of the second primer in the PCR reaction. Using one primer set, a nearly 2000bp segment of the GBSS 7A genes from wheat varieties &#145;Kulin&#146; and &#145;Eradu&#146; was amplified and sequenced.

These sequences indicated the presence of single nucleotide differences that resulted in changed amino acids in the protein when compared to published GBSS sequences. The sequencing should be repeated to validate this result, which indicates that these are novel alleles, but it does suggest that allelic variation for GBSS exists in Australian wheat varieties and that these alleles are different from those described internationally.

The EcoR1, HindIII and BamH1 restriction enzyme sites surrounding the GBSS genes were identified using Southern hybridisation. This provided the potential to access the entire GBSS gene, including the promoter and untranscribed regions, by restriction enzyme mediated cloning of genomic DNA. However, attempts to clone the genomic GBSS genes into both plasmid and viral vectors were not successful.The potential existence of pseudogene copies of the GBSS genes in the wheat genome was investigated using both PCR and Southern hybridisation techniques. No evidence of GBSS pseudogenes was found, and this suggests that the wheat genome does not contain them. This result was unexpected since organisms with large genomes, such as wheat, normally contain repeated sequences and pseudogenes. However, the absence of repeated sequences and pseudogenes should be beneficial in molecular wheat breeding because it suggests that there will not be interference from non-coding GBSS sequences in identifying molecular markers to GBSS genes.

The GBSS genes present in Australian wheat varieties were similar enough to those described internationally that Australian breeders can make full use of research and molecular tests for GBSS genes developed elsewhere. However, enough variation exists between overseas and domestic varieties to warrant further investigation of novel GBSS alleles in domestic wheat, which may relate to differences in functionality.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.142601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physicochemical Properties of Nickel and Cobalt Sulphate Solutions of Hydrometallurgical Relevance</field><field name="creator">Ting Chen</field><field name="description">Producing nickel and cobalt metal by high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) of nickel laterites is becoming one of Australia's largest mineral processing industries. However, the background chemical information for this process, including the fundamental physicochemical properties of acidic metal sulphate leachate solutions, is not well known. In order to improve the efficiency of current and future HPAL plants, high quality physicochemical and thermodynamic data will be necessary. This thesis reports measurements on the densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions and their mixtures along with detailed studies of the nature of the species present and the thermodynamics of their interconversions.

Densities and heat capacities of nickel and cobalt sulphate and perchlorate solutions and their ternary mixtures were measured using a vibrating tube densimeter and a flow microcalorimeter respectively. These data were used to calculate the apparent molal volumes and heat capacities of these solutions. Standard partial molal quantities were then obtained by appropriate extrapolation procedures, along with the volume and heat capacity changes of ion pair formation. A comparison has been made between experimental densities and heat capacities with those predicted by Young's rule. Good agreement was obtained except when the degree of complexation varied significantly in the mixturesThe various ion pair species in nickel and cobalt sulphate solutions, along with those of magnesium sulphate (which is a major impurity in HPAL leachates), were  reinvestigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. 

Doubly solvent separated ion pairs, solvent shared ion pairs and contact ion pairs were shown to exist simultaneously in solution and their concentrations were determined from dilute to near-saturated concentrations. Evidence for the possible existence of a triple ion,
M2SO4 2+, was also obtained in highly concentrated solutions. The equilibrium constants of the stepwise reactions and the effective hydration numbers of ions and ion pairs were also calculated.

The heats of complexation of nickel(II) and cobalt(II) sulphate were determined at different ionic strengths in sodium perchlorate media by titration calorimetry. These data were fitted to a specific ion interaction model to obtain the standard state values. The corresponding entropies of complexation were calculated and were found to be the major contributor to the stability of the complexes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Cobalt Sulphate</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.144034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagination, Realisation and the Performing of Australia</field><field name="creator">Ricardo George De Vos</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that performance can be seen to constitute both a critical discipline and a set of activities entailing an engagement with spatial, temporal, physical and material relations, rather than as a product of linguistic, textual and discursive relations. As such, performance is able to critique the functioning of language, text and discourse in assuming space, time, bodies and matter. Performance also suggests ways of working on and informing writing practices. The social relations of performance pertain to times and spaces which are temporary and processual, to activities which imagine other times, spaces and people, and seek to realise them for a specific time in a specific space for a specific group of people. The social relations realised in this process of contingent realities are able to inform writing, that is, to produce writing which connects theatre with other discourses, and which connects words with bodies in time and space.

It is argued that theatre and performance&#146;s process of imagination and realisation and its engagement with spatial, temporal, physical and material relations provides a valuable site for critically examining the ways in which Australia privileges and remembers specific configurations of space, time, bodies and matter, while marginalising others, in producing official representations of the Australian nation. Such representations, reflected ingovernmental programmes such as those concerning citizenship and national security, have a bearing on how Australians view their national past, present and future, and how they perceive their social connections with each other.

Just as specific performances are made subject to the textual and discursive categories of literature and social theory, official enactments of the Australian nation are able to &#145;contain&#146; Australians who spatially, temporally
and physically transgress national boundaries. As a material practice, performance is able to engage with official enactments of the nation in order to &#145;re-open&#146; the spaces, times and encounters concealed within these sites.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040706.145537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the Recommendation Architecture Model for Text Mining</field><field name="creator">Udithaw@ou.ac.lk</field><field name="description">The Recommendation Architecture (RA) model is a new connectionist approach simulating some aspects of the human brain. Application of the RA to a real world problem is a novel research problem and has not been previously addressed in literature. Research conducted with simulated data has shown much promise for the Recommendation Architecture model&#146;s ability in pattern discovery and pattern recognition. This thesis investigates the application of the RA model for text mining where pattern discovery and recognition play an important role.

The clustering system of the RA model is examined in detail and a formal notation for representing the fundamental components and algorithms is proposed for clarity of understanding. A software simulation of the clustering system of the RA model is built for empirical studies. In the argument that the RA model is applicable for text mining the following aspects of the model are examined. With its pattern recognition ability the clustering system of the RA is adapted for text classification and text organization. As the core of the RA model is concerned with pattern discovery or identification of associative similarities in input, it is also used to discover unsuspected relationships within the content of documents. How the RA model can be applied to the problems of pattern discovery in text and classification of text is addressed demonstrating results from a series of experiments. The difficulties in applying the RA model to real life data are described and several extensions to the RA model for optimal performance are proposed from the insights obtained from experiments. Furthermore, the RA model can be extended to provide user-friendly interpretation of results. This research shows that with the proposed extensions the RA model can be successfully applied to the problem of text mining to a large extent. Some limitations exist when the RA model is applied to very noisy data, which are also demonstrated here.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recommendation architecture</field><field name="subject">text mining</field><field name="subject">pattern recognition</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040713.113844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Women From Rhodesia: An Auto-Ethnographic Study of Immigrant Experience and [Re]Aggregation in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">e.venables@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the positioning of white, English-speaking, immigrant women from Africa to Australia. I explore the effects that minimal differences have on issues of identity. Notions of identity, memory, and belonging are contrasted with white settlement in Rhodesia in the last century. My personal history and the desire to write a thesis relevant to the Australian experience led me to ask, "How do women from a privileged background, from Rhodesia and Zimbabwe, understand their experiences as immigrants to Australia?" The relevance lies in the perception that Australia is populated by immigrants and this research interrogates at a deeper level some specific issues presented by this sample group and my interpretation of their experiences augments the literature in this area. I questioned (individually) a small group of immigrants using unstructured interviews; the use of my own experiences and &#145;long/desk drawer&#146; makes the study significantly autobiographical. Notions of migration into Australia from Southern Africa are explored using theories and themes of rites de passage. I interrogate the meanings attributed to assimilation and integration in immigration and connect these to the theory. Identity, memory, and reflection are discussed in the context of separation from Africa and integration into Australia. The similarities and differences and embodied history (habitus) that shape us, interweave the trope of rites de passage, uncovering a multiplicity of identity&#151;attributed, assumed, and self-determined. I examine the ways in which Australians of Anglo-Saxon and British origin tend to position English-speaking immigrants from non-British backgrounds as outsiders and suggest that this attribution has more to do with similarities than differences. Reflection and discussion of other times and places reveals how memories intersect with &#145;new&#146; lives in Australia and the complexities of time in migration as rites de passage make possible an exploration of present experience shadowing earlier experience. Finally, I discover that identity and belonging as continually negotiated spaces are illuminated by the contrast I drew between assimilation and integration as conceptual tools in understanding the migrant experience.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Rhodesia</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">assimilation</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040713.201348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Universities as Learning Organizations: How can Australian Universities become Learning Organizations?</field><field name="creator">P.Reece@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the research issue of universities as Learning Organization. It examines the research problem of &#147;How can Australian universities become Learning Organization?&#148; This thesis presents the findings from a qualitative study of two publicly funded universities based in Western Australia, using the convergent interview and multiple case study methodology. The 11 convergent interviews were used to establish the ten key dimensions of what, the researcher considered, are necessary for Australian universities to become Learning Organization. The 32 case studies were then used to confirm or disconfirm these ten key dimensions which are listed below:
&#149; Leadership

Of the ten key dimensions examined some, such as leadership, vision, Human Resource Management and having sufficient resources, were found to be clearly important to Australian universities becoming Learning Organization. While others, such as the global reach of a university and the accessibility to a university, presented with less clear findings, but still remain as part of the overall basis for Australian universities to become Learning Organization. The findings presented in this thesis represent the combined views of 32 staff members of two West Australian universities and provide many meaningful insights to the current state of two contemporary West Australian universities; one noted primarily as a research university and the other as primarily a teaching university.

The aims were to develop protocols for controlled pollination, that could be used in clonal orchard trees to breed jarrah seedlings that have a known genetic resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi (dieback), for use in rehabilitation after mining and logging. An intimate knowledge of the breeding biology of jarrah was necessary to achieve this aim. The project also aimed to increase knowledge of the genetic diversity and structure of jarrah, in order to make informed decisions regarding the collection of material to be used for clonal propagation. Previous research has had little success in producing viable seed from any controlled pollinations, but clonal material resistant to P. cinnamomi has been produced using tissue culture. The question posed in this thesis was &#145;Can we improve breeding and propagation techniques of jarrah?&#146; 

Techniques were developed for testing of in vitro pollen viability and pollen storage, pollination and fertilisation success after controlled pollinations, including determination of stigma receptivity and development of bud isolation techniques using alfoil. The variation in female fertility between genotypes was examined. The use of paclobutrazol was explored as a method of increasing the level of viable seed production in clonal orchard trees. The use of fertiliser as well as the growth retardant was also explored to see if it increased the level of seed production even more. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and phylogeny within Eucalyptus marginata were examined using nuclear and chloroplast DNA analysis with Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphisms. 

While it was first thought that the fertilisation rate was quite low, it was confirmed that the fertilisation rate is similar to other eucalypt species. The zygote abortion rate was quite high in one clone, but one wild tree had a similar seed production rate to other eucalypt species. The zygote and endosperm appeared to be different in the clone and the wild tree observed. The level of seed production was examined in clones and wild trees and it was found that the level was often quite low, particularly in the clones (0 &#150; 13% in clones, 0 &#150; 18% in wild trees) in comparison with other Eucalyptus species, and varied between genotypes. The use of a growth retardant such as paclobutrazol may increase the production of viable seed, if it is applied during autumn. The results were inconclusive for the fertiliser/paclobutrazol experiment, since the paclobutrazol was applied during spring which was the worst time of year for increasing seed production. There were differences between genotypes in reaction to both the paclobutrazol and the fertiliser/paclobutrazol. Genetic diversity was moderate in comparison with other Eucalyptus species, and there was a low level of genetic differentiation between populations in the nuclear genome. No differentiation was observed between the morphologically recognised subspecies in the nuclear genome, but differentiation between the populations on the Swan Coastal Plain and populations on the Darling Plateau was seen in the chloroplast genome, indicating that there was historical separation of these two areas.

The conclusions arising from this work are that while controlled pollinations are possible in Eucalyptus marginata the clones that were used in these experiments have often behaved differently to the wild trees in the time of anthesis and levels of viable seed production, and in one clone (5J119) the zygote and endosperm nuclei appeared to be very different to the zygote and endosperm nuclei of a wild tree. Further investigation is necessary to see if these differences are related to the low level of seed production observed in the clonal populations. Paclobutrazol may be worth exploring further as a means of increasing seed production. Material to be used for rehabilitation and seed orchards can be collected from a wide area in the main distribution of the species, although trees on the Swan Coastal Plain are distinct from the trees in the main forest area in the chloroplast genome.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jarrah</field><field name="subject">dieback</field><field name="subject">zygote</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">paclobutrazol</field><field name="subject">RFLP</field><field name="subject">nuclear and chloroplast DNA</field><field name="subject">pollination</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="subject">style</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040723.140250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution Chemistry of some Dicarboxylate Salts of Relevance to the Bayer Process</field><field name="creator">A.Tromans@chem.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with certain aspects of the solution chemistry of the simple dicarboxylate anions: oxalate, malonate and succinate, up to high concentrations. These ions are either significant impurities in the concentrated alkaline aluminate solutions used in the Bayer process for the purification of alumina, or are useful models for degraded organic matter in industrial Bayer liquors. Such impurities are known to have important effects on the operation of the Bayer process.

To develop a better understanding of the speciation of oxalate (the major organic impurity in Bayer liquors) in concentrated electrolyte solutions, the formation constant (Log&#163;]) of the extremely weak ion pair formed between sodium (Na+) and oxalate (Ox2&#131;{) ions was determined at 25 oC as a function if ionic strength in TMACl media by titration using a Na+ ion selective electrode. Attempts to measure this constant in CsCl media were unsuccessful probably because of competition for Ox2&#131;{ by Cs+.

Aqueous solutions of sodium malonate (Na2Mal) and sodium succinate (Na2Suc) were studied up to high (saturation) concentrations at 25 oC by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) over the approximate frequency range 0.1 &#132;T &#163;h/GHz &#132;T 89. To complement a previous study of Na2Ox, formation constants of the Na+-dicarboxylate ion pairs were determined and they were shown to be of the solvent-shared type. Both the Mal2&#131;{ and Suc2&#131;{ ions, in contrast to Ox2&#131;{, were also shown to possess large secondary hydration shells  

Apparent molal volumes (Vf) and heat capacities at constant pressure (Cpf) of aqueous solutions of Na2Ox, Na2Suc, Na2Mal and K2Ox were determined at 25 oC up to their saturation limits using vibrating tube densitometry and flow calorimetry. These data were fitted using a Pitzer model. The adherence of Vf and Cpf of various Na+ and K+ salts to Young&#161;&#166;s rule was examined up to high concentrations using the present and literature data. Young&#161;&#166;s rule was then used to estimate hypothetical values of Cpf and Vf for the sparingly soluble Na2Ox at high ionic strengths, which are required for the thermodynamic modelling of Bayer liquors. 

The solubility of Na2Ox in various concentrated electrolytes was measured, at temperatures from 25 oC to 70 oC in media both with (NaCl, NaClO4, NaOH) and without a common ion (KCl, CsCl, TMACl). The common ion effect was found to dominate the solubility of Na2Ox. The solubility of calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaOx&#132;&#170;H2O) was also determined. The solubilities of both Na2Ox and CaOx&#132;&#170;H2O in media without a common ion increased with increasing electrolyte concentration, except in TMACl media, where they decreased. 

The solubility of Na2Ox was modelled using a Pitzer model assuming the Pitzer parameters for Na2SO4 and minimising the free energy of the system.

Common helminth parasites detected in feral cats included Ancylostoma spp. (29.8%), Oncicola pomatostomi (25.6%), Spirometra erinaceieuropaei (14%), Taenia taeniaeformis (4.7%), Physaloptera praeputialis (3.7%) and Toxocara cati (2.6%). The most common protozoan parasites detected in feral cats were Isospora rivolta (16.9%) and I. felis (4.5%). The native mammals were predominately infected with unidentified nematodes of the order Strongylida (59.1%), with members of the orders Rhabditida, Spirurida and Oxyurida also common. Oxyuroid nematodes were most common in the rodents (47.9%) and western grey kangaroos (27.8%). Several species of Eimeria were detected in the marsupials whilst unidentified species of Entamoeba and coccidia were common in most of the native fauna.

Primers anchored in the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were used to develop a polymerase chain reaction-linked restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique to differentiate the species of Ancylostoma detected in feral cats. Amplification of the ITS+ region (ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S gene) followed by digestion with the endonuclease RsaI produced characteristic patterns for A. tubaeforme, A. ceylanicum and A. caninum, which were detected in 26.6%, 4.7% and 0% of feral cats respectively. Giardia was detected in a cat, dingo, quenda and two native rodents. Sequence analysis at the small subunit rDNA gene (SSU-rDNA) identified the cat and dingo as harbouring G.duodenalis infections belonging to the genetic assemblages A and D respectively.

Subsequent analysis of the SSU-rDNA and elongation factor 1 alpha (ef1&#225;) identified a novel species of Giardia occurring in the quenda. Attempts to genetically characterise the Giardia in the two native rodents were unsuccessful.

Serological detection of Toxoplasma gondii was compared to a one tube hemi-nested PCR protocol to evaluate its sensitivity. PCR was comparable to serology in detecting T. gondii infections, although PCR was a much more definitive and robust technique than serology for large numbers of samples. Amplification of T. gondii DNA detected infections in 4.9% of feral cats and 6.5% of native mammals. The distribution of T. gondii does not appear to be restricted by environmental factors, which implies that vertical transmission is important for the persistence of T. gondii infections in Western Australia.

These results demonstrate that cats carry a wide range of parasitic organisms, many of which may influence the survival and reproduction of native mammals. As such, the large-scale conservation and reintroduction of native fauna in Western Australia must not disregard the potential influence parasites can have on these populations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral cat</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">wildlife</field><field name="subject">toxoplasma gondii</field><field name="subject">Ancylostoma</field><field name="subject">Giardia</field><field name="subject">vertical transmission</field><field name="subject">PCR - RFLP</field><field name="subject">Hemi-nested PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040730.142034</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asylum</field><field name="creator">D.Whish-Wilson@gunada.curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">This work consists of a Creative Work, Exegesis and a Bibliography.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative work</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040730.143406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linked Social-Ecological Systems: A Case Study of The Resilience of The Western Australian Agricultural Region</field><field name="creator">Helenallison@ozemail.com.au</field><field name="description">In the Western Australian agricultural region, an area of approximately 14 million hectares (70,000 square miles), widespread areas of native vegetation have been cleared and replaced with annual cropping systems, predominantly wheat. Only1.3 million hectares (10%) of small and scattered native vegetation remnants remain. By 2000 16% of land in the region was at risk from soil salinity and was largely unproductive for commercial agriculture. A new hydrological equilibrium affecting 33% of the Western Australian agricultural region is predicted to be reached between 2050 and 2300. 

The starting premise of this dissertation is that normal disciplinary science was adopted as the dominant intellectual influence on natural resource management policy and thus natural resource degradation was treated as a problem for science, extracted from its social,  economic and historical contexts. The second premise of this dissertation is that natural resource problems are not isolated scientific or technical problems, and are exacerbated by human failure to predict the complex inter-relationships among the social, ecological and economic systems.

This dissertation initially provides an analytical narrative on the Western Australian agricultural region between 1889 and 2003 (114 years) with the main finding being that in the years pre-1970 a development-driven Western Australian Government was responsible for extensive land clearing for agriculture, often contrary to scientific advice. In the 1980s and 1990s the severity and extent of soil salinity and the prognosis of future negative trends in other natural resource indicators caused a rapid proliferation and evolution of Federal and State policies designed to &#145;solve the problem&#146;. Nonetheless many natural resource problems remain intractable. The second part of the dissertation investigates the epistemology of the normal science paradigm as it was applied to natural resource management problems in the 20th century as a potentially contributing cause.

The evolution of an alternative epistemology, post-normal science paradigm, is then examined for explicating our current understanding of &#145;reality&#146;. A research framework was constructed which defines the post-normal science paradigm; the systemic approach; the bodies of theory&#150;organisational, ecology, resilience and system dynamics theory; the social-ecological system perspective; and the methods&#150;resilience analysis and system dynamics. This framework provides a novel way in which to gain a greater understanding of the fundamental or root causes of natural resource management problems. Using the case study of the Western Australian agricultural region a dynamic model was constructed based on descriptive information. An examination of the historical events and processes of the Western Australian agricultural region reveals that over a 114-year history it has evolved through two interactions of the adaptive cycle. Further investigation reveals these two cycles were synchronous with the second and third economic long-wave cycles or Kondratiev Cycles, that show the behaviour over time of the evolution of modern industrial societies. The model suggests that the reasons for the dynamic behaviour of the Western Australian agricultural region lie in the interaction of the three production growth drivers of the international commodity system, which have resulted in a pathological system, the &#145;Lock-in Trap&#146;. Increased total commodity production, reinvestment and declining prices in real terms have tended to produce the unintended negative impacts of resource decline, environmental pollution and rural population decline. I suggest that the expansion of thresholds through the reinvestment in technology is a principle reason why there has not yet been a profound collapse of exploited renewable resources in the Western Australian agricultural region. Regional natural resource management strategies will need to take account of not only spatial cross-scale issues, in particular the linkages between the individual farmer and the international commodity system, but also the temporal variables, in particular the slowly emerging changes in ecological/physical variables, such as the hydrological cycle. 

This research can help to provide the information and heuristic metaphors to encourage natural resource policy makers to take long-term and whole system perspectives. It includes a powerful set of tools for communicating dynamic processes in an integrated method to inform policy and management decisions. The ideas in this interdisciplinary research are essential for making science relevant within a social and ecological context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex adaptive systems</field><field name="subject">philosophy of science western australia agriculture</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">adaptive cycle.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040730.144640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School-As-Community: Bridging the Gap to Sustainability</field><field name="creator">S.Wooltorton@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">In this research I explore ways in which teachers and parents can enhance the sustainability agenda to bridge the gap towards sustainability through the creation of caring, democratic, just, ecologically regenerative schools-as-communities. I learned that we can only transform ourselves and not others, therefore to transform the model of experience of schooling and society, we need to transform ourselves, the whole community of the school, towards sustainability. This follows the work of Sterling (2001, 2002a and 2002b) which illustrates that education and society will need to change together in a mutually affirming way, since there is no linear cause-effect relationship.

This dissertation focuses on one aspect of the developing field of education for sustainability (EfS). I use radical ecology as the philosophy which supports the vision of community transformation towards sustainability (Orr 2002; Fien 2001; and Sterling 2001). I use the emancipatory research paradigm and detail a participatory epistemology fused with a holistic, constructivist notion of reality, to situate a participative approach which enables important interdisciplinary connections to be made. The research comprises ethnographic research and cooperative inquiry projects that were implemented at two small community schools, as well as reflective practice to develop personal and professional practices of sustainability. Contemporary work in the field of EfS has a cultural understanding of sustainability, which uses four pillars: the biophysical, the social-cultural, the economic and the political. The political pillar is the key organising principle for this research.

The research is significant because I develop and build upon Sterling&#146;s (2001) notion of transformative learning for sustainability. I show that participatory structures, procedures and processes are necessary, but not sufficient for a socially transformative school-as-community culture and that socio-ecologically contextualised knowing is transformative knowledge about community sustainability. For people to behave in cooperative ways, they need to develop a practical, reconnective knowledge of cooperation. Likewise, for people to behave in ecologically regenerative ways, they need to develop a practical, reconnective knowledge of ecological reconnection. The research methods of reflective practice and cooperative inquiry are discussed and evaluated as vehicles for transformation towards sustainability. The dissertation thereby assesses their effectiveness in enabling the development of practical knowledge about sustainability. 

In Australia, over the last decade our federal government has shown little interest in fulfilling its own narrowly defined ecological sustainability policy commitments. In Western Australia, our government has recently launched a comprehensive State Sustainability Strategy however its major weakness is that it has afforded very low significance to education at a time when major international organisations such as UNESCO (2002b) see education as an integral part of sustainability and learning as a key to a sustainable future. Sadly, the State Sustainability Strategy does not recommend a reorientation of the education system towards sustainability, does not incorporate a socially critical view of education, and almost completely overlooks the role of learning in the social task of change towards sustainability. In Western Australia, we urgently need policies and political action for commitment through structural reorientation towards EfS. Even in the face of this, a multi-perspectival, inclusive approach to the development of civil society through devolved, locally-based decision making and action within a school community can facilitate the emergence of learning for sustainability in that community. Even within a context of contradiction, tension and paradox, it is possible for school communities to contribute to sustainability through reconnective transformative learning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education for Sustainability</field><field name="subject">School Community Transformation</field><field name="subject">Environmental Education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040803.113536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Taxonomy, Phylogeny and Impact of Mycosphaerella Species on Eucalypts in South-Western Australia</field><field name="creator">aaron.maxwell@csiro.au</field><field name="description">Plantation eucalypts are a recent and rapidly growing industry in Australia, and will eventually replace the logging of old-growth forests. Over 40% of these plantations have been established in south-western Australia, where more than 160 000 ha of Eucalyptus globulus plantations now occur. In the early 1900&#146;s, this species was widely planted as an exotic in South Africa, but succumbed to severe pest (Gonipterus sp.) and disease (Mycosphaerella sp.) problems. Similarly, in south-western Australia E. globulus is an exotic species, but with the additional threat that it is planted adjacent to indigenous eucalypts, which increases the possibility of pests and pathogens switching between closely related eucalypt hosts. Over the past ten years, there have been anecdotal reports of increasing levels of Mycosphaerella leaf disease (MLD) in E. globulus plantations in south-western Australia. This increase in disease level is of concern to the industry. To date there have been no comprehensive studies into the taxonomy, biogeography and population genetics of MLD in south-western Australia. This thesis investigated the impact of MLD in south-western Australia with a focus on its impact, taxonomy, biogeography and population genetics. It is the first study worldwide to quantify the relative impact of different Mycosphaerella species in a regional plantation estate. 

A survey of pest, disease and nutritional disorders (Chapter 2) found that MLD was the most severe and frequently occurring, single taxonomic health threat to 1 and 2-year-old E. globulus plantations in south-western Australia. For the first time, this survey identified and quantified the impact of pest and disease damage to E. globulus plantations in the region. There were differences in the disease levels between plantations and this was due to initial Mycosphaerella species composition and inoculum level, and local climatic conditions favourable for disease, rather than to the provenance planted or the nutritional status of the individual plantations.

The survey for Mycosphaerella pathogens of eucalypts (Chapter 3) identified two new species of Mycosphaerella (M. ambiphylla and M. aurantia) and extended the known geographic range of eight other species (M. cryptica, M. gregaria, M. lateralis, M. marksii, M. mexicana , M. nubilosa, M. parva and M. suberosa). Of these: M. lateralis and M. mexicana were new records for Australia; and M. gregaria, M. nubilosa and M. parva were new records for Western Australia. A new anamorph, Phaeophloeospora ambiphylla was described and linked to M. ambiphylla. The occurrence of these new species and disease records in south-western Australia is significant for the plantation-eucalypt industry worldwide. The finding of two new species highlighted the need to quantify the disease impact of these on eucalypt plantations; and the extension of the range the remaining species raised important quarantine issues, concerned with the movement of plant material between regions and countries. 

The biogeographical investigation of Mycosphaerella (Chapter 4) identified that the most widespread and serious cause of MLD in south-western Australia is M. cryptica. In addition to occurring on the exotic E. globulus, it also occurs on two of the three important indigenous forestry eucalyptus species in this region. That is, on E. diversicolor, and E. marginata, but not on Corymbia calophylla. In terms of the plantation estate of E. globulus, however, M. nubilosa is the most widespread pathogen. The current study found that MLD on E. globulus is a complex of several different species, whereas, on E. diversicolor and E. marginata it is caused by only M. cryptica. Two species, M. cryptica and M. marksii were found commonly on adult E. globulus leaves. Although M. cryptica was the most frequent and serious cause of disease on adult leaves, M. marksii levels appear to be increasing and the future epidemiology of this pathogen should be closely monitored. There is some concern that these two MLD species could become an economically important problem on adult leaves of E. globulus. At present severe levels of MLD is significantly more common on juvenile than on adult foliage. 

The phylogenetic analysis (Chapter 5), based on ITS rDNA sequences from the present study and those obtained from GenBank accessions, found that Mycosphaerella is an assemblage of largely polyphyletic anamorph genera. Ten distinct clades emerged from the analysis. With the exception of the Dissoconium and the M. recutita clade, which comprised of two and one species respectively, none were comprised entirely of one anamorph genus alone. The anamorph genera represented were often dispersed across more than one clade, indicating that these anamorphs have arisen separately in different phylogenetic lineages. Cercospora, Stenella and Uwebraunia anamorphs each occurred in more than one separate clade. Although on the basis of rDNA sequence data Mycosphaerella appeared mostly monophyletic there was some evidence that the Mycosphaerella genus may be polyphyletic. This was particularly evident from the Dissoconium clade which grouped as closely to the outgroup Botryosphaeria taxon as it did with the remaining Mycosphaerella species. It was argued that a multi-gene phylogeny, which includes sequencing many species in other genera aligned with Mycosphaerella, is required in order to satisfactorily answer the question of whether Mycosphaerella is truly monophyletic. 

The phylogenetic analysis also showed that the taxonomy of Mycosphaerella based on ITS sequence data needs further clarification. Some species that are morphologically distinct, such as M. vespa and M. molleriana, shared identical ITS sequences. Other morphologically distinct species differed by as little as one or two nucleotides. Yet in other cases, the sequence variation amongst isolates from the same species differed substantially. Much of this variation in M. cryptica and other species was attributed to poorly edited sequences that had been lodged with GenBank. It was postulated that although a part of the remaining variation reflected the existence of cryptic species, some was likely to be genuine intra-species differences. It was concluded that further genes need to be sequenced, and more standardised cultural studies conducted in order to define species boundaries within Mycosphaerella.

Based on the ITS rDNA sequence data, two different molecular methods for the identification of Mycosphaerella species from eucalypts were developed (Chapter 6). The first of these was a PCR-RFLP method that enabled the identification of Mycosphaerella species present on eucalypts in south-western Australia. A key is provided, which enabled the identification of species on a combination of PCR-RFLP DNA fragment migration patterns and a small number of morphological features. This key enables the identification of Mycosphaerella species more easily than keys that rely on morphological features alone. Therefore, this has made it easier for non-Mycosphaerella specialists to identify species from this genus. The second molecular method developed for the identification of Mycosphaerella species was that of primers that selectively amplify the DNA of M. cryptica and M. nubilosa, the two most important causes of MLD (Chapter 6). This will allow the rapid identification of these two species by non-specialists in Mycosphaerella taxonomy. The primers from the current study will also enable early diagnosis of the possible causal organism of MLD in a plantation. Once the use of these primers for amplifying DNA from leaf tissue has been optimised, they will also facilitate studies into the early infection process of M cryptica and M. nubilosa. For example, the presence of the pathogen may be detected prior to the appearance of symptoms. Studies may be conducted to determine the length of a hemi-biotrophic phase, and the extent of tissue colonisation both spatially and temporally, beyond the necrotic lesion in these two Mycosphaerella species. Previously, such studies have been hampered by the slow growth rate of these fungi in culture and the lack of media that would allow their selective isolation and detection by directly plating diseased and non-diseased host tissue. 

This study has clearly indicated that Mycosphaerella species are the major disease threat to E. globulus plantations in Western Australia. It has also shown that over the relatively short period of time of less than ten years the number of species recorded has increased from three to ten, and that disease severity has increased in plantations. It is therefore critical to continue the research on this genus in order to understand the biology, epidemiology and population genetics of this pathogen. This is necessary in order to inform tree selection and silvicultural practise that will minimise the future impact of MLD. This is particularly important if the industry moves towards clonal and hybrid forestry as has occurred elsewhere in the world. This study has laid the foundations for future research on this disease through the elucidation of the taxonomy of Mycosphaerella in south-western Australia and by providing some important molecular tools for its diagnosis and further study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plantation eucalypts</field><field name="subject">Mycosphaerella leaf disease</field><field name="subject">Mycosphaerella</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040803.144922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconciliation in the forest? : an exploration of the conflict over the logging of native forests in the south west of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">David John Worth</field><field name="description">Over the past 30 years in Western Australia (WA), there has been a heated debate about the future use of the remaining temperate old-growth forests of karri and jarrah in the south-west of the State.

Over the past 30 years in Western Australia (WA), there has been a heated debate about the future use of the remaining temperate old-growth forests of karri and jarrah in the south-west of the State. This debate revolved around policy proposals from two social movements: one social movement wanted to preserve as much of the remaining old-growth forests as possible, and an opposing social movement supported a continued &#145;sustainable&#146; logging of the forests for hardwood products. This research project undertook a comparative case study
analysis of one WA organisation from each of these two social movements- Timber Communities Australia (TCA) on the pro-logging side and Liberals For Forests (LFF) on the anti-logging side. It drew on a macro-level European theoretical approach (New Social Movement theory) and a US organizational approach (Resource Mobilisation Theory). The study also investigated the extent to which these two social movement organisations (SMOs) had been effective in influencing the development of State forest policy. For this purpose Schumaker&#146;s (1975) framework for judging the political effectiveness of social movements was used. The key research problem investigated in this thesis is why these two SMOs continued to debate the forest policy issue after more than 30 years of public controversy?

Interviews with a key range of stakeholders were the key research method of this study. Additionally, an investigation into important economic and social changes in the south west was undertaken using census and other data between 1971 and 2001 and this was supported by an historical analysis of the timber industry in WA&#146;s south west. Finally, a 3-year study of the reporting of forest issues by two local and one national newspaper was completed. The 1998-2000 period was chosen for the newspaper analysis as this was when the new Regional Forest Agreement was being finalised.

This research shows that new values toward the old-growth forests developed among the WA public over the past 30 years and this has created an unbridgeable policy gap between those such as the TCA who wanted the past policies to continue and those such as the LFF who wanted to preserve the remaining native forests. ABS data confirm that the south-west region of WA changed dramatically between 1970 and 2000 as the wine and tourism industries developed and that these changes were different to those occurring in the other wine regions and non-city areas of Australia. As the population increased in this region, a key segment attracted by these new employment opportunities were middle class, well-educated people with new values toward the natural environment.

The interview and newspaper article data clearly showed that the debate in WA in the late 1990s over the proposed RFA provided a new political opportunity for the anti-logging movement to raise their concerns and to establish a renewed public debate about the appropriateness of the WA forest policies. This came at a time when the traditional policy power of the timber industry stakeholders and the government department in charge of the forests (Conservation And Land Management) had been dramatically diminished. The combination of these factors led to the election of the new ALP government and the introduction of a new, non-logging policy for WA&#146;s old-growth native forests.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Logging</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Native Forrests</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040804.161830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of an Integrated Process Operation Management System</field><field name="creator">ypower@bigpond.com.au</field><field name="description">This project details the development of a new framework known as the Coordinated Knowledge Management method to enable complete task integration of all low and midlevel tasks for process industries. The framework overcomes past problems of task integration, which made it impossible to have a fully integrated system and with integration being limited to data acquisition, regulatory control and occasionally supervisory control.

The main component of the project includes the use of hierarchically structured timed place Petri nets, which have not previously been used for integrating tasks in intelligent process operations management. Tasks which have been integrated include all low-level tasks such as data acquisition, regulatory control and data reconciliation, and all mid-level tasks including supervisory control and most significantly the integration of process monitoring  fault detection and diagnosis.

The Coordinated Knowledge Management method makes use of hierarchical timed place Petri nets to (i) coordinate tasks, (ii) monitor the system, (iii) activate tasks, (iv) send requests for data updates and (iv) receive notice when tasks are complete. Visualization of the state of the system is achieved through the moving tokens in the Petri net. The integration Petri nets are generic enough to be applied to any plant for integration using existing modules thus allowing the integration of different tasks, which use different problem solving methodologies.

Integrating tasks into an intelligent architecture has been difficult to achieve in the past since the developed framework must be able to take into account information flow and timing in a continuously changing environment. In this thesis Petri nets have been applied to continuous process operations rather than to batch processes as in the past. In a continuous process, raw materials are fed and products are delivered continuously at known flow-rates and the plant is generally operated at steady state (Gu and Bahri, 2002).

However, even in a continuous process, data is received from the distributed control system (DCS) at discrete time intervals. By transforming this data into process events, a Petri net can be used for overseeing process operations. The use of hierarchical Petri nets as the coordination mechanism introduces inherent hierarchy without the rigidity of previous methods. Petri nets are used to model the conditions and events occurring within the system and modules. This enables the development of a self-monitoring system, which takes into account information flow and timing in a continuously changing environment. Another major obstacle to integration of tasks in the past has been the presence of faults in the process. The project included the integration of fault detection and diagnosis a component not integrated into current systems but which is necessary to prevent abnormal plant operation. A novel two-step supervisory fault detection and diagnosis framework was developed and tested for the detection and diagnosis of faults in large-scale systems, using condition-event nets for fault detection and Radial Basis Function neural networks for fault diagnosis. This fault detection and diagnosis methodology detects and diagnoses faults in the early stages of fault occurrence, before fault symptoms propagate throughout the plant.

The Coordinated Knowledge Management method and the newly developed fault diagnosis module were developed in G21 and applied and tested on the Separation and Heating sections of the Pilot plant for the Bayer process at the School of Engineering Science, Murdoch University. Testing indicated that the use of an intelligent system comprising of Petri nets for integration of tasks results in improved plant performance and makes the plant easier to monitor increasing profits. The fault detection and diagnosis module was found to be useful in detecting faults very early on and diagnosing the exact location of faults, which would otherwise prove to be difficult to detect. This would also increase plant safety, reduce wastage and improve environmental considerations of the plant.

At a sub-national level these combine with local trends and issues to create unique regional milieu through which an integrated approach to sustainability may be negotiated. A change in government process may be required for sustainability to be implemented, and sub-national governance mechanisms are increasingly seen as important in enacting sustainability on the ground. Yet in Western Australia, large land mass and low population density means that neither State nor Local Governments are well equipped for this task. Western Australian regional policy and governance structures, as well as Commonwealth economic and regional policy trends, are important influences on regional sustainability. Both the Draft Western Australian State Sustainability Strategy and the Draft Statement of Regional Policy for Western Australia support a regional approach to sustainability planning. Yet models of regional governance organisation for the implementation of regional sustainability in Western Australia, such as regional associations of Local Governments, and Regional Development Commissions need to be further developed. It is at this regional level where partnerships between community, government and business may emerge to enact regionally appropriate initiatives for sustainability. For this to occur, community participation and government process that enables community participation to influence decision making is necessary. Regional approaches to natural resource management provide insight into the way that a regional approach to sustainability planning and organisation may evolve. Trends that influence regional issues and Commonwealth and Western Australian regional policy and structures provide a broad context for the development of regional sustainability strategies. Analysis of these issues and of the insights that may be gained from ideals for enabling governance mechanisms and regional natural resource management projects to facilitate regional sustainability are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Regional Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040811.143311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">S-wave model in electron-atom collisions</field><field name="creator">cplottke@fizzy.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the theory and presents the numerical solution of the S-wave models of electron-hydrogen and electron-helium scattering.

This thesis deals with the potential role of equine herpes virus types 1, 2, 4 and 5 in upper respiratory disease and poor performance in horses in Western Australia.

The methodology selected for the identification of equine herpes viruses in tissues of horses was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and therefore individual PCR assays were developed for the detection of each herpes virus, and then a nested multiplex PCR was developed to detect all four viruses. There was good correlation between the multiplex PCR for the detection of EHV and the detection of virus by isolation in cell culture, although a combination of the 2 techniques provided greater sensitivity than either technique alone. The multiplex PCR described appeared equally sensitive as specific PCR assays using a single set of primers for each individual virus but reduced labour and reagent costs.

As latency is a well recognised phenomenon in the equine herpes viruses and the horse is subjected to a number of stresses which might induce reactivation of latent infections, it was hypothesised that there would be a background level of replication of the equine herpes viruses in clinically normal horses. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were obtained from 282 clinical normal horses and examined for EHV. The results clearly demonstrated the widespread occurrence of EHV in the clinically healthy horses. The rate of detection of different types of EHV varied, as did the prevalence in young and adult horses. The most common EHV detected was EHV5: in 83.2% of 131 of horses &lt;2 years of age; in 40% of horses &gt;2 years of age.

A prospective clinical study was conducted whereby respiratory tract samples and PBL from adult horses with respiratory disease and/or poor performance were examined for equine herpes viruses; the aim was to determine a possible association between equine herpes virus infection and respiratory disease and/or poor performance. The relative incidence of factors identified in the history, signalment, physical and laboratory evaluation of horses in the study population was compared between horses from which EHV was identified in respiratory samples and horses negative for equine herpes virus. The results indicated that equine herpes viruses were important causes of respiratory disease in the study population, and that haematological and cytological data were a poor indicator of such equine herpes virus infection.

The occurrence of equine herpes virus in nasal swabs and PBL of weaned or unweaned foals from Thoroughbred breeding establishments was determined and provided data on the occurrence of EHV in association with respiratory disease. EHV5 was detected in nasal swabs and/or PBL at a high prevalence rate in healthy foals and yearling horses but its occurrence was not associated with clinical signs of respiratory disease. In contrast, EHV2 was detected more commonly in nasal swabs and/or PBL from foals with respiratory disease than in similar samples from healthy horses. Experimental infection of 8 horses with EHV2 was attempted and induced clinical signs of respiratory disease, but less severe than observed in the epidemiological studies. The results suggested that EHV2 is associated with mild upper respiratory tract infection in young horses.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herpes viruses</field><field name="subject">race horses</field><field name="subject">respiratory disease</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.112222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Systematic Controllability Assessment for Process Control Designs</field><field name="creator">Ewatigg@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Chemical process industries are constantly challenged to operate profitably and efficiently, despite the presence of significant uncertainties and disturbances on the operational conditions, and various operational limitations. The capability to meet the challenge relies on the quality of process control design, which should integrate the dynamic controllability characteristics in addition to the traditional economic considerations.

The focus of this thesis is the development of a systematic controllability assessment framework for process control design. The framework addresses the controllability aspects in process and controller structures, as well as in time-domain dynamic performances. The aim is to provide clearer relationships between process profitability, controllability, and operational switching strategies in response to variations in the operating conditions.

The skeleton of the framework is a mathematical optimisation algorithm. This algorithm considers the structural, operational and economic problems arising in process control design as a progressive, dynamic, and uncertain semi-infinite mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. The algorithm is an iterative, two-level optimisation, which determines the optimum process design and the associated controllability index within an optimisation window. The window progresses along a time horizon, ensuring optimal process design within the window while accommodating the design switching during the course of load variations in a larger time horizon.

The controllability index quantifies the design capability to satisfy a given economic objective. Unique to other existing approaches, the process controllability index is computed based on the multi-dimensional geometric representation of the disturbances and uncertainties, measured process dynamics, and feasible operating spaces. These representations account for variable interactions existing in a multivariable process operation, in contrast to separate quantification in traditional single variable assessments.

The geometric computation of the index requires the analysis and elimination of redundant measurement variables, which occur in different combinations at different process and controller structures. The redundancy is detected and eliminated based on statistical collinearity among the process data, allowing the assessment to focus on the retained functional variables and the associated critical disturbances and uncertainties.

The redundancy analysis is tailored with a dynamic mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver, which is dedicated to select the optimum process and controller structure within the design. The solver is developed based on the branch and bound strategy over the design tree, which consists of alternative nonlinear programming (NLP) sub-problems. In addition to the redundancy analysis, the solver is equipped with a compact MINLP formulation, an alternating depth-first and breadth-first search strategy,  sub-problems. The tailored strategy ensures fast and efficient convergence of convex problems, as well as superior optimum of non-convex counterparts.

Finally, the framework is performed within a time window, which progresses along the time horizon. This strategy provides realistic responses to major variations along greater length of time, by switching between optimum operational modes, while maintaining the optimum process controllability.

The performance of the framework is illustrated through several case studies. Each case demonstrates the novelty of addressing various computational features in a concise algorithm. These include the industrial case, which involves the systematic controllability assessment of an industrial five-effect liquor-burning evaporator within an Alumina refinery, which highlights the contribution of this framework in bridging the process design methodologies with the industrial implementation. The thesis consists of eight chapters, presenting the systematic development of the framework. The numerical implementations have been organised in a MATLAB Toolbox, accompanied with the relevant case studies.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process Control</field><field name="subject">Process design</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.113446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of White Dwarfs in the Solar Neighbourhood</field><field name="creator">kawka@maths.anu.edu.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to revisit the properties of white dwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood (distance &gt; 100 pc), in particular their magnetic fields, the occurrence of binarity and their space density. This thesis presents observations and analysis of a sample of white dwarfs from the southern hemisphere. Over 80 objects were observed spectroscopically, and 65 of these were also observed with a spectropolarimeter. Many of the white dwarfs observed belong to the Solar neighbourhood, and can be used to study the star formation and evolution in this region.

Our spectropolarimetric measurements helped constrain the fraction of magnetic white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood. Combining data from different surveys, I found a higher fraction of these objects in the relatively old local population than in other younger selections such as the Palomar-Green survey which suggests magnetic field evolution in white dwarfs, or different sets of progenitors. The progenitors of magnetic white dwarfs have been assumed to be Ap and Bp stars, however I find that the properties and number of Ap and Bp stars would only explain white dwarfs with magnetic fields larger than 100 MG. The number of known white dwarfs is believed to be complete to about 13 pc, however the sample is certainly incomplete to 20 pc from the Sun. To identify new white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood, some possibly magnetic or in binaries, numerous candidate white dwarfs from the Revised NLTT catalogue have been observed, which resulted in the discovery of 13 new white dwarfs, with 4 of these having a distance that places them within 20 pc of the Sun. The candidates were selected using a V &#8722; J reduced-proper-motion diagram and optical-infrared diagram. A total of 417 white dwarf candidates were selected, 200 of these have already been spectroscopically confirmed as white dwarfs.

Spectroscopic confirmation is required for the remaining 217 candidates, many of these are likely to belong to the Solar neighbourhood. Four close binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a cool companion were also observed, for which atmospheric and orbital parameters were obtained. The photometry for two of these binary systems, BPM 71214 and EC 13471-1258 shows that the secondary stars are filling their Roche lobes, and combined with their orbital parameters, these systems are very good candidates for hibernating novae. The time of their previous interaction or the extent of this interaction are unknown. The two other binary systems, BPM 6502 and EUVE J0720-31.7 are post-common envelope binaries. BPM 6502 is not expected to interact within a Hubble time, however EUVE J0720-31 is expected to become a cataclysmic variable within a Hubble time. The atmospheric parameters of the white dwarfs were determined using model atmosphere codes which were modified for the present study to include convective energy transfer, self-broadening and Lyman satellite features.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Dwarfs</field><field name="subject">Stars</field><field name="subject">Solar neighbourhood</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.115551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cleanup of the Buriganga River: Integrating the Environment into Decision Making</field><field name="creator">alam@usq.edu.au</field><field name="description">This research attempts to fill in some specific gaps in the area of economic valuation of non-market goods and services with respect to development projects, and the integration of those values in the policy decision-making process. The concept and theory of non-market valuation and project appraisal are examined. In a developing country context, the conventional contingent valuation method is extended to include respondents&#146; contribution in terms of time, irrespective of their decision to contribute money. This extension of the conventional contingent valuation method allows the inclusion of economic activities that are non-monetized and transactions in the form of &#145;barter exchange&#146;, which are typical for developing countries such as Bangladesh. The values generated by this new approach are integrated into an extended cost-benefit analysis, which reveals that the cleanup of dying rivers is not only an environmental imperative, but is also socially and economically justifiable. Apart from the theoretical investigation, another important dimension of this research is to contribute to the policy decision-making process with regard to public sector investment in developing countries.

The Buriganga River, which passes through Dhaka City, the capital of Bangladesh, has been selected as the case study for this research. Although considered to be the lifeline of the capital, the city part of the Buriganga River has become biologically and hydrologically dead because of the indiscriminate dumping of domestic and industrial wastes, encroachment by unscrupulous people, and negligence on the part of the authority to enforce rules and regulations pertaining to the ecological health of the river.

A cleanup programme has been designed for the Buriganga River to restore its water quality and develop new facilities in and around the river. This hypothetical cleanup programme is used: (i) to estimate the non-market benefits of an environmentally healthy waterway; (ii) to measure the total benefits; and (iii) to examine the desirability of public funding for the cleanup programme. An extended contingent valuation (ECV) survey of 400 households was carried out in Dhaka City in 2001. It reveals that not only are a significant proportion of the respondents willing to contribute direct cash for the environmental improvement of the river, they are also willing to contribute their time. When the contribution in terms of time is monetized, it is estimated to represent about 60 percent of the total contribution (the remaining 40 percent being cash payment).

The total non-market benefits from the Buriganga River cleanup programme are estimated at Tk 388 million (US$ 6.80 million) in the first year, rising to Tk 1805 million (US$ 31.66 million) by the 10th year of the programme. The public decision making process in Bangladesh does not consider such benefits. Failures to do so lead to gross under-estimation of the potential for, and contribution of, undertaking environmental improvement activities.

The total benefits of the cleanup programme are estimated within the framework of total economic value: the non-market benefits are estimated using the ECV survey inputs, and the market benefits are measured using secondary information, market methods and a benefit transfer approach. The cost estimate of the cleanup programme is made using market and secondary information with appropriate adjustments. The extended cost-benefit analysis (ECBA), which integrates the non-market benefits of the cleanup programme, shows that such public funding is worth undertaking. The study also reveals that a significant portion (68 percent) of this investable funding can be generated from the community.

The need for a cleanup programme of the Buriganga River is not an isolated case in Bangladesh. Many rivers in that country, and also throughout the developed and developing world are under threat of becoming biologically and hydrologically dead. This study provides a framework for addressing such environmental problems. It demonstrates that the ECV survey is a useful tool in estimating economic values of resources even in extremely poor economies. The modification of the contingent valuation method takes into account the local context, including cultural, economic, social and political settings. The extended cost-benefit analysis, which integrates better resource values could provide important information for the policy decision-making process. This is particularly useful for countries where the democratic system is not fully developed and there is limited experience in integrating the environment into the decision making.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buriganga River</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.120416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulp Literature: a Re-evalutation</field><field name="creator">David Ellis Morgan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation is to redress the literary academy&#146;s view of Pulp Literature as an inconsequential form, which does not merit serious contemplation, or artistic recognition. Although it is true that recent literary criticism has attempted to elevate the importance of Pulp by positing it as the natural postmodern &#147;other&#148; to &#145;high&#146; literature, the thesis demonstrates how this dichotomy has proven to be counter-productive to its aim. That is, although this theoretical approach does invite legitimate investigation of the form, many academics simply use this technique to reinforce their claims for the superiority of so-called &#145;canonic&#146; texts. Therefore, rather than continuing along this downward path, this thesis focuses more on the subversive machinations of Pulp Literature as a social, economic, political, and theoretical force with its own strategies and agendas, opening with an investigation of the history of Pulp Literature as a cultural form. 

I argue that, from its very conception with the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, Pulp has always offered a radical alternative to the mainstream by providing a voice for the marginalised and the oppressed in the societies of the world. The thesis traces this political role as the aesthetic evolves into the new forms and technologies of a contemporary culture, where many academics still refuse to acknowledge Pulp as an important agent for the transmission of ideological views, and an impetus to instigate social change. The concluding arguments move away from the quantitative, to the more theoretically evaluative section of the thesis. This consists of a discussion of the conceptual boundaries surrounding the aesthetic of Pulp, broaching such subjects as literary evaluation, canonicity, and canon formation. This debate ultimately revolves around the question, &#145;if literary theorists cannot &#145;objectively&#146; determine what literary &#145;quality&#146; is, then how can we hope to define Pulp?&#146;

In an attempt to answer this question, the thesis juxtaposes the criteria of a number of literary theorists from this field of inquiry, namely, Thomas R. Whissen, Clive Bloom, Thomas J. Roberts, Harold Bloom, Andrew Calcutt and Richard Shephard, to formulate an aesthetic that is not only markedly different to their&#146;s, but more significantly, one which situates Pulp Literature at the head of the literary academic table.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulp Literature</field><field name="subject">postmodern literature</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.122551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syntheses of the Enantiopure Quinones A and A' and Their C-1 Epimers.</field><field name="creator">Francois Jacobus Oosthuizen</field><field name="description">The 3,4-dihydro-1H-naphtho[2,3-c]pyran ring system is found in many natural products as the 5,10- or 6,9-quinones. These compounds have been synthesized by various research groups as a result of their wide range of biological activities. This thesis describes several investigations directed towards syntheses of compounds in this general area. Quinone A (16) and quinone A&#146;(17), derived from the naturally occurring aphid insect pigments protoaphin-fb and protoaphin-sl respectively, were of particular interest.

The first chapter describes the previous syntheses of some naphtho[c]pyrans including those relating to the aphid pigment derivatives, followed by the isolation and identification of the aphid pigments. Also described was the ability of these naphthopyranquinones to act as potential bioreductive alkylating or dealkylating agents. The latter part of the chapter deals with the syntheses of the racemates of the aphid pigment derivatives quinones A and A&#146; &#140; and deoxyquinone as well as model studies toward the non-quinonoid cleavage product, glucoside B. The chapter concludes with the progress made towards the first asymmetric synthesis of these compounds.

Chapter 2 reports the establishment of conditions which led to ortho or para regioselectivity in the intramolecular cyclisation of tethered lactaldehydes to form benzo[c]pyrans. This regioselectivity depended on whether either benzyl or tbutyldimethylsilyl was used as protecting group. This chapter also described a model for the control of stereochemistry leading to quinone A&#146;.

Chapter 3 describes the syntheses of naphthalenes as potential precursors to the naphthopyranquinones derived from the aphid insect pigments. This followed after problems were encountered in previous work with inappropriate protection in the oxidation of halogenated benzopyrans.

Chapter 4 develops the first successful syntheses of enantiopure quinone A and quinine A&#146; with the correct absolute stereochemistry. This involved the regioselective addition of 1,3-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-1-methoxybuta-1,3-diene toselectively halogenated benzopyranquinones. The latter were obtained through complementary series of highly diastereoselective transformations based on 2,5- dihydroxyacetophenone as starting material and (R)-lactate from the chiral pool as the source of asymmetry.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quinones</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.123649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Swings and Round-abouts: Discourses of Connectedness in Secondary Schools</field><field name="creator">romp11@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Connectedness is a complex idea that seems to mean different things for each individual. For the purposes of this dissertation, connectedness can best be understood as the ways that an individual feels an affiliation with the community of the institution that he/she experiences. This dissertation seeks to uncover the discourses that various stakeholder groups have within the site of a single school concerning connectedness.

One of the precepts that this dissertation holds is that connectedness to school has benefits for the individual as learner, the school as a community and potentially the wider community in years to come. This is a theoretical position in the lineage of such theorists as Plato, Rousseau, and Dewey who have argued that education is a transformative practice that could be a tool in solving some of the issues that contemporary societies face.

To examine the issue of connectedness, focus group research was chosen as the most beneficial methodology, as it allowed the stakeholders to explore their understanding of connectedness in small groups of their peers. It was important that the students in particular were allowed to develop their discourses of connectedness, as they were at the centre of the converging and diverging discourses. For this reason there were four student focus groups. The students selected for each of the student focus groups were targeted because of particular characteristics. They were purposively sampled to examine how, if at all, these discourses changed if the student was a high achiever, a quiet student, a student committed to the co-curricular programme of the school or a student who had been in regular trouble with the school hierarchy. There were also two parent focus groups, two staff focus groups, and a focus group made up of members of the school council.

The contributions of the various focus groups were analysed in the light of the work done by the French theorist Michel Foucault concerning the institution and the way that it deploys discursive practices to govern and regulate the subject. A number of his ideas that have been particularly important in this work. Foucault&#146;s power, discourse and governmentality have informed the analysis of the data and have supported the conclusions drawn. The key finding of this dissertation is that discourses of connectedness are crucial in determining how students feel about their schools. Many of the stakeholder groups hold diverging expectations of what connectedness is. These findings, and others, have implications for the management of schools in Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary schools</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.124631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Modelling and Optimisation of Carbon Management Strategies in Gold Processing</field><field name="creator">sawan.jonguwa@au.experian.com</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development and application of a dynamic model of gold adsorption onto activated carbon in gold processing. The primary aim of the model is to investigate different carbon management strategies of the Carbon in Pulp (CIP) process. This model is based on simple film-diffusion mass transfer and the Freundlich isotherm to describe the equilibrium between the gold in solution and gold adsorbed onto carbon. A major limitation in the development of a dynamic model is the availability of accurate plant data that tracks the dynamic behaviour of the plant. This limitation is overcome by using a pilot scale CIP gold processing plant to obtain such data. All operating parameters of this pilot plant can be manipulated and controlled to a greater degree than that of a full scale plant. This enables a greater amount of operating data to be obtained and utilised.

Two independent experiments were performed to build the model. A series of equilibrium tests were performed to obtain parameter values for the Freundlich isotherm, and results from an experimental run of the CIP pilot plant were used to obtain other model parameter values. The model was then verified via another independent experiment. The results show that for a given set of operating conditions, the simulated predictions were in good agreement with the CIP pilot plant experimental data.

The model was then used to optimise the operations of the pilot plant. The evaluation of the plant optimisation simulations was based on an objective function developed to quantitatively compare different simulated conditions. This objective function was derived from the revenue and costs of the CIP plant. The objective function costings developed for this work were compared with published data and were found to be within the published range. This objective function can be used to evaluate the performance of any CIP plant from a small scale laboratory plant to a full scale gold plant. The model, along with its objective function, was used to investigate different carbon management strategies and to determine the most cost effective approach. A total of 17 different carbon management strategies were investigated. An additional two experimental runs were performed on the CIP pilot plant to verify the simulation model and objective function developed.

Finally an application of the simulation model is discussed. The model was used to generate plant data to develop an operational classification model of the CIP process using machine learning algorithms. This application can then be used as part of an online diagnosis tool.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold processing</field><field name="subject">Carbon management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.131520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing Anaerobic Degradation of Lipids in Wastewater by Addition of Co-substrate</field><field name="creator">y.kuang@exchange.curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">Anaerobic treatment systems are becoming increasingly popular to treat complex organic wastes that contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Lipids are widely found in sewage and industrial wastewaters. Dairy, edible oil, fat refining, slaughterhouse, wool scouring, meat processing plants and grease-trap wastes from restaurants generate wastewater high in lipids. Although it is well known that lipids can be degraded by biological process, they have been reported to inhibit anaerobic processes by causing sludge flotation and wash-out. The inhibitory effect of lipids in anaerobic process has also been attributed to the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) which are the hydrolysed products of lipids. It has been shown that LCFA and lipids inhibit the formation of granular sludge in Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors and that the adsorption of LCFAs on to the granules can result in its flotation and washout. It was also found that the degradation of LCFA was very poor.

Various techniques have been employed to enhance degradation of lipids and these include physico-chemical pre-treatment, application of two stage treatment employing new reactor designs like Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB). This thesis investigated the influence of co-substrates, both in the form of hydrolysed products and polymeric form, on reducing the toxicity and enhancing the degradation of LCFA and lipids in a single stage and two stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. The investigations were carried out on both microbiological and physico-chemical aspects. A combination of techniques including the use of light microscopy (LM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), transmission electron microscopy (SEM) and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) was used to study the characteristics of microbial aggregates and to locate microbial populations within these aggregates. The microbial populations visualised using FISH techniques were Bacteria, Archaea, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosarcinaceae. The performance of digesters was also monitored by measuring bulk parameters such as concentration of residual substrates, intermediate products (LCFAs, volatile fatty acids), methane (or gas) production rate and chemical oxygen demand of treated effluent.

Initially batch assays were carried out to determine the effects of glucose (hydrolysis product of carbohydrate) and cysteine (hydrolysis product of protein) on the toxicity of sodium oleate (hydrolysis product of lipid) to methanogenesis. The results showed that glucose and cysteine addition could reduce the toxicity of sodium oleate on the methanogenesis and enhance the degradation of sodium oleate. While the addition of glucose had a better effect than cysteine on decreasing the toxicity of sodium oleate, the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal result to stimulate the degradation of sodium oleate.

Secondly the effect of addition of glucose, cysteine and sodium oleate as co-substrates on the characteristics of granules in an LCFA fed single stage UASB were investigated. It was shown that the addition of glucose produced the best results on the formation of granules while both cysteine and sodium oleate adversely affected the granule formation. In a LCFA inhibited digester glucose and cysteine addition enhanced the recoveries of different anaerobic microbial communities. Although the effects of glucose and cysteine on the various microbial groups were different, the combination of glucose and cysteine had the optimal results on recoveries of all bacterial groups.

The next half of the thesis investigated the influence of starch and yeast extract on the hydrolysis and degradation of canola oil by application of one and two stage UASB reactors. The results showed that the combined addition of protein and carbohydrate had an optimal effect on enhancing the hydrolysis of lipid compared to the addition of only protein or carbohydrate by promoting a balanced growth of the microbial groups. It was also demonstrated that a two- stage UASB reactor performed better in terms of extent of lipid hydrolysis and methanogenesis than a one-stage UASB reactor.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipids</field><field name="subject">Wastewater</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.132229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water stress and disease development in Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) infected with Phytophthora cinnamomi.</field><field name="creator">Anne Lucas</field><field name="description">The south-west of Western Australia has a Mediterranean climate and flora endemic to this area, including the keystone species, jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), have adapted to the droughted summer conditions. The introduction of an exotic soil borne pathogen, Phytophthora cinnamomi, has challenged the survival of this and many other species. The expectation might be that plants stressed by drought are more susceptible to disease and this study examined the development of disease caused by P. cinnamomi in E. marginata and the significance of water status to that development.

Seedlings of E. marginata, clonal plants resistant to P. cinnamomi and clonal plants susceptible to P. cinnamomi, were subjected to different watering regimes in a number of field and glasshouse experiments. To determine the level of drought stress that could be imposed on container-grown E. marginata seedlings without killing them, a preliminary experiment progressively lowered the moisture levels of the substrate in their containers, until the plants reached wilting point, at which time moisture was restored to a predetermined droughted level and the process repeated. With each subsequent droughting the wilting point was lower until it was found that the seedlings could survive when only 5% of the moisture lost from container capacity to wilting point was restored. 

No deaths had occurred after seedlings had been maintained at this low level for 14 days (Chapter 2). Based on these findings, the level of droughting maintained in all experiments conducted under controlled glasshouse conditions was 10% restoration. After testing the appropriateness of underbark inoculation, and a zoospore inoculation method for which no wounding was necessary, a new, non-invasive stem inoculation technique was developed. Stems were moistened in a pre-treatment, then agar plugs colonized with P. cinnamomi mycelium were held against the stem with wads of wet cotton wool and bound in place with tape. This technique resulted in a high proportion of infection in E. marginata (Chapter 4) without the need for underbark inoculation or the use of zoospores (Chapter 3). It was successfully used in a large field trial in a rehabilitated bauxite mine site with 2-year-old E. marginata clonal plants, resistant to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 5). Inoculation was in late spring after the winter and spring rainfall.  This timing was to allow comparison of disease development in stressed plants under normal droughted summer conditions compared with itsdevelopment in non-stressed, irrigated plants. However, two months after inoculation, the area was deluged with unseasonal and abnormally heavy summer rainfall, negating any difference in the treatments and causing an outbreak of P. cinnamomi in the soil from an adjacent infested site. This resulted in the infection and death of some noninoculated control clones. 

Monitoring of the site continued for twelve months and the advance of P. cinnamomi at the site was mapped. To test the effect of drought on the expression of P. cinnamomi under more controlled conditions, a series of glasshouse experiments was set up that simulated two possible summer conditions; drought or drought followed by abnormally high summer rainfall. These experiments utilised E. marginata seedlings and clonal plants, some resistant and some susceptible to P. cinnamomi. Plants were inoculated with P. cinnamomi prior to or after droughting. Results were compared to those of control plants that had not experienced water deficit. In both seedlings and clonal plants, the greatest extent of colonization was found in plants which had experienced no water deficit. These results indicated that drought stress played a role in inhibiting the in planta development of P. cinnamomi in all genotypes (Chapter 8). This finding was consistent for both clones, susceptible and resistant to P. cinnamomi. Most recoveries were made from non-stressed clonal plants, resistant to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 6) and more colonization was found in non-stressed clonal plants, susceptible to P. cinnamomi (Chapter 7), than was recorded for droughted plants.

The results of the field trial showed that P. cinnamomi was not recovered from some inoculated stems, which had obvious lesions, when segments were plated onto selective agar. This led to an intensive in vitro investigation into improved methods of recovery. Dark brown exudates from some segments of inoculated stems stained the surrounding agar onto which they were plated, suggesting the presence of phenolic compounds. Recovery of the pathogen from stems increased by about 10% when segments were first soaked in distilled water to leach out the phenolic compounds, then replated onto agar. Other recovery methods were also tested, including (1) baiting with Pimelea ferruginea leaves floated on the surface of water or soil filtrate, in which the infected stem segments were immersed and (2) the application of different light and temperature regimes. It was clearly shown that exudates from infected stems of field grown E. marginata inhibited the outgrowth of P. cinnamomi onto the agar. To counter the possible toxic effect that oxidized phenolics had on the growth of the P. cinnamomi, an antioxidant was added to the agar. P. cinnamomi was grown on media whichincorporated exudates from infected stems and different concentrations of ascorbic acid, with and without adjusted pH levels. There was a pronounced pH effect, with less growth on media with lower pH and no significant increase in growth of the mycelium with increased ascorbic acid concentration on pH adjusted agar (Chapter 9).

The inhibitory effect of the exudates from the stem segments led to an investigation of the possibility that, if seedlings to be planted in the rehabilitation process could be pre-treated with phenolic compounds to render them more resistant, they may have an advantage when establishing in areas where there was a potential threat of P. cinnamomi. E. marginata seeds were germinated and the seedlings grown hydroponically in a constant temperature growth room. Different concentrations of synthetic catechol, a phenolic compound naturally occurring in E. marginata, were added to the nutrient solution. Roots remained immersed in the catechol solutions for three days, before being inoculated at the root tip with zoospores of P. cinnamomi. Roots in higher concentrations of catechol were less colonized than those in lower concentrations, indicating an increased resistance to the pathogen (Chapter 10). Further work is required to determine if seedlings treated before being planted in areas threatened by an outbreak of P. cinnamomi have a greater capacity for survival, and for how long the protection persists. 

The improved recovery of P. cinnamomi from infected plants is important for accurate assessment of the spread of the disease in an area and for the subsequent implementation of management strategies of containment and control. An outbreak of P. cinnamomi can impact on the revegetation of rehabilitated mine sites and the aetiology of the pathogen in mine sites needs to be more fully understood. The interaction of plant defences with the invasive pathogen has been examined in a range of environments in the field, the glasshouse, in a hydroponics system and in vitro. The results indicate that summer droughting increases the resistance of E. marginata to P. cinnamomi. However, more work is required to understand the mechanisms involved. The study also indicates that clones of E. marginata, selected as resistant to P. cinnamomi, are not resistant under all conditions and that environmental interactions should be further investigated. Lastly, for effective management strategies to be implemented it is critical that the pathogen can be confidently isolated from plants. It was shown that exudates from infected hosts inhibit the recovery of P. cinnamomi. Recovery methods that can overcome these inhibitory compounds are required. The findings invite further research into the complexity of host-pathogen relationships.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus marginata</field><field name="subject">Jarrah</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.132907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the Antiprotozoal Activity of some Tubulin Inhibitors Following Cyclodextrin Complexation.</field><field name="creator">pmenon1@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of tubulin inhibitors when complexed with hydroxypropyl-&#226;-cyclodextrin (&#199;P&#226;CD) against a range of protozoan parasites. This approach involved investigations into the complexation of these drugs with &#199;P&#226;CD, and subsequent investigations of these drugs and their complexes in regard to cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, in vitro efficacy against Giardia, Cryptosporidium and rodent malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi), and their in vivo efficacy against Giardia and malaria.

Albendazole (ABZ) is a benzimidazole carbamate with a broad anti-parasite spectrum, while the dinitroanilines trifluralin (TF) and oryzalin (OZ) have recently been found to exhibit activity against certain parasites. All three compounds are microtubule antagonists in either nematodes or weeds and have poor aqueous solubility, with the solubility of ABZ and OZ dependent on pH. Cyclodextrins (CD) have a hydrophobic cavity that allows them to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic drugs, resulting in increased drug aqueous solubility, and often, improved drug dissolution and bioavailability. Thus the complexation of these drugs with &#199;P&#226;CD was investigated.

All three compounds exhibited type AL phase solubility diagrams with &#199;P&#226;CD complexation, with additional increases in ABZ and OZ solubility achieved through the manipulation of temperature and pH. OZ displayed a stronger interaction with &#199;P&#226;CD when ionised over its neutral form. However, insufficient concentrations of the TF/&#199;P&#226;CD complex were achieved for drug efficacy studies. The cytotoxicity of the drugs and their complexes was assessed using the assay kit Cytotox 96 with human carcinoma cells. This is a colourimetric assay that measures lactate dehydrogenase release as a consequence of compromised cellular and membrane integrity. Both ABZ and OZ are cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and differentiating cells but are not cytotoxic to cells in the stationary phase. Complexation did not affect drug cytotoxicity. 

In pharmacokinetic studies, complexation improved ABZ (and metabolites) bioavailability, but had no significant affect on OZ bioavailability. In vitro drug assessment studies found ABZ to be highly effective against Giardia, and effectiveagainst Cryptosporidium and malaria. OZ on the other hand exhibited no activity against Giardia, but was effective against Cryptosporidium and malaria. Complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal efficacy of either ABZ or OZ. In particular, excess &#199;P&#226;CD decreased the antigiardial effects of ABZ, possibly due to competitive complex formation. In addition, complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal effects of ABZ in vivo. 

However, the cytotoxic effect of the ABZ/&#199;P&#226;CD complex was more evident in the treatment of malaria in vivo, resulting in increased anaemia and suppression in weight gain, due to the improved bioavailability of ABZ and metabolites. &#199;P&#226;CD alone was found to be cytotoxic at greater than 2.5%, and inhibited Giardia both in vitro and in vivo at greater than 1% and 2% respectively. This was attributed to membrane disruption caused by the dissolution and removal of membrane components.

In comparison, malaria grew better in the presence of &#199;P&#226;CD in vitro, with no detrimental effect observed at up to 8% &#199;P&#226;CD. This was attributed to either the increased solubilization of a necessary media component, or the complexation and removal of an inhibitory compound from the cultivation medium. Therefore &#199;P&#226;CD complexation did not improve the antiprotozoal activity of the tubulin antagonists ABZ and OZ. However, the results of the pharmacokinetic studies suggest that anthelmintic activity of ABZ, particularly against systemic infections, may be improved with oral administration of the ABZ/&#199;P&#226;CD complex. In addition, the antiparasitic activity of &#199;P&#226;CD alone may be promising, especially against intestinal infections. Finally, the improved in vitro cultivation of P. chabaudi in the presence of &#199;P&#226;CD presents a promising approach to its potential long term cultivation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyclodextrin Complexation</field><field name="subject">Tubulin Inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Antiprotozoal Activity</field><field name="subject">protozoan parasites</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.133836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bitch: The Politics of Angry Women</field><field name="creator">kyliespear@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">&#145;Bitch: the Politics of Angry Women&#146; investigates the scholarly challenges and strengths in re theorising popular culture and feminism. It traces the connections and schisms between academic feminism and the feminism that punctuates popular culture. By tracing a series of specific bitch trajectories, this thesis accesses an archaeology of women&#146;s battle to gain power.

Feminism is a large and brawling paradigm that struggles to incorporate a diversity of feminist voices. This thesis joins the fight. It argues that feminism is partly constituted through popular cultural representations. The separation between the academy and popular culture is damaging theoretically and politically. Academic feminism needs to work with the popular, as opposed to undermining or dismissing its relevancy.

Cultural studies provides the tools necessary to interpret popular modes of feminism. It allows a consideration of the discourses of race, gender, age and class that plait their way through any construction of feminism. I do not present an easy identity politics. These bitches refuse simple narratives. The chapters clash and interrogate one another, allowing difference its own space.

I mine a series of sites for feminist meanings and potential, ranging across television, popular music, governmental politics, feminist books and journals, magazines and the popular press. The original contribution to knowledge that this thesis proffers is the refusal to demarcate between popular feminism and academic feminism. A new space is established in which to dialogue between the two.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">Cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.135459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of phosphite on disease development and histological responses in Eucalyptus marginata infected with Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">Ros Pilbeam</field><field name="description">Phosphite is currently used for the management of Phytophthora cinnamomi in native plant communities. A greater understanding of how phosphite affects the host-pathogen interaction is required in order to determine the most effective treatment. This thesis aimed to investigate the effects of applied phosphite concentration on phytotoxicity, in planta concentration of phosphite, disease development and anatomical responses of Eucalyptus marginata.

Spraying the foliage to run-off with 7.5 and 10 g phosphite/L led to the development of severe leaf necrosis within 7 days, with greater than 60% of the leaf area damaged. Moderate phytotoxicity was observed after treatment with 5 g phosphite/L. In planta concentration of phosphite in stems, lignotubers and roots did not differ significantly between applied concentrations of phosphite. 

Stem tissue contained the largest concentration of phosphite at one week after spraying, with approximately 210 and 420 &#181;g phosphite/g dry weight detected after treatment with 5 and 10 g phosphite/L, respectively. In a subsequent field trial, the applied concentration of phosphite was found to affect the duration of effectiveness of phosphite in protecting E. marginata seedlings from stem colonisation by P. cinnamomi. Plants were wound-inoculated with P. cinnamomi at 6-monthly intervals after spraying with phosphite. The 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L treatments were effective against colonisation by P. cinnamomi when inoculated 0 and 6 months after spraying, but only the 5 g phosphite/L treatment inhibited P. cinnamomi within 12 months of spraying. Phosphite had no effect on colonisation by P. cinnamomi when plants were inoculated at 17 months after spraying. The in planta concentration of phosphite detected in the leaves, stems and roots of plants treated with 5 g phosphite/L did not differ significantly between the time of harvest or tissue type at 0.2 and 6 months after spraying. P. cinnamomi remained viable in plants treated with phosphite.Treatment with 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L when P. cinnamomi was well established in the stems was ineffective at preventing the death of E. marginata.

Between 45 and 89% of plants were girdled on the day of spraying. Spraying plants with 2.5 and 5 g phosphite/L when conditions were less favourable for the pathogen reduced the mortality of E. marginata for up to 10 months.
E. marginata seedlings responded to damage by P. cinnamomi with the production of kino veins and woundwood. Bark lesions were in the process of being sloughed off by 7 months after inoculation in plants that remained alive. In plants of a resistant (RR) clonal line and susceptible (SS) clonal line, phosphite treatment inhibited lesion extension in stems, but lesions did not indicate the amount of stem colonised by P. cinnamomi. The pathogen was isolated from up to 17 cm beyond the lesion front in the RR clonal line. Treatments that reduced the mortality of E. marginata were 5 g phosphite/L in the RR clonal line (RR/5) and 10 g phosphite/L in the SS clonal line (SS/10).

Uninoculated plants were wounded with liquid nitrogen to determine the microscopic responses to injury in the absence of the pathogen. Wound closure was achieved within 21 days of wounding, with callus formation and vascular cambium regeneration. A wound periderm separated wounded tissue from healthy tissue, adjacent to a lignified boundary zone. Two types of phellem were observed &#150; thin-walled phellem (TnP) and thick-walled phellem (TkP). The first-formed TnP layers contained variable-shaped cells, while subsequent layers were more cubical in shape. Multiple TnP layers developed up to 42 days after wounding, with TkP cells sandwiched between the TnP layers. Genotype and phosphite treatment did not affect the wound responses.

Inoculated plants with a restricted lesion extension also formed a wound periderm to separate damaged tissue from healthy tissue. Phosphite treatment stimulated the responses to P. cinnamomi in both clonal lines. Early development of the wound periderm was visible by 6 days after phosphite treatment. It waspreceded by the formation of a ligno-suberised boundary zone in the cambial zone and in phloem parenchyma cells existing prior to injury. Suberin was not detected in the SS/0 treatment. TnP layers completely surrounded lesioned tissue in plants still alive by 24 days after phosphite treatment. Extensive callus production was evident in the SS/10, RR/5 and RR/10 treatments.

Temperature affected the post-inoculation efficacy of phosphite and anatomical responses of E. marginata. At 20&#176;C, lesion extension was restricted in both clonal lines of E. marginata, irrespective of phosphite treatment. Greater than 70% of inoculated plants in all treatments produced a ligno-suberised boundary zone at 20&#176;C and between 30 and 70% formed a wound periderm. At 28&#176;C, lesion extension was reduced in phosphite-treated plants at 7 days after treatment. However, lesions continued to extend up to 5 mm per day in the SS clonal line and very few SS plants formed a wound periderm at the lesion front. This contrasted with the strong responses to abiotic wounding observed in uninoculated SS plants at 28&#176;C. The most extensive responses to P. cinnamomi were detected in the RR/5 treatment at 28&#176;C, with a ligno-suberised boundary zone and differentiated TnP of a wound periderm observed in greater than 70% of plants. This treatment resulted in significantly less girdled plants than all other treatments at 28&#176;C, including the RR/0 treatment. At 23 and 24&#176;C, there was no significant difference in acropetal lesion extension or circumferential lesion spread between clonal lines. The inoculation technique and environmental conditions may have resulted in too high a disease pressure for a full expression of resistance in the RR clonal line.

This thesis demonstrates that phosphite has the potential to enhance the resistance of young E. marginata and enable them to survive infection by P. cinnamomi. However, its effectiveness is dependent upon a number of factors, including host resistance, environmental conditions, the applied phosphite concentration and the timing of application.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphite</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus marginata</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.140206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Enterprise Facilitation</field><field name="creator">Ernesto Sirolli</field><field name="description">In a rapidly globalizing economy, many communities are stranded in unemployment or work without meaning. This thesis asks the question: can local communities create economic development with fulfilling work? The experience of the author in African development projects is used to pose questions about modernist approaches to development. The alternative approaches to work and human development by Fritz Schumacher, Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers are melded with the political insight of Robert Putnam, to suggest that the answer to the above question can be positive. Their theories are distilled into an approach called Local Enterprise Facilitation, which is based on four principles:
1. Only work with individuals or communities that invite you.
2. Do not motivate individuals to do anything they do not wish to do.
3. Trust that they are naturally drawn towards self-improvement.
4. Have faith in community and the higher social needs that bond it together.

The author&#146;s experience of twenty years in applying and developing this approach is traced from its origins in rural Western Australia, through other parts of Australia and New Zealand to its extensive application in North America. The experience has created a methodology for successful Local Enterprise Facilitation based around a community Board that can provide the necessary support for networks for new enterprises. In particular the methodology uses a &#147;Trinity of Management&#148; approach whereby the separate skills of production/enterprise, financial accounting and marketing are facilitated as no individual can do more than one of these skills successfully.

The Local Enterprise Facilitation philosophy has many implications and some of these are suggested in terms of planning, education, bureaucracy, and conservation. Whilst an evaluation of the businesses created can only be done in the long term, Local Enterprise Facilitation has opened up some hope for communities seeking to create good work.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">unemployment</field><field name="subject">local communities</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">Local Enterprise Facilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.143953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Chinese Steel Industry in the Economic Development of China and Australia&#146;s Contribution to the Industry as a Supplier of Raw Materials</field><field name="creator">James G. Trench</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to examine the extent to which the iron and steel industry in China has been a major contributor to the recent economic development and growth of the Chinese economy and whether this will continue. Key elements of China&#146;s economic development model &#150; THE CHINESE MODEL - based on the steel industry are presented and demonstrate the impact of China taking &#147;great leaps forward&#148; in its steel production capacity to become the world&#146;s leading steel producer and one of the fastest growing economies. This bold step was undertaken at times when the global steel industry was burdened with overcapacity and economic pressures. At the same time, this thesis examines the role played by the Australian iron ore industry in supporting the Chinese steel industry through its iron ore trade with China and how this role will evolve.

The development of the iron and steel industry in China reflects not just the role played in the overall expansion of the Chinese economy through technical input-output relationships, but it also reflects control and historical characteristics taken from China's social and political context. Starting from the views of Sun Yat Sen, and flowing through Mao Zedong, and then into later leaders, the steel industry was always intended to be the basis for the modernisation of the Chinese economy. The Great Leap Forward of the 1950s was an ill-founded reflection of that fundamental view, but the failure in that case did not cause a shift away from that basic perspective. Instead a more comprehensive perspective was provided and this came to the fore at the start of there form process in the early 1980s.The role of the steel industry in the recent modernisation of China is traced using the policy foundations and directions that were adopted combined with empirical data on the investment and growth in the industry, as well as the role of the output of the steel industry in the expansion of other industries in China. To the extent that conditions in China may be replicated in other countries, the Chinese experience using the iron and steel industry as the key element in the industrialisation of that economy will have important lessons.

At the same time, this thesis demonstrates weaknesses in a development model that has the iron and steel industry as the leading sector. One major weakness is the reliance on imported raw materials and at this point the Chinese experience with Australia as a source of raw materials becomes relevant. Australia&#146;s role as a reliable supplier and partner for the steel industry enabled the steel industry to expand in a low risk environment with respect to the price and availability of raw materials.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great leap Forward</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Steel industry</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040820.144619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floral Biology and Propagation of Blue-Flowered Conospermum Spp.</field><field name="creator">Lynleys@calm.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Blue-flowered Conospermum are endemic to Western Australia, and show great potential as cut flowers.  Propagation from cuttings or seed proved difficult, and root initiation in vitro is problematic.  This thesis examines the floral biology of the species and the possibility of using somatic embryogenesis to overcome propagation problems.  

A survey of explant tissue types for C. eatoniae and C. caeruleum was carried out to identify tissue that could be induced into embryogenic pathways.  Vegetative, semi-floral and floral buds were initiated into culture from February to June, but were found unsuitable for embryogenesis, producing shoots, callus or dying in culture.  Leaves from in vitro leaf cultures formed callus in the presence of 2,4-D and BAP, but were unable to differentiate into embryos in the presence of a variety of growth regulator combinations and concentrations.  Immature zygotes died in culture.  Direct embryogenesis and/or embryogenic callus was observed on mature zygotes of the species C. caeruleum, C. spectabile, C. dorrienii and C. brownii, and somatic embryos were maintained in culture for up to 18 months for C. caeruleum.  

Maturation and germination of somatic embryos proved difficult; treatments of cold, ABA, desiccation or mannitol did not induce maturation.  It appears that developmental pathways in Conospermum are well defined and are difficult to alter in vitro.  It was concluded that somatic embryogenesis has limited commercial potential in these species.

Conospermum species have an active pollination mechanism where the style is held in a state of tension when the flower opens.  When pressure is applied at the base of the style by an insect, the style flicks downwards, striking the insect pollinator and releasing pollen from the anther in a single dusty mass.  However, the breeding systems of blue-flowered Conospermum have not previously been well explored.

  Flowers on a C. eatoniae inflorescence opened from the basal end upwards acropetally, with the terminal two or three buds never opening.  Fruit and seed set occurred only from the basal one to three buds.  Isolation of C. eatoniae and C. amoenum flowers showed they were unable to self-pollinate in the absence of insect pollinators.  

Experiments to determine the timing of the peak of stigmatic receptiveness were inconclusive.  Pollen germinated and penetrated the stigma 0 &#161;V 6 days after anther dehiscence.  Pollen loads on the stigma did not relate to the number of pollen tubes observed down the style.  Controlled pollinations of cultivated C. eatoniae at a field station using self and cross pollen, revealed compatibility with a range of pollen genotypes, as pollen tubes were observed extending down the style.  However, late-acting incompatibility could not be ruled out as controlled crosses failed to set any seed as flowers were shed from the bush.  

DNA analysis of open pollinated C. eatoniae seed progeny from two plants from a field station and two plants in natural bushland revealed very different pollination habits.  Plants from the field station showed no outcrossing, with progeny closely resembling the maternal parent, whereas plants from the wild population showed outcrossing with several different paternal parents.  These results suggest self-pollinated seed can be reliably obtained in a plantation situation using stands of ramets of the same clone. Alternatively, assuming that the required insect pollinators are present in a cultivated stand, it should be possible to obtain cross pollinated seed by surrounding the maternal plant with the desired paternal parent.

Unusual pollen behaviour was observed for many blue-flowered species, a white-flowered species of Conospermum, and close relative, Synaphea petiolaris.  Up to three pollen tubes emerged from the triporate pollen in vitro, and at rates of up to 55 &#131;&#221;ms-1.  This rate was maintained for only 2 s but is greater than 20 times faster than reported in the literature for any species, in vitro or in vivo.  Pollen with multiple tubes was also observed on the stigma in vivo in C. amoenum flowers.

Changing the osmotic pressure of the germination medium by altering sucrose concentration influenced the number of tubes to emerge from the pollen grain; generally the number of tubes decreased as sucrose increased.  However, the rate of tube growth was unaffected.  The addition of calcium channel blockers to the germination medium had no effect on Conospermum growth rate, nor did they eliminate pulses of tube growth.

Observation of Conospermum pollen ultrastructure revealed similarities to Gramineae pollen.  The tube cytoplasm was packed with vesicles filled with material of similar electron density to the cell wall.  Few golgi were identified, and the apical end of the tube contained these vesicles, smaller secretory vesicles and mitochondria.  This is atypical of the tip, which is normally free of large vesicles.  Distinct zones in the cytoplasm were not identified, which is similar to Gramineae.  Like the grasses, Conospermum appears to pre-manufacture cell wall material and store it in vesicles ready for rapid germination and extension.

A biological function of multiple pollen tube emergence with such rapid growth was not elucidated.

This research has shown Conospermum to be a complex and very interesting genus. Further investigation into the remarkable growth of multiple pollen tubes would enhance our knowledge of the biological processes involved in tube growth and the process of fast wall formation. The potential benefits to the cut flower industry of commercialising some of these species warrants further effort to find an efficient method of propagation. Introduction into horticulture may be the only means by which these threatened species will survive.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Somatic embryogenesis</field><field name="subject">conospermum</field><field name="subject">pollen tube ultrastructure</field><field name="subject">pollen tube growth rate.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040824.145625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relation between distress-risk, B/M and return: Is it consistent with rational pricing?</field><field name="creator">k.zaretzky@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Fama and French (1995, 1996) argue that the high-minus-low (HML) book-tomarket (B/M) factor in their 1993 three-factor model is a proxy for a distress-risk return premium and that the model is consistent with rational pricing. Alternative views are that the HML premium is caused by irrational behaviour or market inefficiencies.

Dichev (1998) finds that high distress-risk firms have low, not high, B/M and earn low returns. He also finds a systematic relation between the distress-risk characteristic and return, independent of the B/M characteristic. The effect of differences in the methodology used by Fama and French (1995) and Dichev (1998) has not been examined. In addition, there is no evidence of whether a distress-risk return premium is important in describing returns.

Examination of the characteristics and returns of sorted distress-risk portfolios shows that most high distress-risk, positive book-equity NYSE-AMEX firms do have high B/M. However, for both the NYSE-AMEX and NASDAQ, small firms with high distress-risk have low B/M ratios. A positive relation between distress-risk and return is not found for either NYSE-AMEX or NASDAQ firms. A distress-minus-solvent (DMS) return premium constructed using Fama and French (1993) methodology is negative and significant. 

Regression results show that both the HML and the DMS factors are important in describing the time-series of returns. However, the HML factor is of only marginal importance when examining sorted distress-risk portfolio returns. In addition, the HML coefficients are related to the B/M characteristic, rather than distress-risk, when both sorted distress-risk and characteristic-balanced portfolio returns are examined.

The combined evidence suggests that HML cannot be interpreted as a return premium related to financial distress. However, a systematic relation does exist between distress-risk and return. The evidence supports a market inefficiency or irrational behaviour, rather than a risk based explanation of asset returns. Investors pay too much for financially distressed firms and subsequently earn low returns.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asset pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040825.110542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School Governance: Phases, Participation and Paradoxes</field><field name="creator">l.payne@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This research analyses the governance structures and processes of thirteen independent primary schools in Perth, and one state primary school in Western Australia termed an &#145;alternative&#146; or &#145;lighthouse&#146; school. More in-depth case studies were undertaken at five sites with participants from different time periods. All the schools had a school council or board since their foundations and notably all schools had their origins in the period of the alternative school and community empowerment movement of the 1970s and 1980s. 

In an era of market reform and the corporatisation of schools, the critical areas of focus for this research were: how community expectations and school identity were maintained within council-governed schools; how democratic imperatives compete with professionalism and school improvement issues; and how schools confront dilemmas of governance. Three frameworks, Phases of Development, Community Empowerment and Dilemmas, were employed as useful means to discuss school governance. The results revealed changes in governance over time. Schools began to envisage themselves less as communities and more as businesses. The emphasis was away from parent involvement and towards efficiency and commercial practices. Tensions and dilemmas arose out of these changes.

The thesis concluded that it was not the structures or individuals that were crucial in governance processes but the playing out of particular tensions and dilemmas.

Black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) appear to be an ideal candidate for the developing saline aquaculture industry of inland Western Australia, however their current maximum growth rates are too slow for profitable production. The high productivity of modern breeds of terrestrial livestock species is primarily due to genetic improvement programs utilising selective breeding, and similar gains have also been made where they have been implemented for aquatic species. Before the growth rate of black bream can be genetically improved, however, it is necessary to estimate both the extent of genetic improvement required and the extent of genetic (co)variation in those growth traits which will be subject to, or affected by, selection. The aims of this study were to:

(1) Determine the extent of genetic improvement in growth rate required for black bream to be considered as a profitable aquaculture species.
(2) Estimate the potential for growth rate to be improved through heterosis when different black bream strains are crossbred.
(3) Estimate the additive genetic variation for growth rate, which exists within populations of black bream.
(4) Estimate the genetic (co)variation which exists between growth rate and other production traits.

A partial budget analysis investigated whether enhanced growth rates of black bream would improve profitability and justify a genetic improvement program. It was conducted for two different fish production systems; a commercial operation that incurred more operating expenses due to costs associated with farm initiation (stand-alone farm model) and an existing farm that diversified into aquaculture using the saline water resources of established farm dams (integrated farm model). Sensitivity analyses indicated that a 33% increase in growth rate to at least 200g/annum would allow either production system to return a profit at a farm-gate price of AUS$6/kg whole fish, with fish survival rates of 98% for the stand-alone farm and 65% for the integrated farm model. These results provided a breeding objective, being an improvement in growth rate by at least 33%.

A complete diallel cross of two black bream populations was used to estimate the comparative advantages that might be gained from straight-breeding and crossbreeding. At 90 days of age, the growth traits of standard length, total length and wet weight, varied significantly among all straight-bred and crossbred lines, and among half-sib groups within lines. Differences among half-sib groups explained 6.8% of the total variance in standard length, 8.3% in total length and 7.1% in wet weight, giving estimated heritabilities over all lines of 0.27 &#177; 0.11 for standard length, 0.33 &#177; 0.13 for total length and 0.28 &#177; 0.12 for wet weight. There was no evidence for heterosis in any traits when straight-bred and crossbred lines were compared, and phenotypic (rP = 0.95 &#150; 0.98) and genetic (rG = 0.63 &#150; 0.69) correlations were high among all growth traits.

I used the estimated heritability for wet weight of 0.28 to optimise a factorial mating design from a single population, and to estimate the contribution of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic and maternal effects to variation in growth traits of black bream at 75, 130 and 180 days of age in the hatchery. Maternal genetic and environmental effects were greatest at 75 days of age, accounting for 9.1% of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 11.4% of variance in standard length and 8.8% of variance in total length. At later ages maternal effects were much reduced, explaining 0.8 &#150; 3.7% of phenotypic variance in growth traits. Additive genetic effects were greatest at 130 days of age, when they accounted for 17.4% of total phenotypic variance in wet weight, 21.4% of variance in standard length and 18.7% of variance in total length. Additive genetic effects were negligible (&lt;1%) at 75 days of age and 4.8 &#150; 5.5% of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 180 days of age. Non-additive genetic effects (which also included common environmental effects due to families being raised in the same tank) explained 5.8 &#150; 7.3% of total phenotypic variance in growth traits at 75 days of age, but were much smaller at later ages. Variable stocking densities among tanks up to 75 days significantly affected all growth trait measurements below 180 days of age.

One of the most important of these traits is feed conversion efficiency. Feed conversion
efficiency (FCE) is the effectiveness with which feed is converted to saleable fish product. Feed costs are a major input to aquaculture production systems and genetic changes in FCE may therefore have an important influence on profitability. FCE is usually expressed by a composite measure that combines feed intake and growth rate. The two most common measures are feed conversion ratio (feed intake/weight gain over a specified time interval) and its inverse, feed efficiency. Feed conversion ratio and feed efficiency are measures of gross FCE, because they do not distinguish between the separate energy requirements of growth and maintenance. There is abundant evidence of substantial genetic variation in FCE and its component traits in terrestrial livestock species and, although data are few, the same is likely for cultured fish species. The major problems with selecting from this variation to genetically improve FCE in fish species are:

&#149; It appears impractical to measure feed intake on individual fish, so that family mean data must be used.
&#149; We do not know the optimal time period over which to test fish for FCE.
&#149; We do not know the genetic correlations between FCE under apparent satiation or restricted intake conditions, or between FCE at different times in the production cycle.

I measured the relationships between feed intake to apparent satiety and weight gain in replicate half-sib families of black bream at four times over a 56-day test period. After 42 days, I found significant additive genetic variance in both weight gain and feed intake, and a stabilisation in family group variation in both traits. This indicates that 42 days is the minimum test period over which to measure genetic variation for FCE in black bream. There were high, positive phenotypic (and probably genetic) correlations between weight gain and feed intake after 42 days. There was no detectable genetic variation for either feed efficiency (weight gain/feed intake), or residual feed intake, which is the difference between the actual feed intake of an individual and the intake predicted from its body weight and growth rate. I argue that selection for improved FCE might be better achieved not by using a composite measure, but by using a weighted selection index that accounts for the genetic covariance among weight gain, feed intake and other correlated traits.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Improvement</field><field name="subject">selection</field><field name="subject">black bream</field><field name="subject">inland saline aquaculture</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040901.133809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trawling Deeper Seas: the Gendered Production of Seafood in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">Leonie C. Stella</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the sexual division of labour in three worksites associated with the Western Australian Fishing industry: fishers' households, a seafood processing company and fishing vessels. There has been no previous substantial study of the labour of women in Australian fishing industries. 

My research has been primarily undertaken by interviewing women and men who work in the Western Australian fishing industry, and my findings are presented through a comparison with overseas literature relative to each site. 

As I found, in the households of fishermen, women do unpaid and undervalued labour which includes servicing men and children; managing household finances and operating fishing enterprises. In seafood processing companies women are allocated the lowest paid and least rewarding work which is regarded as "women's work". On-the factory floor issues of class, race/ ethnicity and gender intersect so that the majority of women employed in hands-on processing work are migrant women froma non-English speaking background. The majority of women who work at sea are cook/ deckhands who are confronted by a rigid sexual division of labour, and work in a hyper-masculine workplace.

The few other women who have found a niche which enables them to enjoy an outdoor lifestyle while they earn their own living, are those who work as autonomous independent small boat fishers. In each site there is evidence that women, individually and collectively, exercise some power in determining how and where they work, but they remain marginalised from the more lucrative sites of the industry, and have limited access to economic and social power.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sexual division of labor</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination against women</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination in employment</field><field name="subject">Women fishers</field><field name="subject">Women fish trade</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040913.155811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposures and Health Effects among Field Workers using the Organophosphate Chlorpyrifos</field><field name="creator">marcus.cattani@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">Chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide moderately toxic to humans via inhalation and dermal absorption (LD50 oral, rat = 226 mg kg-1, LD50 skin, rabbits = 1265 mg kg-1), is widely used to eradicate termites in Australia. A series of 28 surveys totaling 32 separate assessments, or 10% of all professional users in Perth, Western Australia, comprised biological monitoring, exposure assessment techniques, a health symptoms and work practices questionnaire. Chlorpyrifos metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and alkyl phosphates were extracted from urine, and serum cholinesterase (SChE) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase from blood. Chlorpyrifos was extracted from 24 patches removed from a supplied cotton overall, cotton gloves worn under protective gloves, 7 absorbent patches placed on the skin and an organic vapour collection tube. Surface wipes were collected in the workers vehicle and on the workers forehead. Chlorpyrifos was applied in either 0.5% (n=2) or 1% (n=26) concentration of active ingredient in water solution. Surveys took place at pre-construction sites (n=5) where pesticide was sprayed onto a prepared site, existing buildings with concrete foundations (n=17) where pesticide was injected under pressure around the perimeter of the building and existing buildings with suspended floors requiring the worker to spray under floor (n=6). Combined left and right glove deposition was 9 mg hour- 1 (SD = 18 mg.hour-1). Mean deposition on overalls was 14 mg.hour-1 (SD = 12 mg.hour-1), on skin patches was 0.2 &#131;&#221;g.cm-1.hour-1, on vehicle gear-stick was 3 &#131;&#221;g (SD = 8 &#131;&#221;g) and, on steering wheels&#161;&#166; was 3 &#131;&#221;g (SD = 3 &#131;&#221;g). The mean protection 4 factor of overalls, a ratio of outer layer and inner levels, was 75 (SD = 411).

Mean air concentration of chlorpyrifos during an application was 30 &#131;&#221;g m-3, and 17 &#131;&#221;g m-3 8 hour TWA (SD = 40 &#131;&#221;g m-3 8 hour TWA), and in one group of 17 workers correlated (p&lt;0.05) with ambient air temperature (15 to 38 oC). Urinary metabolites and SChE activity were effective indicators of exposure. The health symptoms questionnaire did not highlight significant health effects. A discrepancy between operators&#161;&#166; perception of risk and their actual exposure requires addressing, for example the measured high deposition rate to hands was ineffectively controlled, as 48% or workers wore inappropriate or no gloves and only 26% washed their hands after completing their tasks. All workers indicated in the questionnaire they would wash their hands after completing their tasks. The questionnaire also highlighted a high incidence of poor work practices, 58% spilt the concentrate at least once a week, 74% had recently spilt/splashed diluted chlorpyrifos in their eyes and 90% on their boots, and 52% believed they would benefit from more education concerning chlorpyrifos. Observations concluded that workers unnecessarily increased their exposure by poor work practice.

Recommendations include modification to pesticide worker education, licencing and health surveillance systems; an improvement in the understanding of the benefits of a health and safety management systems for employers, and pesticide suppliers taking a stewardship role in the usage of their products.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological monitoring</field><field name="subject">occupational exposure</field><field name="subject">health surveillance</field><field name="subject">chlorpyrisos</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040921.121425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trauma and Attachment: The Impact of Domestic Violence on Pre-School Children</field><field name="creator">bboultwd@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The effect of domestic violence on the lives of young children and how the children are affected by their mothers' exposure to domestic violence.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic Violence</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">women's refuges</field><field name="subject">caregivers</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040929.134144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding Strategies and Community Structure in an Assemblage of Tropical Seabirds on the Lowendal Islands, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Lisa Nicholson</field><field name="description">Information about tropical seabird communities is less abundant in the literature than for those that occur at higher latitudes. In research papers examining seabird breeding communities in tropical environments, it has been found that food availability was temporally and spatially variable in comparison to higher latitudes. This environmental variability would be expected to influence the life-history traits of tropical seabird species, and in turn, the structure of the communities in which they occur.  To examine the impact of environmental variability upon the life-history traits and community structure of tropical seabirds, a comparative study of the breeding strategies of three tropical tern species and an outlier, shearwater species was carried out, at the Lowendal Islands, Western Australia (20o39&#146;52S; 115o34&#146;44E) between 1996 and 2000. 

Bridled Terns Sterna anaethetus and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters Puffinus pacificus shared the life-history traits of migration or dispersal from the breeding colony and east-Indian Ocean metapopulation when not breeding, a summer breeding schedule, nest-site fidelity, concealed nest-sites, clutch size of one, offshore and pelagic foraging regime, and protracted post-natal growth.  Crested Terns Sterna bergii and Lesser Crested Terns Stern bengalenis bred within the same colony and shared the life-history traits of presence at the breeding colony when not breeding, an autumn breeding schedule, change in colony site each season, open dense nest-sites, brood size of one. inshore foraging regime (as well as offshore for Crested Terns) and rapid post-natal growth. 

It was found that each species experienced variation in nest-site occupancy and/or colony size, as well as variation in timing of breeding and breeding success between years.  The effects upon each species seemed to operate independently, as concurrently breeding species did not appear affected by the same events, with the exception of cyclones.  Late and/or poor breeding success in a species often coincided with oceanographic changes in the north-west region, such as fluctuations in the strength of flow and temperature of the Leewin Current.  The Leewin Current is a warm water, low salinity current flowing southwards along most of the Western Australian coastline and has a stronger, warmer flow during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Cyclone activity is also influenced by ENSO induced changes in the region&#146;s water temperature. Changes in the Leewin Current affected the timing of breeding for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, and feeding conditions for all study species, presumably as a result of changes in prey availability, while cyclone events delayed breeding for Crested Terns and Lesser Shearwaters in the years studied.  Cyclone events were the most obvious cause of re-laying in the case of Crested Terns and Lesser Crested Terns, and breeding failure in the case of Bridled Terns and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters.  Breeding failure was common among later breeders in the Crested Tern colonies.  Breeding success was relatively high for lesser Crested Terns in all years studied, as they hatched and fledged their chicks within the Crested Tern colony among the first wave of breeders.  

There was some overlap in the diets and foraging grounds of the four study species.  Crested terns and Lesser Crested Terns had the most similar diet, however, Crested Terns appeared to be the most opportunistic foragers, with the highest diversity of dietary prey, while Lesser Crested Terns diet consisted of a high proportion of atherinids.  Bridled Terns has the next highest prey diversity, while half the diet of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters in this region, similar to conspecifics elsewhere, consisted of squid.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters were observed to be offshore and pelagic foragers.  Their distribution in the waters surrounding the Lowendal Islands ranged to the full extent of observation transects(63 Km), and most likely beyond, excluding inshore waters (i.e. within 5 km of islands).  They were not present in the vicinity of the Lowendal Islands when they were not breeding.  Bridled Terns were observed to be offshore foragers, also ranging to the full extent of transects, and most likely beyond, occasionally including inshore waters.  They were rarely observed when not breeding, with the exception of a small number of fledglings at the end of the breeding season.  Crested Terns were observed to combine inshore and offshore foraging grounds, only ranging to the full extent of transects during their breeding season.  Lesser Crested Terns were observed foraging inshore only. 

Chick provisioning, in terms of meal size and frequency, varied between years and within seasons for all species.  It was demonstrated that there were differences in mean corrected meal sizes between years for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, and the same was inferred from chick growth curves for Bridled Terns.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters provisioned their chicks with larger meal sizes and a higher occurrence of double feeds in 1996/97 than in other years studied.  The amount of time spent feeding chicks in the burrow by Wedge-tailed Shearwaters adults became shorter as the breeding season progressed.  It was demonstrated that all three tern species increased the meal size delivered to chicks as they grew.  Wedge-tailed Shearwaters did not increase meal size as the season progressed, however they did increase feeding frequency.  The feeding frequency of Crested Terns was highest in 1999, nearly doubling that observed in 1997 and 1998.  In 1998 Lesser Crested Terns fed their chicks up to six times more frequently than Crested Terns. 

Chick growth varied for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Bridled Terns between seasons.  Bridled Tern chicks grew more rapidly in 1997/98, were heavier and reached higher asymptotes for all linear parameters, the exception of wing length, than in 2000.  On the other hand, Wedge-tailed Shearwater chicks grew more rapidly in 1999/2000 than in 1997/98, however, they attained similar asymototes for all parameters in both years.  In the absence of repeat measures of same individuals, Crested Tern and Lesser Crested tern growth was examined using age categorization based on wing and tail feather development.  Both species appeared to attain similar sizes at similar rates in each year.  

Wedge-tailed Shearwaters accumulated weight up to 30% in excess of mean adult weight in all seasons. This is a common trait exhibited in procellarigorms, and some weight loss occurs prior to fledging.  It is suggested, based upon evidence from other studies in which weight loss prior to fledging was found to be water loss, that lipid accumulation acts as an insurance for the period after fledging when young are leaning to forage for themselves.  

The information gathered for this project found no direct evidence of competition among the species comprising the seabird community if Lowendal Islands.  Niche overlap occurred amongst all species, particularly in the case of lesser Crested Terns and Crested Terns, which shared breeding phenology, breeding colonies, foraging grounds and dietary overlap.  Niche overlap also occurred between Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and Bridled Terns, which shared breeding phenology and foraging grounds.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seabird breeding</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Wedge-tailed Shearwaters</field><field name="subject">Bridled Terns</field><field name="subject">Lowendal Islands</field><field name="subject">Crested Terns</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040929.134652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Downstream Target Genes of the T-cell Oncoprotein HOX11 by Global Gene Expression Profiling</field><field name="creator">Darcelle@gmail.com</field><field name="description">HOX11 is a homeodomain transcription factor that has been implicated in leukaemic transformation associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Its role in leukaemogenesis remains enigmatic, nevertheless, in vitro and in vivo studies have provided additional evidence supporting the role of HOX11 as an oncogene. The mechanism by which HOX11 transforms cells is yet to be elucidated, however, HOX11 has been postulated to function by binding regulatory elements within the promoter regions of specific target genes in order to control gene transcription. The identification of transcriptional targets is thus thought to be critical to our understanding of the pathways controlled by this master gene regulator. To date, only three candidate HOX11 target genes have been reported and given that HOX11 overexpression can have a profound impact on cell behaviour, it is likely that many more exist. In this study, we sought to further understand the role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis by: 1) The identification of novel putative HOX11 target genes by profiling gene expression in response to HOX11 in a number of cell lines using a combination of RDA, cDNA microarray and GeneChip approaches and 2) confirming target gene status by assessing whether the proximal promoters of the leading candidates identified are transcriptionally regulated by HOX11.

To identify genes whose expression was altered by HOX11, three techniques were employed, namely representational difference analysis, cDNA microarray and Affymetrix GeneChip array. Because of the relative novelty of these technologies, all three methods were employed in a complementary manner. While representational difference analysis did not require dedicated equipment and enabled the identification of novel genes, the technique was labour-intensive and also exhibited a number of problems including high levels of background. Emphasis was therefore placed on the more systematic microarray approaches that enabled a global investigation of expression patterns and thus the identification of a range of candidate target genes. Initially, this involved cDNA microarray experiments, however, during the course of this work Affymetrix GeneChip technology became available. The latter was identified as the most appropriate technology for the identification of candidate target genes because of its relative ease of use, as well as its employment of multiple independent probe pairs which greatly improved background noise, increased the range and accuracy of detection, minimized the effects of cross hybridization and drastically reduced the rate of false positives and miscalls.

Using these combined approaches, several genes of interest were identified which were differentially regulated in the presence of HOX11 and thus may represent oncogenically or physiologically relevant target genes. These included OSTEOPONTIN, PAG, GUANOSINE DIPHOSPHATE DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR 3, SUR8, GAS3, C-KIT, VEGFC, NOR1 and SMARCD3. In order to confirm their role as target genes, four candidates (C-KIT, VEGFC, NOR1 and SMARCD3) were characterized in terms of the ability of their proximal promoters to be transcriptionally regulated by HOX11 using luciferase reporter assays. Significant repression of the proximal promoters of C-KIT and VEGFC by HOX11 was observed, which provided further evidence for their status as target genes. This repression was, however, in stark contrast to the transcriptional activation seen when the C-KIT and VEGFC proximal promoters were co-transfected with a HOX11 mutant lacking the third helix of the DNA-binding homeodomain. This unexpected finding suggested that the transcriptional activity of HOX11 is complex and highly context-dependent, and in particular, highlighted the importance of an intact homeodomain for HOX11 function.

C-KIT and VEGFC are both involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways, as a receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinase ligand, respectively. C-KIT plays an important role in the survival and self-renewal of haematopoietic cells. It is a previously identified and relatively well characterized oncogene known to be regulated by other transcription factors (SCL/TAL1 and LMO) implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. VEGFC is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family that functions in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. A paracrine loop involving VEGFC and its receptor VEGFR-3 has previously been implicated in leukaemic cell survival. While further work is required in order to confirm the status of VEGFC and C-KIT as oncogenically-relevant HOX11 target genes and to characterize their exact mode of regulation, these findings implicate receptor tyrosine kinases in HOX11-mediated tumorigenesis and underscore their  potential importance as therapeutic targets in haematological malignancies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Target genes</field><field name="subject">HOX11</field><field name="subject">leukaemia</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20040929.143814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Digital Diva: Women on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">C.Kilpin@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In the year 2000, American researchers reported that women constituted 51 percent of Internet users. This was a significant discovery, as throughout the medium&#146;s history, women were outnumbered by men as both users and builders of sites. This thesis probes not only this historical moment of change, but how women are mobilising the World Wide Web in their work, leisure and lives. 

Not considered in the &#145;51% of American women now online&#146; headline is the lack of women engaged in Web building rather than Web shopping. In technical fields relating to the Web, women are outnumbered and marginalized, being poorly represented in computer-related college and university courses, in careers in computer science and computer programming, and also in digital policy. This thesis identifies the causes for the low number of women in these spheres. I consider the social and cultural reasons for their exclusion and explore the discourses which operate to discourage women&#146;s participation. 

My original contribution to knowledge is forged as much through how this thesis is written as by the words and footnotes that graze these pages. With strong attention to methodology in Web-based research, I gather a plurality of women&#146;s voices and experiences of under-confidence, humiliation and fear. Continuing the initiatives of Dale Spender&#146;s Nattering on the Net, I research women&#146;s use of the Web in placing a voice behind the statistics. I also offer strategies for digital intervention, without easy platitudes to the &#145;potential&#146; for women in the knowledge economy or through Creative Industries strategies.

The chapters of this thesis examine the contexts in which exclusionary attitudes are created and perpetuated. No technology is self-standing: we gain information about &#145;new&#146; technologies from the old. I investigate representations and mediations of women&#146;s relationship to the Web in fields including the media, the workplace, fiction, the Creative Industries and educational institutions. For example, the media is complicit in causing women to doubt their technological capabilities. The images and ideologies of women in film, newspapers and magazines that present computer and Web usage are often discriminatory and derogatory. I also found in educational institutions that patriarchal attitudes privilege men, and discourage female students&#146; interest in digital technologies. I interviewed high school and university students and found that the cultural values embedded within curricula discriminate against women. Limitations in Web-based learning were also discovered. 

In discussing the cultural and social foundations for women&#146;s absence or under-confidence in technological fields, I engage with many theories from a prominent digital academic: Dale Spender. In her book Nattering on the Net: Women, Power and Cyberspace, Spender&#146;s outlook is admonitory. She believes that unless women acquire a level of technological capital equal to their male counterparts, women will continue to be marginalised as new political and social ideologies develop. She believes women&#146;s digital education must occur as soon as possible. While I welcome her arguments, I also found that Spender did not address the confluence between the analogue and the digital. She did not explore how the old media is shaping the new. While Spender&#146;s research focused on the Internet, I ponder her theses in the context of the World Wide Web. 

In order to intervene in the patriarchal paradigm, to move women beyond digital shoppers and into builders of the digital world, I have created a website (included on CD-ROM) to accompany this thesis&#146;s arguments. It presents links to many sites on the Web to demonstrate how women are challenging the masculine inscriptions of digital technology. Although the website is created to interact directly with Chapter Three, its content is applicable to all parts of the thesis.

This thesis is situated between cultural studies and internet studies. This interdisciplinary dialogue has proved beneficial, allowing socio-technical research to resonate with wider political applications. The importance of intervention - and the need for change - has guided my words. Throughout the research and writing process of this thesis, organisations have released reports claiming gender equity on the Web. My task is to capture the voice, views and fears of the women behind these statistics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Media</field><field name="subject">Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Creative Industries</field><field name="subject">Workplace</field><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">Librarians</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041001.92507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the haematology, physiology and biochemistry of the blood of the lamprey Geotria australis Gray</field><field name="creator">d.macey@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Various cytological, physiological and biochemical properties of the blood have been examined in different life cycle stages of the lamprey Geotria australia.

Initial experiments to determine physiologically realistic upper temperatures yielded an ultimate lethal temperature for larvae of 28.3oC.  Since this value is comparatively low, it helps explain the restriction of G. australis to more southern rivers in Australia.  

The haematocrit (46.2%), red blood cell number (1.231 X 106 cells mm-3) and haemoglobin concentration (11.8g 100ml-l) of adult G. australis are more typical of comparable stages in holarctic lampreys than those of their ammocoetes (41.5%, 1.809 106 cells mm-3, 11.1 g 100 ml-1). During metamorphosis, the pattern of change in haemopoietic sites, haemoglobin electropherograms and the proportion of mature erythrocytes, indicate that erythrocytes containing larval and adult haemoglobins always originate in different structures.  The molecular weights (c 17000) and pI values (5.1-6.4) of G. australis haemoglobins are similar to those of other lampreys.  The P50 of larval blood is very low, while that of adult blood is more comparable to that of other lampreys (cf. 0.92 mm Hg for ammocoete and 10.3 mm Hg for adult at pH 7.75 and 15oC). Increases in temperature do not affect the Bohr shift (range -0.16 to -0.27) but are accompanied by a shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. 

The major plasma iron binding proteins have molecular weights of 354,000 in the ammocoete and 296,000 in the adult and contain 20 and 4 subunits respectively.  The larval IBP is thus ferritin-like while that of the adult is transferring-like, features consistent with their respective pI values, Fe/protein ratios and ultrastructure.  Total plasma iron was 19,760 ug 100 ml-1 in larvae and 34 ug 100 ml-1 in adults. Iron granules were present in the columnar cells of the posterior intestine in small or negligible amounts in the Petromyzonidae and in very large amounts in the Mordaciidea.  While some iron was found in the same location in the Geotriidae, it was also present in very large concentrations elsewhere in the body.  

The high haemoglobin concentration and blood iron levels, and the large iron deposits and the low P50 in larval G. australis, probably represent adaptations to reduced environmental oxygen tensions.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lamprey Geotria australis Gray</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041011.144205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marriage, Migration and the International Marriage Business in Japan</field><field name="creator">Tomoko Nakamatsu</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the international marriage business in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s, and the experiences of female participants from China, South Korea, and the Philippines who married through this system and currently live in Japan.

The study treats these women as active female migrants and contributes to a gendered understanding of the process of contemporary migration. The thesis argues for an acknowledgement of the way in which the international marriage business served the purposes of marriage and migration for women in male dominant and economically stratified societies in Asia, without downplaying the fact that the same system and its ideology oppresses women. The study argues that, for these women, participation in international marriage by introduction was about marriage and migration. Analysis of the intricate sites of marriage and migration was thus critical to understanding their experiences. The thesis also argues for recognition of the diverse and complex experiences of the women participants.

Part I of this study investigates the macro-economic, social and political factors that influenced development of the international marriage business in Japan. It analyses representations of international introduction marriage and its female participants, and maps the ways in which patriarchal gender ideology in the international marriage business system intersects with global capitalism, and other hegemonic power relations operating in contemporary Japan.

Part II examines the marriage and migration experiences of 45 women. The section identifies conflicts faced by the women and examines processes of negotiation inside and outside the family domain. It investigates the extent of the women's agency in their decision to many and live in a foreign country, covering interconnected arenas of marriage, family, paid work, involvement in women's groups and questions of legal citizenship. The women's narratives demonstrate the importance of articulating a structurally embedded analysis with active female agency in the study of international marriage migration.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marriage</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">arranged marriage</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041012.152339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of &#147;Third Culture Kids&#148;:The experiences of Australasian adults</field><field name="creator">rosalea.cameron@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The ecology of human development has been shown to be different for different cultures and sub-cultures within a particular culture, and to play a significant part in shaping the outcome traits or character profile exhibited by individuals who experience a given ecology. This is the case for members of that sub-culture of children who spend childhood years abroad; who expect to eventually repatriate to their passport country.

Those who experience the phenomenon have been called Third Culture Kids or TCKs, and the outcome profile for those with a North American background has been identified. However, no literature on children in the Australasian context exists. A progressive naturalistic study, using both qualitative and quantitative methodology, was undertaken providing foundational data on the experience of adult Australasians (Australians and New Zealanders) who had experienced such a childhood ecology. The Australasian self-reported reflections were compared with descriptions of the North American and international experience presented in existing literature. Further, accepted models of human development were merged and adapted to produce a TCK-specific model of human development. This model was a significant product of this research project. 

Components of particular importance to development that nurtured the outcome profile traits were identified and represented in the model. The study incorporated three phases: phase 1 involved the in-depth interview of 3 respondents who had experienced the TCK ecology on three different continents, phase 2 involved data collection on the demographics of the broader Australasian TCK population asking questions about family choices, education, and career trajectories (N=50), and phase 3 collected in-depth descriptions of the childhood TCK ecology through voluntary response to an extensive written survey and asked for comparison with the imagined alternative ecology had respondents remained in their passport country (N=45). In both phases 1 and 3 respondents were asked to describe character traits they believed they manifested as a direct result of immersion in the TCK ecology and then suggest traits they might otherwise have manifested had the imagined alternative ecology been the nurturing environment. Tabulation of the emerging data allowed comparison and contrast with the North American outcome profile traits that have been described in literature. In both tabulations many outcome profile traits were identified as being in polar contrast with each other; the TCK could manifest either or both of the apparently opposing traits.

Manifestation was dependent upon the immediate context within which the TCK was functioning. There was shown to be a significant overlap in the outcome profile for Australasians and North Americans. However, in this study Australasians presented stronger in their self-report of altered relational patterns and traits related to resourcefulness and practical abilities than was described in the North American literature. In comparing outcome profile traits of the real TCK ecology and those that were associated with the imagined alternative ecology respondents reported that they would have been more confident and more socially competent, but less tolerant and less globally aware had they been raised in the passport country. The self-reported outcome traits or profile were linked to the developmental ecology by exploring the processes and tensions that were at work. It was shown that dynamic tensions emerged and increased in valence as the individual gradually developed polarised traits that manifested according to engagement in the multiple contexts the TCK was required to manage. The results of this study have implications for those who deploy families abroad, as well as those who educate, and nurture the social potential of TCKs. This study has served to extend understanding of the phenomenon at the international level and laid a foundation for specific understanding of the Australasian context.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">reverse culture shock</field><field name="subject">return migration</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041014.111617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant Communities of Greenstone Hills of the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia as Analogues for the Rehabilitation of Rocky Waste Dumps</field><field name="creator">chalwell@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">The vegetation of greenstone hills in the Kalgoorlie area of the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia was studied to identify the key environmental influences on community and species distribution. This information was needed to determine if plant communities of the hills could provide analogues for the rehabilitation of waste rock dumps that are produced as a consequence of open cut mining.

The ridges, slopes and flats adjacent to the main slope were examined and the floristic data sorted into communities. Two structurally and floristically distinct alliances were identified, one dominated by eucalypt species and the other by Acacia quadrimarginea. The eucalypt woodland displayed a taller upper stratum and few groundlayer species and was the dominant vegetation of the flats at the base of the hills. The acacia community was a low woodland and is the dominant vegetation of the hill slopes. Both communities were dominant at an equal number of sites on the ridges of the hills.

An investigation of the environmental variables found that edaphic, rather than topographic, factors were responsible for the community distribution on the hills. The eucalypt woodland showed a strong affinity to soils derived from calcrete, which had higher levels of electrical conductivity and lower exchangeable sodium percentages than the soils of the acacia low woodland. Under such conditions, the clay fraction of the soil remains in a more flocculated state allowing higher rates of water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity compared to the acacia soils. Soil nutrients were found to have a secondary influence on community distribution and had a greater effect on species distribution within alliances.

A study of the seasonal variation in water content of the soils showed that more moisture is retained in the upper soil horizons in the acacia community than in the eucalypt community during the wetter part of the year, indicating the acacia soils had poorer infiltration properties than the eucalypt soils. The distribution of drought tolerant species such as A. quadrimarginea and Prostanthera incurvata was found to be correlated to soil moisture content of the dry season whilst no correlation was found for the eucalypts at any time of the year.

Seasonal comparisons of leaf moisture content and xylem pressure potential showed that the eucalypts maintained their total leaf moisture content throughout the year whereas species such as A. quadrimarginea and Allocasuarina campestris recorded high levels of desiccation of their leaf tissue over the summer. The eucalypts also maintained a more consistent pre-dawn xylem pressure potential throughout the year than either A. quadrimarginea or the shrub species Dodonaea microzyga, indicating a greater degree of stomatal control and access to a more consistent soil water supply. The eucalypts require access to a greater soil volume than the acacias or shrubs in order to ensure sufficient water supplies for the maintenance of tissue moisture levels throughout the year. In this way, the eucalypts are able to effectively avoid the summer drought, whereas the acacias and shrubs are able to tolerate desiccation of their leaf tissues over this period.

Investigations of the germination requirements and early seedling survival of prominent species from the greenstone hills indicated that fire may be a factor in the regeneration of most hills species. All studied species were either tolerant of or responded positively to the application of dry heat. In relation to seedling establishment on waste dumps, increasing the soil moisture content of waste dump soils increased the germination rate of most species but did not result in greater seedling survival at the end of the first summer. The provision of microsites which encouraged root development and provided protection for the young seedlings was found to be more important in reducing mortality rates in the first year than increasing the total germination.

The study emphasized the importance of physical soil factors and the soil moisture regime in the distribution of eucalypt and acacia communities on the greenstone hills. A species&#146; response to drought stress strongly influences its ability to compete for soil water on different soil types. The eucalypts studied in this project dominated on soils where there is better recharge of subsoil water reserves which can be accessed over the summer period to maintain tissue water levels. Acacias are tolerant of tissue desiccation and will compete successfully on shallower soils and where hydraulic conductivity is poor.

Although the project was valuable in identifying water relations as the main control on community distribution on the hills, waste dumps are not strictly analogues of intact greenstone hills due to the differences in rock type and profile formation. Electrical conductivity levels are also higher due to extraction processes. However, the environmental relationships of the different species show that the more drought tolerant species such as Allocasuarina campestris, Acacia quadrimarginea and understorey species associated with them, may be suitable species to form the basis of vegetation reinstatement on waste dumps in the Kalgoorlie region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mining waste</field><field name="subject">Eastern Goldfields Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant communities</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041014.113057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masculinities and Whiteness: The Shaping of Adolescent Male Students' Subjectivities in an Australian Boys' School</field><field name="creator">H.Hatchell@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In my thesis I explore way in which adolescent male students negotiate and interrogate discursive ideologies relating to hegemonic masculinities and to the normality of "whiteness", specifically within one English classroom in an Australian private single sex boys&#146; school in Perth, Western Australia.  A feminist poststructuralist theoretical framework is employed to explore how gendered and racialized positions available to adolescent males contribute to the shaping of their subjectivities, and how the social constructions of masculinities and femininities contribute to the ways in which adolescent males represent themselves. A quantitative approach, which included individual classroom observations, questionnaires and interviews, provided me with tools essential for examining the complexities of the effects of social constructs such as gender, sexuality and ethnicity on masculinist positionings at school.  The study reveals the complexities surrounding discourses of hegemonic heterosexual masculinities and privileges of whiteness on the situationally specific formation and negotiation of subjectivities in adolescent males&#146; lives in one school. 

Central findings of the study show that adolescent males in this single sex boys&#146; school easily maintained socially constructed ideas surrounding the feminisation of females and masculinization of males, with notions of homophobia embedded in discourses of hegemonic masculinities. A resistance to alternative masculine discourses shows the impact and maintenance of hegemonic heterosexual masculinities for adolescent males.  However, through the use of particular texts, female teachers in the all boys&#146; classroom were able to open up spaces for male students to interrogate hegemonic forms of masculinities, to interrogate power relationships, and to access alternative masculinities.  Ina similar vein, my findings show how easy it is for students to ignore social injustices in relation to racism and stereotyping of Indigenous Australians, and to retain notions that reinforce these injustices.  

A major conclusion of the study is that social injustices are easily maintained through educational institutions as active agents of reinforcing ideas and ideologies, particularly when changes mean disruption of privileges, such as privileges associated with hegemonic masculinity or with whiteness.  Although this study was conducted within a middle class milieu, and thus the students were from an advantaged position in life, this does not justify their ignorance of issues of social justice.  Indeed, the findings highlight the importance of this kind of critical approach with middle class boys in single sex schools.  Important implications of this study are that findings contribute to the discovery of ways of changing deeply ingrained ideologies such as perceived gender dichotomies, the masculinization of males and the feminisation of females.  My findings also contribute to ways in which privileges, such as whiteness, can be deconstructed and interrogated by those in privileged positions.  My findings have potential significant implications for pedagogical practices.  Education provides a means by which tools can be utilized to deconstruct and interrogate notices which maintain privileges, and in the study particularly white male privileges.  Within the educational systems, an understanding relating to how subjectivities are shaped within a classroom setting will also lead to greater educational insights into how specific texts and classroom interactions affect students&#146; self representation and understanding. Thus a gender equity and social justice curriculum committed to interrogating the ways in which male students subscribe, invest and negotiate hegemonic masculinities in advocated and has particular relevance to those males already in privileged class positions in terms of working towards a more socially just society.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenage boys</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">school curriculum</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041014.140411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of the Spotted Minnow, Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns 1842) (Pisces: Galaxiidae) on the South Coast of Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">fishyboy@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The spotted minnow, Galaxias maculatus has a widespread southern hemisphere and circum-polar distribution including south-western and south-eastern Australia. It was sampled at monthly intervals over 12-18 months, by seine and plankton netting at three localities including a freshwater lake, Moates Lake, and two intermittently flowing, naturally saline rivers, the Jerdacuttup and the Oldfield rivers on the south coast of Western Australia.

The resulting data provided an opportunity to describe the biology of G. maculatus in some detail including; environmental variables, life cycle, larval development, diet and parasitism by platyhelminth and nematode worms. Comparisons were made with other studies in south-east Australia, including Tasmania, and New Zealand. The present study confirmed that, at least throughout most of its range in Western Australia, G.  maculatus has established a self-sustaining land-locked reproductive strategy. It is hypothesised that the development of land-locked breeding is an adaptive response to changing coastal geomorphology in the Holocene period that restricted ocean access of rivers and their fauna and caused estuaries to become non-tidal.

The principal conclusion arising is that the local biology differs largely in degree rather than kind from elsewhere it has been studied; differences in degree are interpreted as local adaptations to an environment that is both variable and unpredictable  Field measurement of environmental variables revealed G. maculatus will withstand salinities to approximately 46 ppt and surface water temperatures to 280 c. Very low dissolved oxygen concentrations to &lt;1.0 mg r1 are accommodated by practicing secondary aerial respiration at the water surface.

Galaxias maculatus on the south coast of Western Australia were smaller than those reported from populations elsewhere. Overall tota11engths of Western Australian males and females ranged 23-132 mm compared to 38-187 mm length to caudal fork for south-west Victoria, 31-185 mm standard length for Tasmania and 40-152 mm length to caudal fork for New Zealand fish. In the present study, size varied between the lake and one river population that was smaller. It is hypothesised that reduction in size of Western Australian G. maculatus generally is an adaptive response to avoid predation by piscivorous birds in shallow, confined river pools and lakes.

There was a well defined, albeit extended, breeding season between autumn and spring with peak spawning in winter. The season was longer in the relatively stable lake situation and shorter ~ the very variable river situation partly due to the influence of river flow, which is continuous into the lake and intermittent and variable in the rivers.  A flow dependent upstream spawning migration was part of the reproductive strategy but there was also the capacity, in certain circumstances, of spawning on falling water levels in years of nil or little flow.

There was an almost complete cessation of reproductive activity during summer.  Fecundity ranged from 296-2 874 eggs with a mean of 912 and was positively correlated with total length. The overall total lengths at which 50% of females and males and attain sexual maturity were estimated at 52 and 49 mm total length,  respectively. For 95% of females and males the total lengths were estimated at 74 and 62mm total length, respectively.

Ageing by counting annual growth rings was successful for lake inhabiting fish only, the lack of consistency in growth rings in the river environments was attributed to the extreme variability of these environments. The von Bertalanffy growth equation predicted that, on average, at the end of their first, second and third years females were 61, 81 and 88 mm total length respectively. Male predictions were 56, 74 and 80 mm,  respectively. Approximately 75% of males and 62% of females attained sexual maturity at the end of their first year. Excluding larval fish, 73.1, 22.7, 4.1 and 0.1 % were 0+, 1+, 2+ and 3+ fish, respectively. The overall sex ratio females:males was 1.09:1.0, the ratio favoured males for very small fish but favoured females as fish aged and grew.

Larval development was described in detail for the first time for Australian G.  maculatus. The sequence of fin development was the same as that reported for galaxiids elsewhere, i.e. caudal, dorsal, anal, pectoral and pelvic. Adult fin ray counts were; cauda1 16, dorsa1 9, anal 13, pectoral 12 and pelvic 6-7. Myomeres ranged from 45-50.  Development of pigmentation and dentition were described; caniniform teeth began to develop during the late postflexion larval stage.

Dietary analysis confirmed a previous description of G. maculatus as an euryphagic carnivore. A wide range of invertebrate food groups including copepods, amphipods and ostracods, aquatic insects as well as terrestrial invertebrates (spiders, winged ants and orthopterans) were consumed. Most variation in diet was explained by site, i.e whether fish were from river or lake environments or which river environment. A lack of replicate samples precluded a rigorous statistical analysis of the influence of either fish size or season on diet. However, a provisional analysis suggested these variables have minimal influence. Larval diets comprised copepods, cladocerans and unicellular algae; with the attainment of postflexion larval stage and development of caniniform dentition, a wider range of dietary items were ingested.

One cestode, one trematode and two nematode larval worms infected river and lake inhabiting fish. The cestode, Ligula intestinalis, infected 13% of lake inhabiting fish causing gross disfiguration and probably reduced reproductive success, particularly of males. The degree and severity of cestode infection was much less in rivers, perhaps due to their saline waters. The worms' adult hosts in all cases were piscivorous waterfowl particularly the white-faced heron.

At present G. maculatus is widespread and abundant throughout its range in Western Australia. As most of its range is in rivers and lakes which are, and will in the future be influenced by clearing for agriculture, it is likely that increased river recharge due to clearing will initially benefit G. maculatus. However long term change, particularly changes to riparian vegetation structure and species composition, are likely eventually to be inimical as the shading value of vegetation and its habitat value for terrestrial invertebrate food are diminished.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spotted Minnow</field><field name="subject">Galaxias maculatus</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041029.92331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial CaCO3 precipitation for the production of biocement</field><field name="creator">vicky.whiffin@sydneywater.com.au</field><field name="description">The hydrolysis of urea by the widely distributed enzyme urease is special in that it is one of the few biologically occurring reactions that can generate carbonate ions without an associated production of protons. When this hydrolysis occurs in a calcium-rich environment, calcite (calcium carbonate) precipitates from solution forming a solid-crystalline material. The binding strength of the precipitated crystals is highly dependent on the rate of carbonate formation and under suitable conditions it is possible to control the reaction to generate hard binding calcite cement (or Biocement). The objective of this thesis was to develop an industrially suitable cost-effective microbial process for the production of urease active cells and investigate the potential for urease active cells to act as a catalyst for the production of Biocement.

The biocementation capability of two suitable strains was compared. Sporosarcina pasteurii (formally Bacillus pasteurii) produced significantly higher levels of urease activity compared to Proteus vulgaris, however the level of urease activity was variable with respect to biomass suggesting that the enzyme was not constitutive as indicated by the literature, but subject to regulation. The environmental and physiological conditions for maximum urease activity in S. pasteurii were investigated and it was found that the potential urease capacity of the organism was very high (29 mM urea.min-1.OD-1) and sufficient for biocementation without additional processing (e.g. concentration, cell lysis). The regulation mechanism for S. pasteurii urease was not fully elucidated in this study, however it was shown that low specific urease activity was not due to depletion of urea nor due to the high concentrations of the main reaction product, ammonium. pH conditions were shown to have a regulatory effect on urease but it was evident that another co-regulating mechanism existed. Despite not fully exploiting the urease capability of S. pasteurii, sufficient urease activity to allow direct application of the enzyme without additional processing could still be achieved and the organism was considered suitable for biocementation.

Urease was the most expensive component of the cementation process and cost-efficient production was desired, thus an economic growth procedure was developed for large-scale cultivation of S. pasteurii. The organism is a moderate alkaliphile (growth optimum pH 9.25) and it was shown that sufficient activity for biocementation could be cultivated in non-sterile conditions with a minimum of upstream and downstream processing. The cultivation medium was economised and expensive components were replace with a food-grade protein source and acetate, which lowered production costs by 95%. A high level of urease activity (21 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1) was produced in the new medium at a low cost ($0.20 (AUD) per L).

The performance of urease in whole S. pasteurii cells was evaluated under biocementation conditions (i.e. presence of high concentrations of urea, Ca2+, NH4 +/NH3, NO3 - and Cl- ions). It was established that the rate of urea hydrolysis was not constant during cementation, but largely controlled by the external concentrations of urea and calcium, which constantly changed during cementation due to precipitation of solid calcium carbonate from the system. A simple model was generated that predicted the change in urea hydrolysis rate over the course of cementation. It was shown that whole cell S. pasteurii urease was tolerant to concentrations of up to 3 M urea and 2 M calcium, and the rate of urea hydrolysis was unaffected up to by 3 M ammonium. This allowed the controlled precipitation of up to 1.5 M CaCO3 within one treatment, and indicated that the enzyme was very stable inspite of extreme chemical conditions.

A cost-efficient cementation procedure for the production of high cementation strength was developed. Several biocementation trials were conducted into order to optimise the imparted cementation strength by determining the effect of urea hydrolysis rate on the development of strength. It was shown that high cementation strength was produced at low urea hydrolysis rates and that the development of cementation strength was not linear over the course of the reaction but mostly occurred in the first few hours of the reaction. In addition, the whole cell bacterial enzyme had capacity to be immobilised in the cementation material and re-used to subsequent applications, offering a significant cost-saving to the process.

An industry-sponsored trial was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of Biocement for increasing in-situ strength and stiffness of two different sandy soils; (a) Koolschijn sand and (b) 90% Koolschijn sand mixed with 10% peat (Holland Veen). After biocementation treatment, Koolschijn sand indicated a shear strength of 1.8 MPa and a stiffness of 250 MPa, which represents an 8-fold and 3-fold respective improvement in strength compared to unconsolidated sand. Significantly lower strength improvements were observed in sand mixed with peat.

In combination, trials of producing bacteria under economically acceptable conditions and cementation trials support the possibility of on-site production and in-situ application of large field applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urease</field><field name="subject">calcium</field><field name="subject">carbonate precipitation</field><field name="subject">bacteria.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041101.142604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fulfilment of doom? : the dialogic interaction between the Book of Lamentations and the pre-exilic/early exilic prophetic literature</field><field name="creator">eboase@nd.edu.au</field><field name="description">It has long been noted that the book of Lamentations shares, at least in part, a theological outlook with the prophetic literature that the destruction of Jerusalem was the result of Yahweh&#146;s decisive action against the sins of the nation.  Too often, however, this relationship has simply been presupposed, or assumed to be a relationship of shared perspective.  To date there has been no systematic exploration of how it is that Lamentations accepts and/or modifies the theological outlook of the prophetic literature.  In addition, when the theology of the prophets has been discussed in relation to Lamentations, there has been a tendency to group all the prophetic books together as if they existed as a homogeneous whole, and shared amongst themselves a singular outlook.  This tendency to simplify the theological complexity of the prophetic literature coincides with a similar tendency to reduce the theology of Lamentations to simple, monolithic assertions.  Drawing on the literary insights of Mikhail Bakhtin, this study aims to explore in detail the nature of the relationship between Lamentations and the pre-exilic/exilic prophetic literature.  Drawing on notions of dialogism, Polyphony and double voicing, the study argues that Lamentations enters i8nto a dialogic relationship with the prophetic literature, a relationship that both affirms and subverts that literature.  Central to the acknowledgement of the dialogic interaction between Lamentations and the prophetic literature is the recognition of Lamentations as a multivalent, polyphonic text in which unmerged viewpoints exist in a tension filled relationship.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">Old Testament</field><field name="subject">Prophets</field><field name="subject">Lamentations</field><field name="subject">Judaism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041102.124257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping Fire Affected Areas in Northern Western Australia: Towards an Automatic Approach</field><field name="creator">kcandy@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Wildfires across northern Australia are a growing problem with more than 2.5 million hectares being burnt each year. Accordingly, remote sensing has been used as a tool to routinely monitor and map fire histories. In northern Western Australia, the Department of Land Information Satellite Remote Sensing Services (DLI SRSS) has been responsible for providing and interpreting NOAA-AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. SRSS staff utilise this data to automatically map hotspots on a daily basis, and manually map fire affected areas (FAA) every nine days. This information is then passed on to land managers to enhance their ability to manage the effects of fire and assess its impact over time.

The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for the near real-time automatic mapping of FAA in the Kimberley and Pilbara as an alternative to the currently used semimanual approach. Daily measures of temperature, surface reflectance and vegetation indices from twenty nine NOAA-16 (2001) passes were investigated. It was firstly necessary to apply atmospheric and BRDF corrections to the raw reflectance data to account for the variation caused by changing viewing and illumination geometry over a cycle.

Findings from the four case studies indicate that case studies 1 and 2 exhibited a typical fire response (visible and near-infrared channels and vegetation indices decreased), whereas 3 and 4 displayed an atypical response (visible channel increased while the near-infrared channel and vegetation indices decreased). Alternative vegetation indices such as GEMI, GEMI3 and VI3 outperformed NDVI in some cases. Likewise atmospheric and BRDF corrected NDVI provided better performance in separating burnt and unburnt classes.

The difficulties in quantifying FAA due to temporal and spatial variation result from numerous factors including vegetation type, fire intensity, rate of ash and charcoal dispersal due to wind and rain, background soil influence and rate of revegetation. In this study two different spectral responses were recorded, indicating the need to set at least two sets of thresholds in an automated or semi-automated classification algorithm. It also highlighted the necessity of atmospheric and BRDF corrections.

It is therefore recommended that future research apply atmospheric and BRDF corrections at the pre-processing stage prior to analysis when utilising a temporal series of NOAAAVHRR data. Secondly, it is necessary to investigate additional FAA within the four biogeographic regions to enable thresholds to be set in order to develop an algorithm. This algorithm must take into account the variation in a fire&#146;s spectral response which may result from fire intensity, vegetation type, background soil influence or climatic factors.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NOAA-AVHRR</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041104.103920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our Daily Bread: The Field Bakery &amp; the Anzac Legend</field><field name="creator">petcell@arach.net.au</field><field name="description">The First World War and the Australian Imperial Force have generated thousands of books and articles.

Some historians have acknowledged that a particular group of non-fighting combatants has been neglected, but generally, this group has been employed in dangerous and difficult pursuits. Very few historians have studied the roles of non-fighting combatants whose contribution is considered as lacklustre, such as the Australian Field Bakeries. 

When I began my research, I could not understand why the Australian Field Bakeries did not play any part in the historiography of World War One. An examination of the Anzac legend revealed an emphasis on the characteristics of the Anzac, especially masculinity and heroism. I argue that the bakers&#146; employment might be considered as being situated within the woman&#146;s sphere and therefore unmasculine, whilst that same employment did not offer the chance for acts of heroism. Because of an emphasis on the exciting exploits of the infantry within Anzac historiography, the Australian Field Bakeries and their role as support troops have been ignored and omitted.

Comparing demographic statistics and the war experiences, values and attitudes of the Australian Imperial Force and the bakers, I conclude that the bakers of the Australian Field Bakeries were extraordinarily similar to the men of the Australian Imperial Force. Only those experiences and statistics directly related to the two groups&#146; specific fields of employment are significantly different. I argue that specialised skills and a perceived lack of masculinity and heroism have seen the men of the Australian Field Bakeries excluded from all existing Anzac historiography.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anzac</field><field name="subject">AIF</field><field name="subject">Australian Imperial Force</field><field name="subject">WWI</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">support services</field><field name="subject">field bakeries</field><field name="subject">Gallipoli</field><field name="subject">Western Front</field><field name="subject">Bean</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041107.152144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Human Resource Management Practices on the Retention of Core Employees of Australian Organisations: An Empirical Study</field><field name="creator">Janet.Chew@cbs.curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">Employee retention is one of the challenges facing many business organisations today. For many organisations, strategic staffing has become a concern because the ability to hold on to highly talented core employees can be crucial to future survival. This empirical study examined the current human resource management (HRM) practices of Australian organisations in the retention of their core employees. In particular, the research identified the core elements of HRM practices, which strongly influence the decision for core employees to stay. 

The study comprise three phases: (1) a preliminary investigation, utilising the Delphi Technique to obtain the opinions of an expert panel of thirteen, (2) in-depth interviews, involving twelve human resource managers of Australian organisations and (3) a quantitative survey of 800 employees from nine Australian organisations. 

The findings revealed greater insights into the HRM-retention relationship and provided empirical validation of the relationship. More specifically, the research identified eight retention factors that influence the decision of core employees to stay. These specific factors consisted of two bundles of practices: HR factors (e.g., person organisational fit, remuneration, reward and recognition, training and career development, challenging job opportunities) and Organisational factors (e.g., leadership behaviour, company culture and policies, teamwork relationship and satisfactory work environment). The outcome of the HRM-retention relationship was examined through organisational commitment and turnover intention using multiple regression analysis. 

The findings of this study revealed positive significant co-relationships between the eight factors and organisational commitment.  Moreover, it was highlighted that commitment acted as a partial mediator of remuneration, recognition and reward, training and career development and work environment on intent to stay. Commitment fully mediated the relationship person organisational fit, teamwork relationship, culture and policies and intention to stay.

The study produced a model suitable for use by human resource practitioners as a guide in determining what initiatives an organisation should adopt to retain their critical employees. 

This research has also made a contribution by illuminating the current employment relationships in Australian organisations and providing relevant empirical evidence to support the theoretical model of Human Resource Architecture, developed by Lepak and Snell (1999) and, as a result, creating a configuration for an Australian Human Resource Architecture model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retention</field><field name="subject">core employees</field><field name="subject">organizational commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041201.150257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing Models of Collaboration among High School Science Teachers in an Electronic Environment</field><field name="creator">Punipa91@Hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Teacher collaboration is one of the strategies for encouraging teaches to work together to achieve their common ends. In a complex modern world, teachers rarely have time to collaborate with each other. E-mail and Internet technology encourages teacher collaboration to emerge with personal interaction. E-mail is rapid, permitting responses within the same day or even a few hours. On the network, teachers can seek advice from teachers on other campuses and around the world, and at the same time, they can build their relationship with other users. In Western Australia, an e-mail network for science curriculum leaders was established in both primary and secondary schools. In 1998, a study showed that 93 heads of science departments in government high schools were connected to this e-mail network, and more than two-thirds of them had their computers connected to the World Wide Web. 

This study aims to: firstly, test Fishbough&#146;s models of collaboration among high school science teachers in an electronic environment (e-mail and Internet); and secondly, presents a detailed science web site analysis in terms of the potential of these websites to foster collaboration. The investigation is divided into two distinct studies: Study One is a survey of the teachers&#146; perceptions of collaboration via the Internet and Study Two is a detailed science website analysis.

Study One employed both mail questionnaire and face-to-face interview techniques as methods of data collection. The Science Teacher Collaboration via E-mail and Internet Questionnaire was developed and used to collect data on models of collaboration and interaction perspective of collaborative relationships via the Internet of science teachers at the selected schools. The information from quantitative analysis was used to compose the interview schedule. The follow-up interview was conducted with science teachers who agreed to be interviewed at the sample schools. 

Study Two adopted a content analysis technique for analysis of data collected from the two kinds of science websites, specific science websites for science teachers and science websites for general audiences from five chosen continents, Australia, Asia, Europe, America and Africa.     

The study found that the Consulting model of collaboration is frequently used by science teachers and science web sites from five chosen continents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041201.151300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidation of Refractory Gold Concentrates and Simultaneous Dissolution of Gold in Aerated Alkaline Solutions</field><field name="creator">Suchun@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The oxidation of refractory gold concentrates containing arsenopyrite and pyrite and the simultaneous dissolution of gold in aerated alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures without the addition of cyanide has been studied. It involves the following aspects: the chemistry of the oxidation of pure arsenopyrite and pyrite minerals in aerated alkaline solutions; the kinetics of oxidation of arsenopyrite and the simultaneous dissolution of gold in such solutions; the kinetics of simultaneous dissolution of gold during the alkaline oxidation of refractory gold concentrates; the electrochemistry of gold in alkaline solutions containing thiosulfate or monothioarsenate; the effect of copper on the leaching of gold in alkaline thiosulfate solutions; and the leaching of gold in alkaline solutions with thioarsenites.

The nature and proportions of the products of the oxidation of arsenopyrite in aerated alkaline solutions have been studied using high pressure ion chromatography techniques that have shown that thiosulfate and a new species, monothioarsenate, are the main oxidation products of arsenopyrite apart from arsenate and sulfite. The alkaline oxidation of pyrite primarily yields thiosulfate and sulfite. A kinetic investigation of the oxidation of arsenopyrite with air or oxygen has shown that the initial rate of arsenopyrite oxidation is proportional to the concentration of dissolved oxygen. A reaction mechanism for the oxidation of arsenopyrite has been proposed, which involves an anodic oxidation of the mineral involving hydroxyl ions coupled to a cathodic process for oxygen reduction which is partially controlled by mass transfer of dissolved oxygen to the mineral surface.

Detailed studies of the dissolution behaviour of gold in aerated alkaline solutions in the presence of thiosulfate or monothioarsenate by electrochemical and leaching methods have demonstrated that the dissolution rate is very low as compared to that of gold in alkaline cyanide or ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions. It has been found that copper ions catalyze the dissolution of gold in the thiosulfate solutions in the absence of ammonia. The leaching experiments also have shown that gold may dissolve in alkaline thioarsenite solutions, which provides a possible new process option for the leaching of gold.

The oxidation of refractory arsenical gold concentrates in aerated alkaline solutions results in the formation of thiosulfate, arsenate and sulfate as well as the dissolution of gold, copper and iron. It appears that the dissolution of gold is due to the complex reactions of gold with thiosulfate ions promoted by the catalytic effect of copper ions. Up to 80% of the gold may be extracted during the oxidation of selected refractory arsenical</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Arsenopyrite</field><field name="subject">Alkaline Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Thiosulfate</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041201.152201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Leadership in Computer-Mediated Collaborative Groups</field><field name="creator">sudweeks@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Computer-mediated collaboration is an important feature of modern organisational and educational settings. Despite its ever increasing popularity, it is still commonly compared unfavourably with face-to-face collaboration because non-verbal and paralinguistic cues are minimal. Although research on face-to-face group collaboration is well documented, less is known about computer-mediated collaboration.

The initial focus of this thesis was an in-depth analysis of a case study of a computer-mediated collaborative group. The case study was a large international group of volunteer researchers who collaborated on a two-year research project using asynchronous communication (email). This case study was a window on collaborative dialogue in the early 1990s (1992-94) at a time when information and communication technologies were at an early stage of development. 

After identifying the issues emerging from this early case study, another case study using technologies and virtual environments developed over the past decade, was designed to further understand how groups work together on a collaborative activity. The second case study was a small group of students enrolled in a unit of study at Murdoch University who collaborated on a series of nine online workshops using synchronous communication (chat room). This case study was a window on collaborative dialogue in the year 2000 when information and communication technologies had developed at a rate which few people envisioned in the early 90s.

The primary aim of the research described in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of how computer-mediated collaborative communities develop and grow. In particular, the thesis addresses questions related to the developmental and leadership characteristics of collaborative groups.

Internet research requires a set of assumptions relating to ontology, epistemology, human nature and methodological approach that differs from traditional research assumptions. A research framework for Internet research &#150; Complementary Explorative Data Analysis (CEDA) &#150; was therefore developed and applied to the two case studies. 

The results of the two case studies using the CEDA methodology indicate that computer-mediated collaborative groups are highly adaptive to the aim of the collaborative task to be completed, and the medium in which they collaborate. In the organisational setting, it has been found that virtual teams can devise and complete a collaborative task entirely online. It may be an advantage, but it is certainly not mandatory to have preliminary face-to-face discussions. What is more important is to ensure that time is allowed for an initial period of structuration which involves social interaction to develop a social presence and eventually cohesiveness. In the educational setting, a collaborative community increases pedagogical effectiveness. Providing collaborative projects and interdependent tasks promotes constructivist learning and a strong foundation for understanding how to collaborate in the global workplace. Again, this research has demonstrated that students can collaborate entirely online, although more pedagogical scaffolding may be required than in the organisational setting. The importance of initial social interaction to foster a sense of presence and community in a mediated environment has also been highlighted.

This research also provided greater understanding of emergent leadership in computer-mediated collaborative groups. It was found that sheer volume of words does not make a leader but frequent messages with topic-related content does contribute to leadership qualities.

The results described in this thesis have practical implications for managers of virtual teams and educators in e-learning.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-mediated groups</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">group development</field><field name="subject">cohesion</field><field name="subject">CEDA</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041206.122548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of Sudden Death in Cultivated Proteas from the Southwest of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Christopher Philip Dunne</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands is a common and devastating pathogen of cultivated proteas worldwide.  Webb (1997) described a Sudden Death plant disease of proteas in Western Australia (WA) protea plantations.  Proteas that suffer the syndrome display symptoms such as stunted growth, wilting, chlorosis and often death.  In the current study, a number of protea plantations in the southwest of WA were visited to quantify the extent that P. cinnamomi was attributing to deaths of cultivated proteas.  The survey indicated that P. cinnamomi is the major cause of Sudden Death in proteas.  A range of other fungi (Fusarium, Botryosphaeria, Pestalotiopsis, Alternaria) and pests (nematodes, mealy bug, scale insects) were also identified to be contributing to protea death and decline in WA plantations.  In many cases the factors contributing to protea disease appeared complex, with a range of physical factors or nutritional imbalances commonly associated with these pathogens and pests.  As P. cinnamomi was the major cause of death of cultivated proteas the remainder of the experiments described in this dissertation investigated its control in horticultural plantings.  

Biofumigation has the potential to become an important technique in an overall integrated management approach to P. cinnamomi.  In this thesis, biofumigation refers to the suppression of pathogens and pests by the incorporation of Brassica plants into the soil.  Two biofumigants (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern., B. napus L.) were screened for their effect on the in vitro growth of five common Phytophthora species (P. cinnamomi, P. cactorum (Lebert &amp; Colin) Schroeter., P. citricola Sawada, P. cryptogea Pethyb. &amp; Laff. and P. megasperma Drechsler).  Growth was determined by the measuring dry weight and radial growth of vegetative hyphae.  B. juncea was found to be superior in its suppressive effect compared to B. napus.  There was also significant variation in the sensitivity of the Phytophthora species to the suppressive effects of the biofumigants.  P. cinnamomi was the most sensitive of the five species investigated.  Where the rates of the biofumigant were sufficient to suppress growth of Phytophthora, the suppressive effect was mostly fungicidal. 

To determine how B. juncea and B. napus affect the infective ability and survival of  P. cinnamomi, their effects on sporangia and chlamydospores production in soil was investigated in vitro.  P. cinnamomi colonised Miracloth discs were added to soil amended with the two Brassica species, before being removed every two days over an eight day period for the determination of sporangia production, chlamydospore production and infective ability.  Only the soils amended with B. juncea significantly reduced sporangia production in P. cinnamomi.  Both Brassica species increased the percentage of aborted or immature sporangia and reduced the infective ability of the pathogen.  Neither Brassica species had any effect on zoospore release or chlamydospore production in P. cinnamomi.  

Soil cores and soil leachate were collected from biofumigant-amended field soils to determine the inoculum potential and infective ability of the pathogen under glasshouse conditions.  Amending the soil with both Brassica species had an immediate suppressive effect on the inoculum potential and infective ability of the P. cinnamomi.  However, after this initial suppression there was a gradual increase in the recovery of the pathogen over the monitoring period of four weeks.  To determine if the suppression would result in decreased disease incidence in a susceptible host, Lupinus angustifolius L. seeds were planted in the biofumigant amended soil.   B. juncea amended soils reduced the disease incidence of P. cinnamomi by 25%.  B. napus had no effect on disease incidence in L. angustifolius.

Although the current study had demonstrated that biofumigants could suppress the growth, sporulation and infection of P. cinnamomi, it was unclear if this would equate to a reduction in disease incidence when applied in the field.  A field trial was conducted on a protea plantation in the southwest of Western Australia that compared biofumigation with B. juncea to chemical fumigation (metham sodium) and soil solarisation.  The three soil treatments were used in an integrated management approach to control P. cinnamomi that included the use of a hardwood compost, mulch and water sterilisation.  All treatments were monitored during their application to ensure the treatments were conducted successfully.  The three soil treatments significantly reduced the recovery of the pathogen and the infective ability of the pathogen to a soil depth of 20 cm.  Metham sodium was the most suppressive soil treatment and soil solarisation was the least suppressive treatment.  Only the metham sodium treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of root rot in Leucadendron salignum P.J. Bergius x laureolum (Lam.) Fourc (c.v. Safari Sunset) over the monitoring period of three years.  

Another field trial was conducted on the same protea plantation to compare the effectiveness of B. juncea and B. napus, without the use of other control strategies, to reduce the incidence of P. cinnamomi infection of Leucadendron Safari Sunset.  The concentration of isothiocyanates was monitored for seven days after the incorporation of the biofumigants.  Although both Brassica species reduced the recovery and infective ability of the pathogen, neither biofumigant reduced the incidence of root rot in Leucadendron Safari Sunset.

In conclusion, P. cinnamomi is the most common and devastating pathogen in WA protea plantations.  The current study demonstrated that P. cinnamomi is sensitive to the suppressive nature of biofumigants. Biofumigants can suppress the in vitro growth, sporulation, infective ability of P. cinnamomi and reduce the incidence of the disease caused by the pathogen in the glasshouse.  Of the two Brassica species investigated,  B. juncea was superior in its ability to control P. cinnamomi compared to B. napus.  When applied in the field, biofumigation using B. juncea was found to be more suppressive that soil solarisation, but not as effective as metham sodium.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protea</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041207.140807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Breeding Biology of the Flesh-footed Shearwater  Puffinus carneipes.</field><field name="creator">petrelhead@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The Flesh-footed Shearwater Puffinus carneipes, a 625g (&#177; 3) shearwater, was studied on Woody Island, off the southern coast of Western Australia, from 2000 to 2003, mainly during the chick-rearing phase.  Flesh-footed Shearwaters arrive back at their breeding colony at the end of September/early October, dig burrows and court in October, before an unsynchronised pre-laying exodus through November.  Eggs are laid in the last week of November, incubated in December and January, and then hatch mid- to late-January.  The fledglings depart in late-April/early-May.  

Most nesting burrows were located in areas where soil depth was greater than 350mm (&#177; 14), and were angled into a slope so that the average length was about 1050mm  (&#177; 16) long.  Burrow activity, monitored with knock-down barricades, peaked around 83-86% of burrows visited nightly in late-October/early-November.  Nightly visitation of burrows fell to 8-10% in the third week of November (the pre-laying exodus), and then rose rapidly to around 70% through late-November/early-December as laying commenced.  Body mass was high 632g (&#177; 5) during courtship, fell just before the exodus 606g (&#177; 6), then rose again 620g (&#177; 11) upon return.  

Parents incubate their egg alternately, each undertaking a shift of one to eight days.  A few days after hatching, the nestling is left unattended by day in the burrow, where it receives a meal weighing 13-18% adult body mass every 1.4 nights, on average, during the 101 days (&#177; 1) it spends there.  Flesh-footed Shearwaters are strictly nocturnal visitors to their colony, although nightly proportions of nests entered were not adversely influenced by bright moonlight, climatic or oceanographic conditions.  Initially, nestlings received small overnight feeds, but these increased in size and were delivered more frequently as nestlings grew.  In consequence, although mean peak body masses attained by nestlings differed significantly between years, after an average period of 66 days (&#177; 2) in the nest young attained masses equivalent to 135-160% mean adult mass.  This coincided with deposits of body fat, but carcass analyses of nestlings revealed that a substantial proportion of mass accumulation was attributable to water, particularly as a component of body fat.  

Subsequently, nestlings lost 30-40% of their mass as the time of fledging approached, even though masses of food were generally no smaller, nor delivered any less frequently during this period.  Mass recession occurred primarily as a result of water loss, mainly from the integument, but also, substantially from body fat.  This is consistent with the view that mass accumulation is related to feather growth.  Although the final body masses recorded differed between years, nestlings fledged at around 92-98% mean adult mass, even though they retained a store of body fat.  Nestlings continued to be fed to within one to two days prior to departure.  The exception was if the peak mass attained was only 800g or less.  Individuals in this low peak mass category lost a proportion of body mass similar to heavier chicks and therefore fledged correspondingly lighter than other fledglings.  

It is suggested that parent shearwaters &#147;over-feed&#148; their nestling so that the peak in body mass coincides with the period of maximum feather growth, and nestling obesity stems from both lipid and water accumulation.  The Flesh-footed Shearwater nestling attains a high level of obesity, even though it is fed large meals almost nightly throughout its life ashore, even in poor years.  This lends little support to those explanations for nestling obesity in shearwaters that are based upon buffering the young against erratic feeding schedules and long intervals between meals.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041216.115345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing from the Shadowlands: How Cross-Cultural Literature Negotiates the Legacy of Edward Said</field><field name="creator">t.tansley@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of Edward Said&#146;s influential work Orientalism and its legacy in respect of contemporary reading and writing across cultures. It also questions the legitimacy of Said&#146;s retrospective stereotyping of early examples of cross-cultural representation in literature as uncompromisingly &#147;orientalist&#148;.

It is well known that the release of Edward Said&#146;s Orientalism in 1978 was responsible for the rise of a range of cultural and critical theories from multiculturalism to postcolonialism. It was a study that not only polarized critics and forced scholars to re-examine orientalist archives, but persuaded creative writers to re-think their ethnographic positions when it came to the literary representations of cultures other than their own. Without detracting from the enormous impact of Said, this thesis isolates gaps and silences in Said that need correcting. Furthermore, there is an element of intransigence, an uncompromising refusal to fine-tune what is essentially a binary discourse of the West and its other in Said&#146;s work, that encourages the continued interrogation of power relations but which, because of its very boldness, paradoxically disallows the extent to which the conflict of cultures indeed produced new, hybrid social and cultural formations. 

In an attempt to challenge the severity of Said&#146;s claim that &#147;every European, in what he could say about the Orient, was consequently a racist, an imperialist, and almost totally ethnocentric&#148;, the thesis examines a number of different discursive contexts in which such a presumption is challenged. Thus while the second chapter discusses the &#145;traditional&#146; profession-based orientalism of nineteenth-century E. G. Browne, the third considers the anti-imperialism of colonial administrator Leonard Woolf. The fourth chapter provides a reflection on the difficulties of diasporic &#147;orientalism&#148; through the works of Michael Ondaatje while chapter five demonstrates the effects of the dialogism used by Amitav Ghosh as a defence against &#147;orientalism&#148;. The thesis concludes with an examination of contemporary writing by Andrea Levy that appositely illustrates the legacy of Said&#146;s influence.

While the restrictive parameters of Said&#146;s work make it difficult to mount a thorough-going critique of Said, this thesis shows that, indeed, it is within the restraints of these parameters and in the very discourse that Said employs that he traps himself. This study claims that even Said is susceptible to &#147;orientalist&#148; criticism in that he is as much an &#147;orientalist&#148; as those at whom he directs his polemic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">post-colonialism</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">literary theory</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041221.112154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mad Science: Discourses of &#145;Schizophrenia&#146; and &#145;Therapy&#146; for Hearing Voices</field><field name="creator">mwise@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">People who are diagnosed with &#145;severe mental illness&#146; experience some of the most extreme and pervasive prejudice of all groups in Western society. How can this still be so? Although the term &#145;mental illness&#146; is typically reserved for the most &#145;serious&#146; of &#145;cases&#146;, psychiatry&#146;s medical model is expanding into increasingly everyday realms. Thus, in concert with efforts to reduce social stigma, &#145;mental illness&#146; is becoming &#145;normal&#146;. Nevertheless, &#145;abnormality&#146; is a requirement of biopsychiatry and its offshoots; professionals require some &#145;thing&#146; to remedy. How do &#145;clinical&#146; professionals manage these tensions? And what alternatives are there to the pathologizing of such phenomena? 

Such concerns are considered in relation to my main thesis question: How do professionals represent &#145;schizophrenia&#146; and hearing voices in theoretical texts, and how is that played out in the minutiae of therapy practices? Drawing on discourse analysis and conversation analysis, I critique professional categorizations of what are typically known as &#145;schizophrenia&#146;, &#145;mental illness&#146;, &#145;patients&#146;, &#145;clients&#146;, and &#145;therapists&#146;. My case in point is the experience of hearing voices - pathologically known as &#145;auditory hallucinations&#146;. &#145;Delusional&#146; beliefs are also considered.

In Part 1, accounts of voices as supernatural or ordinary phenomena, or as a &#145;symptom&#146; of &#145;severe mental illness&#146;, are considered. Mainstream psychiatric and psychological texts are analyzed and critical alternatives are summarized. 

In Part 2, a selection of studies of interactions involving &#145;severe mental illness&#146; are reviewed and ongoing analytic/methodological debates are discussed. A cognitivebehavioural therapy group for hearing distressing voices then provides data from &#145;clinical&#146; talk-in-interaction for analysis. I focus on negotiations of &#145;reality&#146; (the ordinary versus the psychiatric) and on what I take to be sanist prejudice-in-action. 

Part 3 relates findings from Part 2 to the context and findings of Part 1. There is also discussion of the positive implications of a more social and dialogical approach to understanding and otherwise dealing with the phenomena in question; for voice hearers, &#145;schizophrenics&#146;, and society at large.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">therapy</field><field name="subject">hearing voices</field><field name="subject">CBT</field><field name="subject">cognitive behavioural therapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041221.95451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convergent Close-Coupling Calculations of Positron-Helium Collisions</field><field name="creator">Huayou Wu</field><field name="description">The Convergent Close Coupling (CCC) method is applied, for the first time, to the scattering of positrons on helium. The helium target wave functions are obtained within various configuration interaction (CI) expansions. In the full CI expansion the two electrons are treated equally and thus all electron-electron correlations are taken into account. In the frozen-core (FC) approximation the CI expansion fixes one of the electrons to be described by a pure 1s orbital of He+, while maintaining the required singlet and triplet symmetries. Lastly, the multi-configuration (MC) approximation relaxes the FC approximation to allow the description of the inner electron to include several low-lying orbitals and is therefore more accurate than the FC approximation. The accuracy of the target wave functions is tested by comparing the calculated energy levels with the experimental data.

Based on positron-hydrogen scattering, comprehensive close-coupling formulas for positron-helium scattering are developed. The reduced two-centre V-matrix elements are derived in momentum space for various channels. These include direct, excitation and rearrangement channels, i.e. positronium formation.

We first consider low energy positron-helium elastic scattering for energies below the positronium formation threshold of 17.8 eV. Utilizing a single-centre expansion the elastic cross section and phase shifts have been calculated as a function of the positron incident energy. The calculations agree very well with the experimental data and the variational calculations, but not previous single- or double-centre close-coupling calculations.

We then consider energies above the first ionization threshold (24.6 eV) and calculate helium elastic, excitation, fragmentation and total cross sections within the single-centre expansion approach. Good agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical results has been obtained.

The studies have proved that a single-centre expansion, with accurate target state description, can deliver accurate data of practical value over a broad range of energies. However in the low-energy region, between the positronium formation threshold of 17.8 eV and the ionization threshold of 24.6 eV, implementation of the two-centre expansion is required. We expect this work to be undertaken in the near future, based on the derivations presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Positron-Helium Collisions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050107.101745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the benzimidazole-binding site on the cytoskeletal protein tubulin</field><field name="creator">Louisa M. MacDonald</field><field name="description">The binding kinetics of several benzimidazole compounds were determined with recombinant tubulin monomers and heterodimers from benzimidazole-sensitive and -insensitive organisms. This study utilised the naturally occurring high efficacy of the benzimdazoles for the parasitic protozoa Giardia duodenalis and Encephalitozoon intestinalis. The benzimidazoles are not active against the protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum or mammalian hosts, including humans. The affinity of several benzimidazole derivatives for monomeric and heterodimeric &#226;-tubulin was clearly demonstrated, thus supporting previous studies of drug-resistant nematode and fungal populations. A homology model of protozoan &#225;&#226;-tubulin, produced using the three-dimensionalstructure of mammalian &#225;&#226;-tubulin, identified a strongly hydrophobic domain only on the &#226;-tubulin protein of sensitive protozoa. This domain is proposed to be the benzimidazole-binding domain and the amino acid residues within it include three key residues which are substituted between benzimidazole-sensitive and &#150;insensitive organisms. These residues are Ile-189, Val-199, and Phe-200 that all have non-polar, hydrophobic side groups and are proposed to bind with the R5 side chain of several benzimidazole derivatives. In addition to this, the benzimidazole derivatives were able to bind irreversibly with assembling microtubules from sensitive parasites. The incorporation of benzimidazole-bound &#225;&#226;-heterodimers into assembling microtubules was shown to arrest polymerisation in vitro although the addition of benzimidazole compounds to assembled microtubules did not result in depolymerisation. Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism of action of these compounds is through disruption of the dynamic equilibrium that balances the cycle of microtubule polymerisation and disintegration within these protozoa. Further, this effect is brought about by preferential binding of the benzimidazoles to a hydrophobic region on the &#226;- tubulin protein.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytoskeletal protein</field><field name="subject">Tubulin</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050107.94048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moorditj Magic: The story of Jim and Phillip Karkouer</field><field name="creator">s.gorman@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses and investigates the issue of racism in the football code of Australian Rules to understand how racism is manifested in Australian daily life.

These social issues are explored through the genre of biography and the story of the Noongar footballers, Jim and Phillip Krakouer, who played for Claremont and North Melbourne in the late 1970&#146;s and 1980&#146;s.

This thesis contests this assertion by showing that women workers&#146; ability to form enterprise unions in the Philippine garments industry are enhanced by transnational production arrangements involving an overseas market.  Specifically, the thesis demonstrates that, in order to meet the quality and delivery requirements of overseas buyers and contractors, local owners and/or production managers are forced to routinely keep more production in-house in order to exert more direct controls over the work processes of their women sewers.  By thereby limiting the amount of local subcontracting which is done, women workers are agglomerated in larger numbers in the one place and, consequently, their capacities to engage in collective action &#150; as indicated by the establishment of enterprise unions &#150; is markedly increased.

	Empirically, the argument of the thesis draws on a &#145;multiple-case&#146; study of sixty-five garment-making establishments located in and around Manila.  The study involved interviews with owners, production managers and/or trade union officials about the local subcontracting practices of their establishments.  The conclusions drawn about the links between export production and enhanced labour organising capacities at the enterprise level are corroborated by the &#145;commodity chain&#146; literature on industrial deepening in the international garments industry and the status of the Philippine industry in this regard.  But rather than think simply in terms of industrial deepening, this thesis is concerned with the impacts of exporting on class processes. 

	Theoretically, the thesis thus draws on the Marxist view that capitalist development entails changes in the social form of labour, through the real subsumption of labour.  But, whereas Marx linked the real subsumption of labour to greater capitalist controls over the labour process, in this thesis the real subsumption of labour is also tied to concomitant changes in the spatial form of the labour process. From this standpoint, the thesis engages with labour process theory after Braverman (accusing it of often failing to link capitalist control to class processes) and with theories of class (which often ignore the social and spatial form of the labour process). In tying organising capacities of women workers at the enterprise level to changes in social and spatial form of the labour process, it is nevertheless argued that these capacities are also shaped at the national level by the legal framework for legitimate organising and by &#145;political space&#146; in which the law in fact operates.   In this regard, it is argued that, whilst the state often passes laws to protect labour standards, it does not grant workers the means to ensure such standards are actually enforced. 

	The thesis also challenges the view that the recruitment of women is a strategy which employers deliberately use in the Philippine garments industry to limit industrial conflict.  Against this assertion of a rational economic basis to women&#146;s employment, the thesis argues that women are employed for sewing jobs as a result of the sex-typing of such jobs; but that this is also more an effect than a cause as the feminisation of sewing in the modern garments industry is embedded in class processes in the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States.  Gender is a dimension of labour control, but women workers in the garments industry are not employed to limit enterprise unionism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labour unions</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">garments industry</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050201.155254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Exercise Physiology of the Racing Greyhound</field><field name="creator">Ross Staaden</field><field name="description">Greyhounds were trained to gallop at maximal running speed on a treadmill constructed for the purpose. This speed considerably exceeded maximal aerobic speed and was termed supramaximal.

A mask was used to collect expired gases into bags during runs of 7.5 to 60 seconds and over the first 8-10 minutes of the recovery period. Respiratory parameters measured included VE, V02' VC02', R, fR', VT' ventilatory equivalent of &#176;2 uptake and ventilatory equivalent of CO2 production. Respiration was found to be synchronised with the gallop stride, enabling both a high fR and VT. Mean VE reached 6 1.kg-1.min-1. Mean V02 reached 143ml.kg-l.min-l during the 30-45 second segment of running. Lactic acid draining into the blood stream displaced CO2 from the bicarbonate buffer system, so that R rose above 1.0. The highest value of R, 2.3 occurred in the second minute of recovery.

The alactacid debt of the greyhound was found to be higher than that of man but was repaid much more rapidly because of the greyhound's superior oxygen transport system. 

The cardiovascular system was studied using electromagnetic and thermodilution flowmeters, and a heart rate telemeter. Changes in blood pressure caused changes in the relationship of the very elastic aortic root and the electromagnetic transducer cuff so that accurate calibration was not possible. Reliable values of cardiac output were obtained by thermodilution. Parameters measured included HR, cardiac output, SV and PCV taken before, during and for 1 hour after running. The minimum HR whilst sleeping was also obtained, and averaged 42 b min .-1  The HR was highest during runs of 30 seconds, 318 plus/minus18 b min -1. After running it fell sharply to below 160 in the second minute of recovery then rose to 200b.min-l 10 minutes after 30 and 45 second runs. HR was close to resting levels 1 hour after running. PCV after 30 seconds of running was 63.5 + 2.1% and had returned to resting values by 1 hour. Cardiac output during high speed runs was 914 + 209ml.kg-l.min-l while SV at 2.9 + 0.6ml. kg-l was increased 32% above resting SV.

Acid-base balance of jugular venous blood was studied. Comparisons with arterial samples taken at the same time showed a useful relationship of arterial and jugular venous blood for lactate, base excess and pH. The time taken for blood lactate to reach its peak value varied with the intensity and the duration of the run. The jugular venous blood lactate level after 45 of running peaked at 181 plus or minus l5mg.dl-l (7 minutes after seconds running) , pH fell to 7.094 plus or minus 0.27, base excess to -23.4 plus or minus 2.7 mEq.l-l and PC02 to 23 + 2 mm Hg. All values had returned to resting level 1 hour after the run.

Oxygen consumption during running, alactacid debt, lactate production and distance covered were used to calculate total energy cost and relative contributions of energy sources and energy cost.m -1. Anaerobic sources were the main contributors in the first 15 seconds but in the 15-30 second segment aerobic sources supplied 53% of the energy required and in the 30-45 second segment, 79%. The energy source contributions to30 seconds of running were aerobic 30%, alactacid debt 19% and lactic acid 51%. The energy cost.m-l at supramaximal speeds was higher than predicted by formulae derived from studies of dogs at submaximal speeds. The first 7.5 seconds of running cost almost as much as the next 22.5 seconds, indicating a high cost of acceleration. This is the first quantification of the energy cost of acceleration reported.

Compared to man, the greyhound has a very high oxygen uptake during sprinting. Man's major deficiencies as a sprinter are a low maximal heart rate, small heart relative to body size and low PCV. Sprinting impedes respiration in man but aids it in the greyhound. Calculations indicate that when man runs at supramaximal speed, it costs more per metre than predicted by formulae derived at submaximal speeds and that the energy cost of acceleration is of the same order as in the greyhound although man attains a much lower peak speed.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greyhounds</field><field name="subject">speed</field><field name="subject">respiration</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050203.142637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B Virus in Silvery Gibbons (Hylobates moloch)</field><field name="creator">karen.payne@perthzoo.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">This research investigated a number of issues regarding hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the silvery gibbon (Hylobates moloch). Due to the relatively recent discovery of the virus in nonhuman primate populations, specific knowledge of the biological behaviour of the virus is presently lacking, with current information largely extrapolated from the behaviour of HBV in human infections. In order to manage the captive and wild populations of this critically endangered species, information regarding the behaviour of the virus in gibbons and the likely impact of the viral infection is essential.

The research was performed at Perth Zoo, with the study population consisting of the current and historical members of the zoo&#146;s silvery gibbon colony. Because this gibbon species is critically endangered, the study was conducted with minimal intervention to the population with samples collected largely on an opportunistic basis from a small study population.

Review of the history of the virus within the Perth Zoo colony provided epidemiological evidence to indicate vertical transmission in three gibbons (Hecla, Uban and Jury). It would appear that vertical transmission is the primary mode of transmission leading to dispersal of the virus through the captive population of silvery gibbons.

Elevated concentrations of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were found in three gibbons (Perth 2, Uban and Jury), and may suggest a pathogenic role of the virus in this species. Histological examination of the livers of Uban and Perth 2 failed to demonstrate definitive evidence of cirrhosis, however mild fibrosis was seen in both cases and may represent an early stage of liver pathology associated with chronic hepatitis B infection.

The vaccination protocol developed at Perth Zoo was successful in preventing neonatal transmission of the virus from a high infectivity carrier mother in at least two individuals, and was also successful in producing a protective level of immunity against the virus in all three of the individuals tested.

Sequencing of the complete hepatitis B genome from one gibbon (Hecla) revealed that she was infected with GiHV (Gibbon hepatitis B virus), an indigenous strain of HBV previously identified in a number of gibbon species, but not previously confirmed in the silvery gibbon. Hecla's strain of HBV was shown to be more closely related to other nonhuman primate strains of HBV than to any of the human strains of HBV. 100% nucleotide similarity to two of Hecla&#146;s siblings indicates that infection in all three animals was the result of vertical transmission from their mother. Partial sequencing of the virus from a second gibbon (Uban) identified another strain of GiHBV which supports the results of the epidemiological study. Neither gibbon showed a high sequence similarity to the virus sequenced from Ivan, the father of the third carrier gibbon (Jury), although only limited sequence data was available from Ivan. Consequently it is likely that at least three different strains of GiHBV are present within the silvery gibbon population.

The information contained in this thesis will assist in the understanding and management of hepatitis B infection in silvery gibbons, as well as the numerous other species of nonhuman primates now shown to be susceptible to this virus.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonhuman Primates</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Silvery gibbon</field><field name="subject">Perth</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050204.154840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caryl Churchill:Representational Negotiations and Provisional Truths</field><field name="creator">andrewgi@tpg.com</field><field name="description">JUDGE: Go away Barbara.

Although English playwright Caryl Churchill wrote the three scripts examined in this thesis more than thirty years ago, each captures our contemporary zeitgeist in sometimes surprising ways. These works explore the shifting politics of power, revealing binary and essentialist representations that not only continue but have been strengthened on all sides in recent years, suggesting their central importance in defining and controlling culture. 

This thesis examines how Churchill subverts conventional forms of representation and probes the ways in which she herself has been represented by critics and scholars at various periods of her writing career. It is my contention that these processes operate in tandem, performing an ongoing dialogue.  Because of the dynamic nature of this dialogue, the aim here is not so much to provide an increasingly unified or finite understanding of the artistic milieu from which a play emerges, as it is to recognize the level of complexity underlying the mutable and political process of its interpretation. 

I have undertaken a detailed exploration of three lesser-known short scripts from 1972, a &#145;watershed&#146; year for Churchill, culminating in the relative success of Owners, her first major stage play. While many of her earlier works have been deserving of further exploration, a number of them have been largely overlooked in the broader environment of her subsequent contribution to contemporary theatre.  The particular scripts that I explore in the course of this thesis are: The Hospital at the Time of the Revolution; Schreber&#146;s Nervous Illness and The Judge&#146;s Wife, an unperformed stage play, a radio play and a television play respectively. These works are worthy of exploration because of their experiments with the politics of subjectivity as it impacts on race, gender and social class, and notions of &#145;legitimacy&#146; that shift with a person&#146;s changing circumstances. Each of these plays implicitly demonstrates the importance of subjectivity in relation to representational power as it places characters who have traditionally been silenced at the centre of the action. 

I have titled my thesis Caryl Churchill: Representational Negotiations and Provisional Truths. In invoking this title I pre-empt the engagement of a subjective, strategic essentialist approach, both in critiquing this period of Churchill&#146;s work and in declaring the assumptions of the arguments contained in the pages that follow.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">plays</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050225.123039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investing Creatively in Sustainability: Cultural Capital &#150;
the New Growth Stock of Sustainable Development.</field><field name="creator">arhodes@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Sustainability is about ensuring that current and future generations have equal access to
resources and a quality of life that provides long-term economic security at the same time
as safeguarding the natural and cultural environment. Using a process of sustainable
development (SD) it is possible to formulate management tools and planning strategies to
change and direct industrial or human activities that are contrary to sustainability. SD
requires unified responses to guide this process through a new set of customs and practice,
and achieve acceptance and changes in the behavior and actions of individuals and
organisations. The outcomes of SD will be determined by the human response to
sustainability, which is in part a cultural response.
Culture has a duality of meaning in every day use. It is either the value system that shapes
the aspirations, identity and attitudes of individuals and groups; or the &#145;way of life&#146; for a
particular group of people who are drawn together through customs, religion, language,
arts, science or technology. Culture has principles in common with sustainability by
bestowing upon current generations cultural heritage and identity, as well as responsibility
for safeguarding future cultural diversity and ecological balance. This thesis suggests that
cultural values are a key to sustainability and that deliberate strategies and criteria are
needed for the arts and creative industries to assist SD. The idea that culture is central to
SD is based on the fact that sustainability is a concept whereas culture is a human value
system and a way of life.
Using the concept of &#145;cultural capital&#146;, this thesis identifies a framework that can guide and
report both the tangible economic and physical outcomes and the intangible benefits that
occur through artistic and cultural activity. Tangible outcomes include artists, buildings and
creative products while intangible benefits lead to cultural identity, diversity and a sense of
place. It is then suggested that if a framework based on cultural capital were applied to SD,
such a process would be called &#145;culturally&#146; sustainable development. The idea of culturally
sustainable development (CSD) is explored in academic and business literature, and in the
practical examples of existing action found in the Western Australian arts and cultural
community.
Based on this intelligence, strategies are identified to provide the next steps for developing
the concept and practice of CSD. Strategies call for government, business and the arts to
have equal responsibility for mainstreaming the concepts of CSD and cultural capital, and
encourage CSD activities and projects. At the implementation level, strategies focus on
developing a universal framework for CSD, incorporating Creative Action Plans or creative
business plans, along with a CSD Index, and a creative cluster approach to project
management or industry development. CSD is about investing creatively in sustainability
through cultural capital, the new growth stock of SD.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural advantage</field><field name="subject">cultural capital</field><field name="subject">culturally sustainable development (CSD)</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050310.100244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender Gymnastics: Performers, Fans and Gender Issues in the Takarazuka Revue of Contemporary Japan</field><field name="creator">pelican02@ozemail.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre company, seeking to investigate its relation to broader issues of gender in contemporary Japan. Takarazuka has simultaneously reinforced and challenged the gender norms of Japanese society for the past ninety years, and indeed provides insights into the construction of those very norms. Takarazuka takes images of masculinity and femininity from mainstream society, the media, arts and popular culture, in both Japan and other countries, and reconstructs them according to its own distinct notions of how gender should be portrayed, both on and off its stage, not only by its performers, but also by fans and creative staff.  Unlike in other single-sex theatrical genres featuring cross-dressing, such as Kabuki, gender is the essential focus of every performance in Takarazuka.  Takarazuka&#146;s practices show that gender is not inherent, but must be learned through observation, imitation and direct instruction, and that various versions of male gender can be assumed for specific purposes, even temporarily, by biological females (and vice versa). Takarazuka&#146;s relationship with gender extends well beyond the stage itself; and one of the ways in which this thesis goes beyond other studies is its focus on the whole life-course of Takarazuka performers, including their girlhood and post-retirement years. 

The relationship with gender issues encompasses fans as well.  The popularity of Takarazuka&#146;s male-role players (otokoyaku), in particular, indicates that the manipulation of gender within a theatrical context has great appeal for audiences. However, many Takarazuka fans, especially female fans of the otokoyaku, evidently not only passively consume the artistry of gender impersonation on its stage, but also actively contribute to its production by communicating their expectations about gender performance to the actors and the Takarazuka administration, and by encouraging each performer to sustain her stage gender off-stage when she appears in public, at least to a certain extent. The emotional investment of fans in supporting Takarazuka is often intense and long-lasting, and their attraction to Takarazuka clearly is not necessarily based solely upon sexuality, as other studies have proposed, but involves broader issues of gender.

The influence of Takarazuka derives not only from its performances, but also from many other aspects of its organisation and gender-linked practices.  Takarazuka&#146;s existence and details about its members and various unique practices are widely publicised by the media.  Its influence upon the social construction of gender in Japan extends beyond the confines of its theatres, its versions of gender roles affecting the lives of many in the general populace apart from those directly involved in performing in, creating or supporting its productions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050310.103233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Factors which Influence Performance Measurement and Management in the Thai Banking Industry: An Application of the Balanced Scorecard Framework</field><field name="creator">ctapanya@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Performance measurement is critical to achieving a firm&#146;s objectives, translating strategy into action and monitoring progress. Selection of a performance measurement system involves a complex interplay between strategy, a firm&#146;s internal and external environment and determination of the relative importance of various measures of performance. 

This dissertation examined the factors which influence performance measurement systems within the context of a highly uncertain and rapidly changing environment via the application of the Balanced Scorecard framework. This framework is a strategic management system and its four pillars of measurement&#150; financial, customers, learning and growth, and internal business process - are influenced by the vision and strategy adopted by the specific organisation.  

Through a series of qualitative and quantitative studies in the Thai banking industry post the 1997 Asian financial crisis, this dissertation shows that institutional forces play a pivotal role in the choice of performance measurement systems, irrespective of strategic orientation and/or firm ownership.  

Specifically, three studies are presented to support this argument.  The first study uses the Miles and Snow (1978) typology to identify the strategic orientation of the Thai banks in order to make some predictions about the type and number of performance measures utilised by these banks.  Results from this study show that bank managers identified their banks&#146; strategy as prospector, defender or analyser irrespective of firm ownership.  This outcome drives the focus of study two.

Study two is a two-part approach examining the forces which have influenced performance measurement in Thailand&#146;s banks via both in-depth interviews conducted with 24 branch managers and the administration of a survey to 60 branch managers.  Results from both studies suggest that coercive and mimetic forces play a pivotal role in the choice of performance measures.  In particular, the study demonstrates that coercive forces at play within the industry put pressure on the banks to focus on financial measures, despite the increased awareness that to remain competitive both types of performance measures are needed.

The final study examines whether the focus on financial indicators has impacted upon the non-financial measure of customer satisfaction for the banks, particularly as the Balanced Scorecard approach suggests utilising multidimensional performance measures to achieve the best performance outcome for the firm.  Results from this study suggest that most customers are not satisfied with firm performance and concludes that there is a need, irrespective of social network forces to focus on both financial and non-financial performance indicators.

These outcomes have both theoretical and practical implications.  From a theoretical point of view, this thesis posits that coercive, mimetic and normative forces need to be included in frameworks such as the Balanced Scorecard, if the true picture of what factors influence performance management and measurement are to be understood.  From a practical perspective, the thesis provides evidence to managers of the need to examine performance measurement from a variety of perspectives in order to meet the needs of all stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bank management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050310.110900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mycorrhizal specificity in endemic Western Australian terrestrial orchids (tribe Diurideae): Implications for conservation</field><field name="creator">Hollick@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The specificity of fungal isolates from endemic Western Australian orchid species and hybrids in the tribe Diurideae was investigated using symbiotic seed germination and analysis of the fungal DNA by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP).  The distribution of the fungal isolates in the field was also assessed using two different seed baiting techniques.  The information from these investigations is essential for developing protocols for reintroduction and translocation of orchid species.  

Two groups of orchids in the tribe Diurideae were studied.  Firstly, a number of Caladenia species, their natural hybrids and close relatives from the southwest of Western Australia were selected because orchid species from the genus Caladenia are considered to have among the most specific mycorrhizal relationships known in the orchid family &#150; an ideal situation for the investigation of mycorrhizal specificity.  Secondly, species of Drakaea and close relatives, from the southwest of Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia, which are never common in nature and occur in highly specialised habitats, were selected to investigate the influence of habitat on specificity.  

Seed from the common species Caladenia arenicola germinated on fungal isolates from adult plants of both C. arenicola and its rare and endangered relative C. huegelii, while seed from C. huegelii only germinated on its own fungal isolates.  The AFLP analysis grouped the fungal isolates into three categories: nonefficaceous fungi, C. huegelii type fungi, and C. arenicola type fungi.  The group of C. huegelii type fungi included some fungal isolates from C. arenicola.  An analysis of the AFLP fingerprints of C. arenicola fungal isolates from different collection locations showed that some, but not all, populations were genetically distinct, and that one population in particular was very variable.  

Despite being thought to have very specific mycorrhizal relationships, Caladenia species hybridise frequently and prolifically in nature, often forming self-perpetuating hybrid lineages.  Five natural hybrids within Caladenia and its closest relatives were investigated.  Symbiotic cross-germination studies of parental and hybrid seed on fungi from the species and the naturally occurring hybrids were compared with AFLP analyses of the fungal isolates to answer the question of which fungi the hybrids use.  The germination study found that, while hybrid seeds can utilise the fungi from either parental species under laboratory conditions, it is likely that the natural hybrids in situ utilise the fungus of only one parental species.  Supporting these observations, the AFLP analyses indicated that while the parental species always possessed genetically distinct fungal strains, the hybrids may share the mycorrhizal fungus of one parental species or possess a genetically distinct fungal strain which is more closely related to the fungus of one parental species than the other.  

The work on Caladenia hybrids revealed that C. falcata has a broadly compatible fungus that germinated seeds of C. falcata, the hybrid C. falcata x longicauda, and species with different degrees of taxonomic affinity to C. falcata.  In general, germination was greater from species that were more closely related to C. falcata: seeds from Caladenia species generally germinated well on most C. falcata isolates; species from same subtribe (Caladeniinae) germinated well to the stage of trichome development on only some of the fungal isolates and rarely developed further; and seeds from species from different subtribes (Diuridinae, Prasophyllinae, Thelymitrinae) or tribes (Orchideae, Cranichideae) either germinated well to the stage of trichome development but did not develop further, or did not germinate at all.  The AFLP analysis of the fungal isolates revealed that the fungi from each location were genetically distinct.  

In situ seed baiting was used to study the introduction, growth and persistence of orchid mycorrhizal fungi.  A mycorrhizal fungus from Caladenia arenicola was introduced to sites within an area from which the orchid and fungus were absent, adjacent to a natural population of C. arenicola.  In the first growing season, the fungus grew up to 50 cm from its introduction point, usually persisted over the summer drought into the second season and even into the third season, stimulating germination and growth to tuber formation of the seeds in the baits.  Watering the inoculated areas significantly increased seed germination.  

Mycorrhizal relationships in Drakaeinae were less specific than in Caladeniinae.  A study of the species Spiculaea ciliata revealed that this species, when germinated symbiotically, develops very rapidly and has photosynthetic protocorms, unlike all other members of the Drakaeinae.  An AFLP analysis of the fungal isolates of this species grouped the isolates according to whether they had been isolated from adult plants or reisolated from protocorms produced in vitro.  Isolates were genetically distinct when compared before germination and after reisolation.  A cross-species symbiotic germination study of seeds of three Drakaea species and one Paracaleana species against fungal isolates from the same species and several other Drakaeinae species revealed lower specificity in this group than previously thought.  A number of fungal isolates from Drakaea and Paracaleana species germinated two or more seed types, while all seed types germinated on fungal isolates from other species and the seed of Drakaea thynniphila germinated to some extent on every fungal isolate tested.  An AFLP analysis of the Drakaeinae fungal isolates supported this information, revealing little genetic differentiation between the fungi of different orchid species.  

An ex situ seed baiting technique was used to examine the role of mycorrhizal fungi in microniche specialisation in the narrow endemic Drakaea.  Soil samples from within and outside two Drakaea populations were tested for germination of the relevant seed types.  In both cases, germination was significantly higher on soil samples from within than outside the populations, suggesting that the relevant mycorrhizal fungi may be restricted to the same microniches as the Drakaea species.  The presence of similar fungi at distant, disjunct locations may be related to the extreme age and geological stabilityof the Western Australian landscape.  

The information from these investigations is essential for developing protocols for reintroduction and translocation of orchid species.  It appears that the mycorrhizal relationships in these groups of orchids are not as specific as was previously thought.  For reintroduction work, a broad sampling strategy is necessary, as it cannot be assumed that the same orchid species has the same fungus at different locations.  A broadly compatible fungus may be of considerable utility in conservation work, such as in situations where a specific fungus appears to have poor saprophytic competence or where soil conditions have been altered.  Seed baiting studies provide additional data on fungal distribution in situ.  In general, molecular data do not provide information about efficacy or fungal distribution, so research programs that combine symbiotic germination studies with seed baiting investigations and genetic analyses of the fungi will provide the maximum benefit for designing more effective conservation programs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">terrestrial orchids</field><field name="subject">mycorrhizal fungi</field><field name="subject">specifity</field><field name="subject">symbiotic germination</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">amplified fragment length polymorphism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050310.91859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education in and for Democracy and Human Rights: Moving from Utopian Ideals to Grounded Practice</field><field name="creator">e.debozy@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is set in the Western Australian education system and centres on the question of how primary schools can actively foster conditions conducive to creating and sustaining education in and for democracy and human rights. In Australia, as elsewhere, there is a widespread acceptance of the need for democratic education also referred to as civics and citizenship education. The perceived lack of public understanding of democratic principles and practices has, in the last decade, led various Australian governments to commit significant resources ($ 31.6 million) to civics and citizenship education programmes such as Discovering Democracy (DD). 
This thesis argues that political engagement and civic learning is most effective when schools commit themselves to deliberately embedding a set of democratic educational principles in everyday practices. In contrast to traditional approaches to citizenship education that tend to focus on the operational aspects of representative governments, institutions and history, this thesis argues that education for Democracy and Human Rights (DaHR) can be effectively achieved through the fostering of DaHR in education. In this task the thesis draws on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The CRC is rooted in a range of basic values about the treatment of children in schools and elsewhere, and encompasses basic rights to which children are entitled.
	The study empirically investigates through up close observations, interviews and surveys the efficacy of pedagogy for civic and citizenship learning in four schools identified as places of strong democratic practice. This study was able to identify particular commonalities between the four case study schools that were conducive to creating and sustaining democratic principles and practices. These schools, although very different in their composition, were lead by principals who shared the view that children under their care were subjects in the making with increasing rights and responsibilities rather than objects to be manipulated, controlled and protected. The findings suggest that experiencing democracy and human rights in daily school life in a variety of situations and on a number of different levels can effectively contribute to the learning of the meaning and advantages of democratic values such as the rule of law, participatory decision-making and due process. It also concludes that there may be a relationship between parental socio-economic background and the possibilities available for students to engage in effective civic learning and citizenship practices. The relationship between socio-economic background and other structural factors including gender and ethnicity in relation to possibilities of civic learning needs to be investigated in a larger study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">civics education</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">discipline</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">student participation</field><field name="subject">childrens rights</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050310.92906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of the Temkin-Poet Model for Electron-Hydrogen Iso-Electronic Series Scattering</field><field name="creator">optimusmaximus@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">An important model in the study of electron-atom collisions was development by Temkin and Poet.

The Karpin Report defined 1995 - 2010 as a developmental period for improving Australian business practices at leader and manager level. It identified five levers for change. Australian businesses were encouraged to focus on globalisation. Life long learning was seen as a key ingredient in up skilling workers and managers for evolving work environments. Australia was advised to build an enterprise-focused culture. Managers and leaders were encouraged to value diversity in the workforce. Enterprises and education and training institutions were encouraged to implement &#145;best practice&#146; procedures.

This study situated the Karpin recommendations in the literature on gender, leadership, management, and Australian social, economic and political conditions. Employing an interdisciplinary approach and using quantitative and qualitative methods, it sought the views of women in senior, middle and frontline or supervisory positions, in large, medium and small businesses.

The study concluded that, in terms of creating diversity within institutionalised leadership, recruitment practices and social circumstances still encouraged the status quo. It found that refocusing Australian business and its leaders was unlikely to provide expanded opportunities for women in leading and managing. The skills women were acknowledged to have often aligned with skills sought for lower management positions. This has been one contributing factor in confining women to lower decision-making roles except in some education and community service environments. In these areas where women often form the majority of workers and reflect the cultures of their industries very successfully, more women occupy senior positions. The study found that women&#146;s skills were comprehensive and suited to roles carrying greater responsibilities. It also discovered that not all of the existing approaches to preparing women to lead and manage served women well; however, some effective strategies were in place. It concluded that for women to be appointed to positions of high responsibility, they should successfully reflect a recognisable management approach, congruent with the company&#146;s and industry&#146;s current style and values. This tended to perpetuate existing practices of competitive individualism and self-interest.

Since the 1980s, managers have been disproportionately elevated in status, with accompanying high salaries and bonuses. There is a risk that leaders will be credited with more wisdom and vision than warranted. Australia leaders need to have a mix of vision and business acumen. While many women managers have this mix and are prepared to be leaders, they may not be appropriately connected to the senior recruitment market. As a subtext, complex levels of vested interests, ties of loyalty and forms of reciprocity often operate in the appointment of senior personnel. Women tend to operate outside these practices and may be reluctant to endorse them. This may partially account for the unchanged circumstances of a small number of women in top senior positions.

The study concluded that the current level of refocusing of Australian businesses was resistant to change and limited in responding to expertise in the marketplace. The challenge of globalisation requires decision-makers with specific skills, knowledge and experiences. It requires people who will act with morality and preferred futures in mind rather than quick returns and advanced levels of self-interest. For organisations keen to identify these kinds of leaders then selection processes will need to differ in order to be highly attuned to recruiting individuals who can help build a responsive, innovative and caring society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050317.140236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Subterranean clover mottle virus towards development of a gene silencing vector.</field><field name="creator">J.Fosu@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV) is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that
infects subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and a number of related legume species.
The ultimate aim of this research was to investigate aspects of SCMoV that would support its
use as a gene silencing vector for legume species, since RNA (gene) silencing is now a
potential tool for studylng gene function. The ability of viruses to induce an antiviral defense
system is being explored by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), in which engmeered viral
genomes are used as vectors to introduce genes or gene ii-agments to understand the function of
endogenous genes by silencing them. To develop a gene silencing vector, a number of aspects
of SCMoV host range and molecular biology needed to be studied.
A requirement for a useful viral vector is a suitably wide host range. Hence the first part of this
work involved study of the host range and symptom development of SCMoV in a range of
leguminous and non-leguminous plants. The aim of this work was to identify new and most
suitable hosts among economically important crop and model legumes for functional genomic
studies, and also to study symptom development in these hosts for comparison with host
responses to any SCMoV-based viral vectors that might be used in later infection studies. A
total of 61 plant genotypes representing 52 species from 25 different genera belonging to 7
families were examined for their response to SCMoV infection, including established and new
crop legumes, established pasture, and novel pasture and forage legumes, and 12 host indicator
plants belonging to the families Amaranthaceae, Apiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cruciferae,
Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae. Following mechanical inoculation, plants were examined for
symptoms and tested for primary and secondary infection by RT-PCR andlor ELISA after 2-3
weeks and 3-9 weeks, respectively. Thirty-six legume hosts belonging to eight different genera
of legumes were identified as suitable hosts of SCMoV, 22 of them systemic hosts and 15 were
infected locally. Only two non-legumes were infected with SCMoV-P23, one systemically and
one as a local host, so confirming that SCMoV is essentially a legume-infecting virus. This
work considerably expanded knowledge of the host range of SCMoV.

To provide the information needed to modify the SCMoV genome to develop gene vectors,
the virus was characterized in detail. The complete genomes of four isolates, SCMoV-AL,
SCMoV-MB, SCMoV-MJ and SCMoV-pFL, were sequenced using high fidelity RT-PCR and
molecular cloning, and compared to the first sequenced isolate (SCMoV-P23) to give a
complete picture of the genome organisation of the virus. The 4,258 nucleotide (nt) sequence
of SCMoV RNA is not polyadenylated. The 5' non-coding region (NCR) is 68 nt in length and
the 3' NCR is 174 nt. The coding regon contains four overlapping open reading fi-ames
(ORFs). The first, OW1 (nt 68-608), encodes a putative protein containing 179 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass (Ma,) of 20.3 kDa. It overlaps with the next ORF, ORF2a, by
four bases. ORF2a (nt 605-2347) encodes a putative protein of 580 amino acids with a Ma, of
63.7 kDa and contains a motif characteristic of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. The ORF2b
is probably translated as part of a polyprotein by -1 ribosomal fiameshifting in ORF2a. The
transfiame product (Ma, = 107.5 kDa) is made up of 966 amino acids. A GDD motif typical of
RNA virus polymerases is present in ORF2b. The 3' terminal ORF3 (nt 3323-4084) encodes
the 27.3 kDa coat protein (CP).
Nucleotide variation between the complete sequences of the isolates was two to three orders of
magnitude larger than base misincoporation rates of the polymerases used in RT-PCR.
Molecular relationship analysis between all five isolates, undertaken with the complete
nucleotide sequences, clearly separated them into three groups. These groups reflect similar
significantly diverse groupings based on the symptoms and their severity in subterranean
clover. Intra-isolate sequence variability is therefore a possible cause of the differences in
symptom severity. The analysis also showed that there were more nucleotide substitutions at
the 5' terminal half of SCMoV than at the 3' end. This observation was confirmed by the
higher value of nucleotide diversities at nonsynonymous versus synonymous sites (dN/ds ratio)
estimated for the ORF1, compared to the near conservation of sequences of the other ORFs.
These results, together with functional and comparative sequence analysis with other
sobemoviruses, implicate the ORFl gene product in pathogenicity of SCMoV, possibly as a
severity determinant or as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in plants.

Because more information on SCMoV genome function was required, the possible involvement
of the ORFl gene product (PI) and the CP in movement of SCMoV was studied in cells of
grasspea (Lathyrus clymenum L) and chickpea as C-terminal fusion constructs with jellyfish
(Aequorea victoriae) green fluorescent protein (GFP). A transient expression vector, pTEV, for
in planta synthesis of reporter gene constructs was developed. The vector was based on
pGEM-T with 35s RNA transcriptional promoter of Caulzjlower Mosaic virus (CaMV) and
nopaline synthase gene transcription terminator signal (T-Nos) separated by a multiple
subcloning site. A custom-made particle inflow gun was used to introduce the constructs into
plant cells. The bombardment conditions were fxst optimised for efficient delivery of DNAcoated
particles. Transient gene expression of GFP was monitored 24-96 hours after particle
bombardment. Fluorescence from GFP alone, GFP:CP and GFP:Pl constructs was observed in
the nucleus of single cells, cytoplasm and cell periphery of neighbouring cells. There was
limited spread of these fusion proteins from one cell to another 36-48 hours after
transformation. These results indicate that the P 1 and CP cannot move independently from cell
to cell. Other viral/cellular components might be needed to form a complex with these proteins
to transport the viral genome. Putative nuclear export signals in the P1 and CP sequences of
SCMoV were identified by sequence comparison. These could be tested by mutagenesis using
full-length infectious clones.
To determine the possibility of gene expression of vectors based on SCMoV, three forms of a
full-length cDNA clone of SCMoV-pFL were developed: one with no heterologous
transcriptional factors (pFL), a second under the control of only 35s (p35SFL) and a third with
35s and T-Nos (pTEVFL). Fifteen day-old in vitro-cultured chickpea, grasspea and
subterranean clover seedlings were inoculated by particle bombardment using gold particles
coated with plasmid pTEVFL. In vivo-transcribed RNA transcripts were detected by RT-PCR
after two weeks in grasspea but not in subterranean clover and chickpea.

Experiments were undertaken towards developing the SCMoV genome into a VIGS vector.
Three forms each of five major GFP chimeric constructs of pFL (the full length SCMoV cDNA
clone) were generated from which in vitro- and in vivo-transcribed RNA transcripts could be
derived. The rationale used in developing these constructs was gene insertion andlor
replacement with d p , and duplication of the putative subgenomic RNA promoter (sgPro) of
SCMoV. The major constructs were as follows:
pFLCPgfp, pFL with the d p gene fused to the 3' end of the CP gene,
pFLP 1 gfp, pFL with gj27 gene fused to the 3 ' end of the ORF 1,
pFLCPsgprogfp, pFL with a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable &amp; gene cloned
in tandem between the CP gene and the 3' NCR of SCMoV,
pFLCPVsgprogf$, pFL with a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable gfp gene
cloned in tandem between a truncated CP gene and the 3' NCR and
pFLREPsgprog@, pFL with the ORF2b, a putative sgPro sequence and a translatable
&amp;fP gene cloned in tandem between a truncated CP gene and the 3' NCR
These constructs were all made, but a detailed assessment of their vector potential could not be
done because there was a delay of about one year whilst the Office of the Gene Technology
Regulator processed the application for permission for glasshouse testing. Although additional
work needs to be undertaken to complete development of a final RNA silencing vector, this
study has contributed to new knowledge in terms of extending understanding of SCMoV host
range, symptoms, sequence variation and control of gene expression. The constructs made
have also laid the groundwork for development of a legume gene silencing vector based on
SCMoV.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viral genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene silencing</field><field name="subject">RNA viruses</field><field name="subject">Subterranean clover</field><field name="subject">Legumes</field><field name="subject">Inoculation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050421.123457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Genetics of Barramundi (Lates Calcarifer)in the Australian Region</field><field name="creator">cmarshall@tobob.com</field><field name="description">Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is a centropomid teleost with a wide distribution across the
Indo Pacific. In Australia, barramundi are native to the tropical zone from Exmouth Gulf
in Western Australia, across the northern part of the continent, to the Mary River in
Queensland. Barramundi are protandrous hermaphrodites, and are euryhaline, with a
catadromous life history. Barramundi are a valuable Australian resource, with important
commercial and recreational fisheries and aquaculture production to the value of $11
million dollars per year. Recent declines in the availability of the fish in some rivers has led
to an interest in the possibility of restocking rivers with barramundi from other areas.

Determining the genetic structure of barramundi populations in Australia is important for
understanding biogeographic history, and appropriate management practices for both
aquaculture and recreational and commercial fishing. Previous studies have concentrated
on the east coast of Australia, and have largely ignored the western populations. In this
study, I obtained DNA data from barramundi populations across the Australian range of
the species, as well as populations from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The aims of
this study were to use the genetic data to determine: 1. if populations in Western Australia
show genetic differences between geographic regions 2. if these populations show an
ancestral split from populations in the east of Australia and 3. the ancestral origins of
Australian barramundi.

Previous studies of DNA data from barramundi have discovered an east/west split
occurring at the Torres Strait that was assumed to be caused by the closing of the strait
during lowered sea levels. However, these studies suffered from a bias in sampling area,
concentrating either on the eastern half of the range of barramundi, or on the western tip
of the range. Data from these studies were combined and reanalyzed. Two major clades
were discovered, with considerable biogeographic structuring, but their geographic
locations did not coincide with the reported vicariance event at the Torres Strait. Instead,
historical divisions among freshwater drainage systems appeared to have driven the
evolutionary history of barramundi in Australia.

In order to investigate these historical divisions further, a 290 bp section of the
mitochondrial DNA control region was sequenced in 284 barramundi from seven
populations across the Australian geographic range of the species and from one population
in Papua New Guinea and one population in Indonesia. Analyses of molecular variance
within and among populations showed significant geographic structuring, based on
biogeographical provinces and drainage divisions. Nested clade analyses indicated that
these geographical associations were the result of restricted gene flow, range expansion,
and past fragmentation events. I hypothesise that the Ord River area in the west of the
continent was the ancestral source population for the rest of the species&#146; range across
Australia, with Indonesia being the most likely origin of this source. Populations of
barramundi from the Pilbara region are genetically distinct and geographically isolated, with
strong evidence of an ancestral divide along geographical barriers to dispersal. There is a
strong association between Papua New Guinea and Australia, although further investigations using the cytochrome b region of mitochondrial DNA indicated a more
ancestral divide between the two than is currently evident, which could reflect an ancient
geographical divide between the two, or could be evidence of a secondary migration route
to Australia.

For a more detailed study of evolutionary processes acting on populations of barramundi in
Western Australia, allelic diversity was examined at five microsatellite loci. All loci were
polymorphic and genotypic frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, with
no significant linkage between loci evident in any population. Measures of within
population diversity were significantly related to latitude, suggesting southerly migration
from a northern source population. The Ord River was the most genetically diverse
population, and the most likely ancestral migration source to the area, with diversity
decreasing down the west coast. Although there were significant differences among
populations, the nuclear microsatellite data do not indicate the same degree of genetic
structuring as is evident in the mitochondrial data. This may be a consequence of rapid
evolutionary change at microsatellite loci, with past separations or population differences
masked by recombination and back mutation of the microsatellite alleles. However, the
nature of nuclear and mitochondrial inheritance may also indicate life history differences
between the sexes, where significant genetic contribution to gene flow by males and limited
female gene flow may lead to preservation of maternally inherited population substructure.

The principal findings from this study are:
&#149; There is no genetic evidence for an east/west division of barramundi populations
in Australia, as suggested by previous research.
&#149; Despite barramundi&#146;s catadromous life history, and ability to disperse through
marine waters, the present genetic structure indicates a division principally among
river drainages. From a population genetic viewpoint, the species can be regarded
as freshwater, rather than marine.
&#149; The most likely origin of barramundi in Australia is the Ord River region, with
Indonesia as the route of migration.
&#149; Differences in the population structure demonstrated by nuclear and mitochondrial
data indicate possible life history differences between the sexes.
&#149; Barramundi populations in different biogeographical provinces may have been
substantially isolated over a long period of time, and may therefore represent
independently evolving populations. This has important implications for fishery
management and translocation issues for restocking rivers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barramundi</field><field name="subject">mt DNA</field><field name="subject">evolutionary genetics</field><field name="subject">mitochondrial genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050421.134447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Population Genetic Structure of Portunus Pelagicus in Australian Waters</field><field name="creator">Esezmis@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the results of an investigation into the population genetic structure
of the blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus, in Australian waters. P. pelagicus is an
Indo-West Pacific species, with adults and juveniles that inhabit sheltered benthic
coastal environments and a planktonic phase (of modest duration) in its life cycle.

The investigation was done by examining the patterns of variation at six microsatellite
loci and in a 342 bp portion of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene in the
mitochondrial DNA in samples of Portunus pelagicus from a total of 16 different
assemblages/waterbodies. Overall, the samples were collected from throughout the
geographical range of this species in Australian waters, i.e. from the western seaboard,
from the eastern seaboard, from Darwin on the north coast and from South Australia on
the south coast. The samples sizes ranged from 4 to 57 individuals, depending on the
sample and the genetic assay. The population genetic structure of P. pelagicus was
analysed from both a traditional population structure perspective and from a
phylogeographical and historical demography perspective.

The traditional assessment of the population genetic structure of Portunus pelagicus
indicates that this species exhibits a significant amount of genetic heterogeneity in
Australian waters (e.g. FST for microsatellite data = 0.098; &#165;&#232;ST for COI data = 0.375 and
&#165;&#213;ST for COI data = 0.492). This assessment also indicates that P. pelagicus exhibits
varying degrees of genetic heterogeneity within and between geographical regions in
Australian waters, as follows. (1) The genetic compositions of the samples from the
different coastlines (i.e. north, south, east and west) invariably showed statistically
significant differences for at least two microsatellite loci, although the differences
between the samples from the eastern seaboard, Darwin and those from the western
seaboard to the north of Port Denison were not as great as those within the western
seaboard samples or within South Australian samples. (2) The genetic compositions of
the samples from the assemblages on the eastern seaboard of Australia, which ranged
from Mackay (21&#168;&#172;06&#161;&#199;S) to Port Stephens (32&#161;&#198;40&#161;&#199;S), were essentially homogeneous. (3)
The samples from the assemblages on the western seaboard of Australia, which ranged
from Broome (17&#161;&#198;58&#161;&#199;S) to Geographe Bay (33&#161;&#198;35&#161;&#199;S), exhibited significant levels of
genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, those from south of Port Denison formed a highly
distinctive (but not invariant) group compared to those from elsewhere. (4) The samples
from South Australia were also highly genetically distinctive compared to those from
elsewhere, although they also showed significant heterogeneity amongst themselves.
The above findings were more or less suggested by both the microsatellite and COI
markers, although the former generally provided a higher resolution picture of the
population structure of P. pelagicus than did the latter.


The main findings of the investigation into the phylogeography and recent demographic
history of Portunus pelagicus in Australian waters were as follows. (1) A phylogeny
constructed from COI sequence variation was shallow, with the lineages showing varied
geographical distributions. (2) The results of a nested clade analysis of this variation
indicate that range expansion has been a predominant influence on the historical
demography of P. pelagicus in Australian waters. (3) The samples from the
assemblages on the western seaboard to the south of Port Denison contained low levels
of genetic diversity, a sub-set of the diversity present in the samples from lower latitude
sites on the western seaboard, and microsatellite-based evidence of having coming from
assemblages that have undergone a bottleneck (or founder effect) followed by an
expansion in size. (4) The samples from the assemblages in South Australia contained
low levels of genetic diversity, phylogenetic affinities with samples from the eastern
seaboard, and microsatellite-based evidence of having coming from assemblages that
have undergone a bottleneck (or founder effect) followed by an expansion in size.

The two major interpretations to stem from the results of this investigation are as
follows. (1) Overall, Portunus pelagicus has undergone a recent (in an evolutionary
sense) range expansion, from a single source, within Australian waters. At a finer-scale,
this species appears to have colonised south-western Australia from a lower latitude
site(s) on the western seaboard and probably colonised South Australia from the
southern margins of its range on the eastern seaboard. Regardless, there has been
limited penetrance of genetic variation into temperate waters on the western seaboard
and into South Australia, presumably due one or more of the barriers to gene flow listed
below. (2) P. pelagicus experiences significant restrictions to gene flow within its
present-day geographical range in Australian waters due to (i) geographic distance per
se; (ii) discontinuities in the distribution of the sheltered coastal environments; (iii)
hydrological barriers to dispersal and (iv) possibly low temperatures in the temperature
margins of the range.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microsatellite</field><field name="subject">mtDNA</field><field name="subject">Portunus pelagicus</field><field name="subject">evolutionary history</field><field name="subject">population structure</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050421.135525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performing arts in regional communities: The case of Bunbury, Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">r.mccarron@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">Abstract
In Australia during the 1990s increased attention was paid to regional, rural and remote communities and, in terms of arts and culture, the establishment of regional arts umbrella organisations, at both national and state levels, stimulated interest in, and development of, the arts in those communities. Discourses around the notion of the civil society and the ways in which social and cultural capital can be acquired and transferred, have led to renewed interest in the economic and social functions of the voluntary, not-for-profit sector of Australian society. 

This thesis aims to advance the critical study of regional cultural development. It examines the role and function of the performing arts within regional communities through a case study of the city of Bunbury, Western Australia. Regional performing arts are often trivialised or marginalised by metropolitan practitioners, critics and academics, particularly as they are almost entirely, in Australia, a volunteer/amateur pursuit. However volunteer performing arts groups provide physical and social spaces that encourage networks of civil engagement that have implications for the functioning of the broader community; and, in the case of Bunbury, a degree of independence from the bureaucratic requirements of arts funding bodies. The thesis proposes that volunteer, not-for-profit (amateur) theatre has a stronger claim on the title &#145;community theatre&#146; than the state-funded community theatre movement of the 1970s and 1980s. 

The thesis also examines the strong community affiliations that have been generated by the community-owned, professionally-managed Bunbury Regional Entertainment Centre. It situates this discussion in the context of the rapidly changing urban landscape in which the Entertainment Centre is placed and its affiliations with local, regional, state and national funding, networking and touring structures. It argues that considerable social and cultural capital is generated through the active involvement of citizens at many levels of the performing arts in a regional community such as Bunbury. Although for most, the involvement is voluntary and recreational, it also has direct economic outcomes in terms of the developing creative industries of the region.

A major contribution of the thesis is the provision of a model for the function and impact of regional community performing arts as it theorises the tensions between governmental (funding) models and self-generated regional arts practices through case study and detailed analysis. In doing so the thesis contributes to key debates in two significant ways, firstly by providing an important historical/cultural document and secondly, by highlighting new ways of thinking and speaking about the role of the performing arts in regional communities.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth theatre</field><field name="subject">amateur theatre</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050501.153348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduce, Reuse, Recycle or Regulate
The National Packaging Covenant and its Application to the Fruit and Vegetable Industry in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Tarbuckle@aapt.net.au</field><field name="description">The National Packaging Covenant is a self-regulatory agreement between industries in the packaging chain and all spheres of government for the management of packaging waste.  The aim of this study is to determine whether the Covenant has the capacity to achieve the environmental objectives of the government in its application to the packaging of fruit and vegetables in Western Australia.  This resolves into two major questions, whether self-regulation is the appropriate policy instrument and whether the Covenant can achieve the environmental objectives of the government.

The analysis proceeds as follows.  A literature review of self-regulation and its relationship to Public Choice Theory to establish the theoretical foundations of the Covenant.   A study of the implementation of voluntary agreements in Europe to determine alternative models and policies.  A survey of growers in Western Australia to establish the extent of knowledge of the Covenant and support for its principles.  An analysis of the Action Plans of Covenant signatories within the industry and an assessment of the response to the Covenant by Federal, State and Local Governments.  Policy recommendations and suggestions for further research conclude the thesis.

The research establishes that the structure of the industry involves a majority of stakeholders (mainly growers) without effective representation, together with small well organised and dominant groups (mainly manufacturers and supermarkets).  The Covenant has had little impact, has failed to engage the majority of stakeholders and is characterised by a general lack of commitment by dominant firms within the industry.  This analysis supports the public choice explanation and the multi-dimensional approach to the research has produced consistent results.  

The major finding of the research is that an effective voluntary agreement requires carefully targeted objectives, negotiations with all stakeholders, incentives for innovation and the certainty of penalties for non-compliance.  Application of these key features to the fruit and vegetable industry in Western Australia may provide the model for the industry in Australia and a model for other industries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">packaging</field><field name="subject">voluntary agreements</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050505.135542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mating system and reproduction in the honey possum, Tarsipes rostratus: a life-history and genetical perspective</field><field name="creator">k.bryant@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The honey possum Tarsipes rostratus, a marsupial endemic to South-Western Australia, feeds exclusively upon nectar and pollen. It is one of the smallest marsupials, with adult females (8-12g) significantly larger than adult males (6-9g). Honey possum males have the longest sperm (356&#181;m) recorded for any mammaland the testes represent 4.2% body weight, amongst the largest recorded formammal species. These features suggest that sperm competition is an importantpart of the mating system. This study used a combination of field based studies,DNA analysis and histological examination of the female reproductive tract toinvestigate the life history, multiple paternity and reproduction of the honey possum innatural populations in the Fitzgerald River National Park (FRNP), on the south coastof Western Australia.

This study drew upon earlier work on the honey possum in the FRNP in order to describe its life-history. The honey possum is short-lived (1-2 years), and attains sexual maturity whilst still growing. All four teats are occupied after birth, but the litter is reduced to 2 or 3 young during pouch life. The young have a relatively slow rate of
growth. Breeding occurs continuously throughout the year, but is affected by the flowering phenologies of its foodplants. The greatest proportion of females with
pouch-young occurs in winter; there are fewest pouch-young in autumn, a time of year when there is a dearth of flowers. Honey possums are essentially solitary animals, with no structured social unit, and male and female home ranges overlap. In captivity they are largely tolerant of one another, but larger females are behaviorally dominant to smaller females and to males.

The densities and structure of the honey possum populations in the FRNP were analyzed from trapping data collected over 19 years. Population densities fluctuated
significantly from season to season throughout the year, with changes in the flowering food resources available. There were also year-to-year differences in the intensity of those fluctuations, and these were significantly associated with rainfall in the previous year, and probably mediated through a lag effect in the flowering of the honey possum&#146;s foodplants. The greatest densities of animals occurred over winter. In years following high rainfall, mean winter densities reached 88 individuals per
hectare. The lowest densities occurred in spring, and in years following low rainfall mean spring densities fell to 8 individuals per hectare. Even at these lowest densities, there is still the potential for interaction between males and females. A succession from high to low, then back to high densities was seen during the three years of the present study (2000-2002) and this shadowed a similar succession of changes in rainfall.

The proportion of females with pouch-young was significantly affected by the season, and by rainfall in the previous year. Years following low rainfall had a lower
proportion of females in a condition to breed. The autumn dip in breeding that occurred in all years was exacerbated following dry years. Of those females that did breed in 2001, a time of low resources, there was no difference in the size of the litter compared to 2000 and 2002, times of higher resource availability. The sex-ratio of pouch young was at parity, but there was a slight bias towards males among both juveniles (56%) and adults (58%). This was probably due to the greater movements shown by males. Sex ratios were not affected by changes in rainfall and density. Male-biased dispersal was detected using genetic data and the movement patterns of males showed that they moved greater distances than females during their normal
activity.

Analysis of four microsatellite loci revealed extremely high levels of variation, with 28 to 50 alleles per locus and a mean expected heterozygosity of 0.95. These are
amongst the highest seen in any microsatellite study of vertebrates. There was multiple paternity in 86% litters, using a minimum number of sires per litter method,
and in 95% litters, using an estimated number of sires method based upon the relatedness of litter males. This indicates that multiple mating is frequent in female
honey possums and is evidence for sperm competition. The estimated number of sires in a litter was often three or four. In 41% of cases, the number of sires was less
than the number of young in the litter, indicating that some males were more successful at siring offspring than others. Nevertheless, no more than two offspring in a litter were known to have been sired by the same male. Despite marked fluctuations in density from high in 2000, to low in 2001, then high again in 2002, the level of multiple paternity remained equally high in all years.

Embryonic diapause and female reproduction was investigated in the honey possum. All adult females examined, both with and without pouch-young, were either close to oestrus, had ovulated or were carrying conceptuses. The honey possum has a postpartum
oestrus and it was evident that this occurs approximately 2-4 days after birth. Cleavage and formation of the unilaminar blastocyst appears to occur rapidly over
approximately 5 days. Embryonic diapause proceeded in a two phase manner similar to other small possum species. The unilaminar blastocyst expanded rapidly at first; and then, from about 18-20 days after birth, the diameter of the blastocyst remained constant at approximately 1.2-1.8mm. No growth or development beyond the unilaminar stage was observed during pouch-life. The first signs of reactivation occurred during lactation, after pouch exit, and expansion of the blastocyst only occurred in one post-lactational female. The development of the corpus luteum
appeared different to patterns described for other marsupials, but its formation
coincided with the formation of the unilaminar blastocyst. The diameter of the corpus luteum remained constant throughout diapause. The histology of the reproductive
tract was generally similar to other marsupials. There were no sperm storage crypts in the female reproductive tract.

The length of pouch-life in the honey possum was 55-65 days, and the interval between litters of the same size varied between 65 and 100 days. Embryonic diapause may reduce the time between production of successive litters in the honey possum, but lifetime reproductive potential is reasonably low. Females had up to four litters over the period that they were captured. Thus, each litter represents a substantial proportion (25%) of a female&#146;s lifetime reproductive output. Reproductive amortization occurred, with 61% loss overall, due to overproduction of ova, loss of conceptuses and reduction of the litter during lactation.

The behavioural dominance of females suggests that multiple mating is an active strategy, and this presumably allows the genetic quality of their offspring to be maximized. Males that succeed in sperm competition may be of better intrinsic quality. Overproduction of conceptuses by females presents the opportunity for them to select those fertilized by intrinsically viable males or genetically compatible males. Sexually active males are present all year round. Females were not synchronous in
their sexual receptivity, and this would lead to a skewed operational sex ratio, with more reproductive males than oestrous females. Since adult males are significantly
smaller than adult females and possess no ornaments or armaments, it is unlikely that males overtly fight for access to females. Rather, males appear to monitor the
reproductive status of females through smell, and probably compete in their ability to locate oestrous females. The risk and intensity of sperm competition is high, sexual
selection for a large investment in spermatogenesis is evident and competition after copulation is probably an important factor in the mating system. It is likely that males, as well as females mate multiply, and the mating system is promiscuous.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mating systems</field><field name="subject">tarsipes rostratus</field><field name="subject">honey possum</field><field name="subject">microsatellite</field><field name="subject">sperm competition</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">embryonic diapause</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050505.140613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using a Contingent Heuristic Approach and Eye Gaze Tracking for the Usability Evaluation of Web Sites</field><field name="creator">pilunp@gmail.com</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a research study in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically usability evaluation. The research investigated ways to optimise the usability of Web sites. It specifically compared Flash and HTML versions of several different types of Web sites. The study commenced with a literature review regarding the process of usability evaluation of Web sites. Various usability evaluation methods and techniques were explored, and two emerging techniques were chosen for further investigation: (1) a contingent heuristic approach; and (2) eye gaze tracking. In order to confirm that these two techniques can be used effectively for Web site usability evaluations, two experiments were conducted to evaluate the usability of Web sites. The first experiment utilised an online questionnaire derived from the Website Usability Contingent Evaluation Tool (WUCET), which was based on the contingent heuristic approach. The second experiment involved eye gaze tracking with the faceLAB system, while participants interacted with Web sites of different types. Both experiments utilised Flash and HTML versions of the same set of Web sites. By analysing data collected from the experiments, comparisons between the usability of Flash and HTML versions were made. The results from quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey responses suggested that Flash version of Web sites, in general, provided higher usability than HTML version of Web sites, but eye gaze tracking data analyses showed no significant difference between the two versions. However, analyses of the eye tracking data were useful for improving understanding of the ways in which users interact with different versions of the Web sites. In addition, other influential factors that could affect the perceived usability of the Web sites, such as user&#146;s gender and previous experience with computers and the Web, were also considered. The results of the experiments showed that in regard to Flash and HTML implementations of Web sites, there was a difference in Web site usability perception patterns between male and female users, and also between users with long-term computer/Web experience and users with short-term experience. In addition, a range of different types (purposes) of Web sites were utilised. In this study, selected Web sites fall into three broad categories according to their main purpose: (1) information; (2) entertainment; and (3) e-commerce. It was discovered that the type of Web sites also influenced the usability of Flash and HTML versions of Web sites, as perceived by users.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Usability evaluation</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">contingent heuristic</field><field name="subject">eye gaze tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050510.132804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding, modelling and predicting transport mobility in urban environments</field><field name="creator">Knebworth@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">In the last three decades the global population has been growing at an essentially constant rate, at around 1.5 per cent per year, to about 6.026 billion in 2000 when it was estimated that 47% of that population live in an urban environment.  Further, a United Nations&#146; projection indicates that 60% of the total global population may be living in an urban settlement by the year 2025.  This increasing urbanisation brings with it increased employment, that delivers affluence, which then continues the cycle of migration and movement to these growing metropolitan areas in both developed and developing countries.
As cities increase in population and expand their urban area, there is a consequential expansion of urban transportation and accompanying service infrastructure.  People travel daily, irrespective of their vast differences in culture, economic conditions and means of transportation.  This daily mobility is sought for its own sake as well as to bridge the spatial distance that separates their homes from the work place, to accomplish their household&#146;s domestic needs and to undertake social journeys, such as visiting friends and taking holidays.
As the world&#146;s urban population undertakes its daily mobility by a variety of transportation modes, an individual&#146;s mobility behaviour and mode-choice is governed by a complex matrix of physical and human, social and management indicators, measures and/or drivers.  A literature review describes the current understanding of this complex matrix and concludes by identifying and defining a set of fundamental underlying measures that drive private motorised, public transport and non-motorised (walking and bicycling) mobility at national, city and household levels.
As practical instruments, transportation models play an important role in providing decision-makers with analytical tools to help them understand their city&#146;s transportation and the different future scenarios it may face.  While not necessarily producing foolproof information or predictions, models are still the best methods available to test the likely implications of alternative transportation policy decisions in a rapidly changing urban environment.  Urban transport models are generally based on the notion that traffic can be modelled in aggregate measures through statistical data and predictive modelling techniques.
In this research, dimensional analysis is used to derive sketch-plan models for private motorised, public transport and non-motorised mobility for any urban environment based on four-decades of detailed land-use and travel pattern data from a large international sample of cities.  These models are developed on the basis of a set of fundamental underlying measures that are deemed to drive private motorised, public transport and non-motorised (walking and bicycling) mobility at the city level.
Importantly, the models also embody three key attributes.  They are:
&#149;	easy to use, minimising user requirements and data inputs
&#149;	policy-sensitive, capable of assessing a sufficient range of policy options
&#149;	reliable and robust over time, so that the results can be consistently believed.
The capacity of the sketch-plan models to predict personal mobility in an urban environment is statistically validated against an independent land-use and travel pattern data set for 83 cities located on five continents.  Despite their simplicity and maintaining a consistent functional form over a time-series of four-decades and across all geographic and cultural regions, the private motorised mobility model can consistently explain up to 92% of the variance in private motorised urban mobility.  The results for the public transport mobility model are less reliable and consistent, in particular when developing cities are part of the model.  Results for developed or wealthier cities are much better.  Reasons for these results and their inadequacies are discussed.  The non-motorised modes mobility model is the least successful part of the modelling work.  This can be attributed to a combination of inadequate data and, very likely, the more micro-level determinants of usage of these modes.
The private motorised urban mobility sketch-plan model equation developed in this thesis is able to predict present and future trends of automobile use in individual cities to a high degree of statistical reliability.  The model equation offers urban transport planners a focused direction on the fundamental measures that have the potential to control and deliver automobile restraint policies and strategies.  A series of case studies shows that this model has wide applications in understanding past trends in private motorised mobility and in developing urban environmental strategy and policy through its ability to calculate and assess current and future motor vehicle emissions inventories in cities.  The thesis makes suggestions for future work in this area of metropolitan level transport modelling, in particular, how to improve the public and non-motorised transport models so that total urban transport mobility can be better understood and modelled.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">predict</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">mobility</field><field name="subject">urban</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050513.141512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and Characterization of Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis Gene Promoters</field><field name="creator">tdschoep@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">A family of E. coli - P. ruminis shuttle-plasmids was constructed to allow the isolation
and characterization of gene promoters from the rumen bacterium P. ruminis. The
promoter rescue plasmid pBK was used to isolate a total of 4 genomic DNA fragments
that promoted transcription in P. ruminis strains 0/10. These promoters, and an
additional promoter, previously isolated from P. ruminis strain OR38 (Schoep, 1999),
were identified by their ability to initiate expression of a promoterless ermAM gene in
P. ruminis. Within 4 of the fragments, a total of 5 transcription start sites were identified
in P. ruminis using a novel, fluorescent-primer extension analysis protocol. Comparison
of promoters isolated in this and previous studies revealed a strong consensus RNA
polymerase DNA-binding motif, including the well characterized &#150;35 and &#150;10 elements.
Consensus sequences established for these elements were: TTgacA and AtAATAta
respectively, where bold upper-case font, regular upper-case, and lower-case fonts
represent conservation in 100%, 80%, and 70% of promoters respectively. The &#8722;10 and
&#8722;35 motifs were interspaced by 16 &#150; 18 nt. Among the newly identified promoters, the
consensus for the &#150;10 element was extended one nucleotide upstream and downstream
of the standard hexamer (boxed). These motifs were similar to those recognized by
eubacterial RNA polymerase containing the &#963;70-like factor. Promoters also contained
possible UP elements, and were significantly more curved than protein-coding regions.
Additional plasmid vectors were constructed, to allow the use of both the quantitative
SYBR green real time PCR and &#223;-glucuronidase assays, to examine 4 promoters in
depth. This showed a wide range of promoter strengths within the group. However, no
correlation was found between the composition and context of elements within P.
ruminis promoters, and promoter strength. A mutation within the &#150;35 element of one
promoter revealed that promoter strength, and the choice of transcription start site were
both sensitive to single nucleotide</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudobutyrivibrio</field><field name="subject">promoter</field><field name="subject">consensus</field><field name="subject">RNA polymerase</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050527.112003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid Evolution of Diversity in the Root Nodule Bactria of Biserrula Pelecinus L.</field><field name="creator">kemanthi@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Biserrula pelecinus L. has been introduced to Australia from the Mediterranean region, in the last decade due to many attractive agronomic features. This deep rooted, hard seeded, acid tolerant and insect resistant legume species provides high quality food for cattle and sheep, and grows well under the harsh edaphic and environmental conditions of Australia. In 1994, B. pelecinus was introduced to a site in Northam, Western Australia where there were no native rhizobia capable of nodulating this legume. The introduced plants were inoculated with a single inoculant strain of Mesorhizobium sp., WSM1271. This study investigated whether a diversity of rhizobia emerged over time. A second objective was to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in the diversification of rhizobia able to nodulate B. pelecinus.

Eighty eight isolates of rhizobia were obtained from nodules on B. pelecinus growing at the Northam site in August 2000, six years after introduction. These plants were self-regenerating offspring from the original seeds sown. Molecular fingerprinting PCR with RPO1 and ERIC primers revealed that seven strains (novel isolates) had banding patterns distinct from WSM1271 while 81 strains had similar banding patterns to WSM1271. A 1400 bp internal fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced for four of the novel isolates (N17, N18, N45 and N87) and WSM1271. The phylogenetic tree developed using these sequences clustered the novel isolates in Mesorhizobium. There were &gt;6 nucleotide mismatches between three of the novel isolates (N17, N18, N87) and WSM1271 while there were 23 nucleotide mismatches between N45 and WSM1271. 

When B. pelecinus cv. Casbah was inoculated with the novel isolates, five (N17, N18, N39, N46 and N87) yielded &lt;40% of the shoot dry weight of the plants inoculated with the original inoculant (WSM1271). Novel isolates N15 and N45 were completely ineffective on B. pelecinus cv. Casbah.    
Physiological experiments to test the ability of the novel isolates and WSM1271 to grow on 14 different carbon sources (N acetyl glucosamine, arabinose, arbutine, dulcitol, &#946;-gentiobiose, lactose, maltose, melibiose, D-raffinose, saccharose, L-sorbose, D-tagatose, trehalose and D-turanose) as the sole source of carbon, intrinsic resistance to eight different antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, spectinomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline) and pH tolerance (pH 4.5, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0) revealed that the novel isolates had significantly different carbon source utilization patterns to WSM1271. However, pH tolerance and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics were similar between the novel isolates and WSM1271 except for streptomycin (100 &#956;g/ml). Novel isolates N17, N18, N46 and N87 were susceptible for this antibiotic while the other novel isolates and WSM1271 were resistant.

Host range experiments were performed for the novel isolates N17, N18, N45, N87, WSM1271 and two other root nodule bacteria (RNB) previously isolated from B. pelecinus growing in the Mediterranean region (WSM1284 and WSM1497) for twenty one legumes (Amorpha fruticosa, Astragalus adsurgens, Astragalus membranaceus, Astragalus sinicus, Biserrula pelecinus cv Casbah, Dorycnium hirsutum, Dorycnium rectum, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Hedysarum spinosissimum, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus corniculatus, Lotus edulis, Lotus glaber, Lotus maroccanus, Lotus ornithopodioides, Lotus parviflorus, Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus peregrinus, Lotus subbiflorus, Macroptilium atropurpureum, and Ornithopus sativus). Only isolate N17 have the same host range as WSM1271 in that they both nodulated B. pelecinus and A. membranaceus, while the other three novel isolates, WSM1284 and WSM1497 had a broader host range than WSM1271. Three isolates N18, N45 and N87 formed small white nodules on M. atropurpureum, in addition to nodulating the above hosts. Isolates N18 and N45 also nodulated A. adsurgens while N45 was the only isolate to nodulate L. edulis. Isolate N87 was the only isolate to nodulate A. fruticosa.  WSM1497 nodulated A. adsurgens, A. membranaceus, B. pelecinus and L. corniculatus while WSM1284 was a promiscuous strain that nodulated 16 host species out of the 21 tested.   
A 710 bp internal region of nifH, a 567 bp internal region of nodA and a 1044 bp internal region of intS were sequenced for N17, N18, N45, N87 and WSM1271. The sequence comparison showed that the sequences of the above three genes of the four novel isolates were identical to that of WSM1271.  

Eckhardt gel electrophoresis revealed that WSM1271, three other RNB isolates from B. pelecinus from the Mediterranean region and isolate N18 each have a plasmid of approximately 500 kb while N17, N45 and N87 are plasmid free. Probing of the plasmid DNA from the Eckhardt gel with nifH and nodA probes indicated that these two genes were not located on the plasmid.

Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrated that 92% of the nodules on B. pelecinus growing in the Northam site six years after the introduction of this plant were occupied by the inoculant strain and the N2 fixation efficiency of the progeny strains of WSM1271 remain similar to the mother culture. This study also showed that the carbon source utilization pattern, intrinsic antibiotic resistance and pH range of the progeny strains of WSM1271 remain relatively similar, except for few variations in carbon source utilization patterns. 
This thesis clearly demonstrated that phenotypicaly, genetically and phylogenetically diverse strains capable nodulating B. pelecinus evolved through symbiotic gene transfer from the inoculant strain to other soil bacteria within six years. The presence of intS, and the evidence of gene transfer between these Mesorhizobium strains indicates that transfer of symbiotic genes may have occurred via a symbiosis island present in WSM1271.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Root nodule bacteria</field><field name="subject">rhizobia</field><field name="subject">Biserrula</field><field name="subject">pasture legumes</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050601.190845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Westralian Scots:

By comparison to the eastern Australian colonies, Western Australia attracted the least number of Scottish migrants. This thesis aims to broaden the historiography of Scottish settlement in Australia in the nineteenth century by providing insights into the lives of Westralian Scots. 

While this thesis broadly documents Scottish settlement, its main focus is Scottish identity. Utilising techniques of nominal record linkage and close socio-biographical scrutiny, this study looks beyond institutional manifestations of Scottish identity to consider the ways in which Scottishness was maintained in everyday lives through work, social and religious practices. This thesis also demonstrates the multi-layered expressions of national identity by recognising Scottish identity in the Australian colonies as both Scottish and British. The duality of a Scottish and British identity made Scots more willing to identify eventually as Westralian Scots.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scottish identity</field><field name="subject">colonial Western Australia</field><field name="subject">migrants</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050602.121220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multidimensional Developmental Neuropsychological Model of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): 
Examining Evidence for Impairments in &#145;Executive Function&#146;</field><field name="creator">chris.theunissen@health.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious psychiatric disorder characterised by turbulent interpersonal relationships, impaired self image, impulsivity, and a recurrent pattern of unstable affect which is usually evident by early adulthood. It has a community prevalence rate of two per cent, and approximately nine per cent of people diagnosed with BPD commit suicide. This suggests that BPD has one of the highest lethality rates of all psychiatric disorders. The course of the disorder shows a steady improvement over the course of early adulthood with the majority of cases remitting by middle age. This positive but incomplete long-term recovery is thought to be a naturalistic outcome that is independent of treatment effect.
	The reported study sought to test selected components of a multidimensional developmental neuropsychological model of executive functioning in BPD. The model proposed that BPD is characterised by impairments to four neuropsychological executive functions. These include working memory, response inhibition, affective-attentional bias, and problem-solving. The model further proposed that impaired executive functioning in BPD occurs as a result of the failure of &#145;experience-dependent&#146; maturation of orbitofrontal structures. These structures are closely associated with the development of the &#145;cognitive executive&#146;. 
The study incorporated a cross-sectional design to analyse data from a BPD group, a Depressed Control Group, and a Medical Control Group. The overall findings of the study returned limited support for the original hypotheses. There was no evidence of deficits in working memory, response-inhibition, or problem-solving. In contrast, the BPD group returned some evidence of deficits in affective-attentional bias. 
	Therefore, the results suggest that executive functioning remains largely intact in BPD. This also suggests that people with BPD have the working memory resources necessary to facilitate abstract cognition, have the capacity to effectively plan and execute future-oriented acts, and are able to perform appropriate problem-solving functions. These problem-solving returns are also particularly significant because a number of the tasks utilised in the study are known to be associated with so-called &#145;frontal-executive&#146; function. These unremarkable findings challenge the view that people with BPD might experience some form of subtle neurological impairment associated with frontal-lobe compromise. 
	The Stroop measure of affective-attentional bias provided the only supportive evidence for the proposed model, and these findings can be accounted for by at least two different explanations. The first suggests that BPD might be characterised by a hypervigilant attentional set. The specific cause of hypervigilance in BPD is unknown, but some candidate factors appear to be the often-reported abuse histories of borderlines, insecure attachment histories, and deficits in parental bonding. The second interpretation suggests that the Stroop findings reflect a form of &#145;response conflict&#146; in which BPD participants experience difficulties overriding tasks that rely on the enunciation of automatic neural routines. 
As a result of these findings, further research on the role of arousal, priming, hypervigilance, and response-conflict in BPD is required. It is likely that the Stroop findings reflect a basic, &#145;hard-wired&#146; attentional mechanism that consolidates by early adolescence at the latest. As a result, the Stroop findings have implications for both the prevention and treatment of BPD. 
	A number of prevention strategies could be developed to address the attentional issues identified in the present study. These include assisting children to more effectively regulate arousal and affect, and assisting parents to communicate affectively with children in order to enhance self-regulation. The treatment implications suggest that interventions directed at affective-attentional processes are required, and further suggest the need for new pharmacotherapies and psychological treatments to modify dysfunctional attentional process. Affective neuroscience will have an increasingly important role to play in the understanding of BPD, and the next quarter century is likely to witness exciting advances in understanding this most problematic of disorders.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Borderline Personality Disorder</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">Executive Disorders</field><field name="subject">Personality Disorder</field><field name="subject">Developmental Psychopathology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050602.162509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex Allocation and Reproductive Costs in a Gull with a Long Breeding Season.</field><field name="creator">Christinelamont@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The Silver Gull is a small gull (265 - 450g), which exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females. It has a protracted laying period of about 8 months over the winter on Penguin Island in Western Australia. The Silver Gull was studied on Penguin Island from 2000 to 2002. Completed clutches were removed from breeding pairs to induce repeat laying in order to determine the effect of increased reproductive effort on maternal body condition, egg production ability, offspring sex ratio and chick rearing capacity.

Increased egg production had no significant effect on maternal body condition as measured by condition index, derived from mass divided by a measure of skeletal size. The seasonal period, divided into thirty-day intervals, had a significant impact on female condition index, with a decline in condition toward the end of the breeding season. While male condition also appeared to decline at the end of the season, this pattern was not significant.

The initiation of laying varied between the three years of the study. The earliest occurred in 2000, which also experienced earlier rainfall than the later two years. Egg size and mass decreased throughout the breeding season although the number of eggs in a clutch did not decline. The size and mass of the eggs was significantly affected by the laying history of the parents, although this effect was dependent on the year in which the eggs were produced. 

The minimum interval required by Silver Gulls to replace a lost clutch is about 14 days. This interval increased from the start of the breeding season, but then declined toward the end, as summer was approaching. Laying interval increased significantly as the number of clutches produced by the parents also increased, up to 4 clutches in total. As more clutches were produced past this point, the laying interval became shorter. 

The probability of a replacement clutch being produced after clutch removal, declined as the clutch number increased and as the season progressed. Individuals that laid clutches with a larger mean mass were more likely to lay a replacement clutch. Increasing reproductive output caused a decline in the proportion of clutches that were replaced after clutch removal. The proportion of clutches that were replaced also varied between the years with the highest rates of replacement seen in 2000 which was also the year that experienced the earliest start in laying. The size of the original clutch in terms of its mean mass and volume was related to the size of the replacement clutch, but this relationship varied according to the timing of laying. 

During 2000 and 2001 male offspring predominated in the first two clutches produced by Silver Gulls. Further clutches that were produced demonstrated a sex ratio skewed toward females, the smaller sex in this species. Offspring sex ratio was close to equality in 2002 with very little effect caused by increased egg production. There was no effect of year, season or the laying history of the parents on hatching success. Growth rate in chicks was influenced by the year in which the chick hatched, the period during the season in which the chicks hatched, its sex and the laying history of the parents. The relationship between chick growth and the laying history, however, was complex with no consistent pattern emerging in terms of the performance of chicks from each treatment group. While the chicks from control groups generally grew faster than the chicks from manipulated parents, those individuals that were laid or raised by manipulated parents that had laid at least three clutches in total also performed well. 

Using the two main measures of reproductive success in the current study, egg production and chick rearing, those birds that were induced to lay multiple replacement clutches, were able to maintain a high level of condition and reproductive success. It is proposed that in the Silver Gull, only those individuals with a high level of condition continue to lay replacement clutches. If the female is unable to produce well provisioned eggs with a high chance of success, the breeding attempt is abandoned. Despite no loss of condition detected in female Silver Gulls with increasing clutch number, there was a significant shift in the offspring sex ratio toward females, indicating that strategies were in place to cope with the increased reproductive effort incurred as a consequence of repeat laying. Protracted laying in this species allows replacement of lost clutches only after maternal condition has been regained after laying.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silver gull</field><field name="subject">life history strategy</field><field name="subject">offspring sex ratio</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050617.102950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Poetics of Being</field><field name="creator">MirahB@aol.com</field><field name="description">The aim of The Poetics of Being is to inquire into how the
apperception of the Being of beings is produced. We will
recognize this production not primarily in philosophy, but in a
medium accessible to us all, theatre. Although the Romantic
tradition of literary criticism from Herder to Bloom has noted
that Shakespeare produces an exceptional sense of what is
[true], so much so that he is said to create the impression of
nature or life, no one has so far attempted to show how
precisely Shakespeare affects this experience. Contrary to T.
S. Eliot, who is unable to discern any kind of poetics in
Shakespeare&#146;s plays, we have discovered an insistent and
consistent pattern of inadequation, a kind of mismatch. The
thesis argues, that the predominant tropes of inadequation are
falsity, dissimilarity, nothing, indefinition, elision and
substitution. We shall show that these figures of inadequation
are the universal means by which Shakespeare, almost
imperceptibly, compels the spectator to infer the apperception
of what is [true].

On the basis of these tropes of inadequation the thesis makes
the fundamental philosophical claim that the cognition of Being
through non-Being is a negative form of what Heidegger calls
the ontological difference. We call this the negative ontological
difference. The thesis demonstrates that with the exception of
some Pre-Socratic thinkers, Plato in the Sophist, the work of
Pseudo-Dionysius, and the writings of Derrida, the bulk of the
tradition of Western philosophy has argued Being in terms of
positivities. While the thesis does not question the possibility
of realizing the ontological difference in a positive fashion, as
does Heidegger&#146;s philosophy of unconcealment, the thesis
claims that the negative ontological difference, or ontological
contradiction, is the more forceful process by which we
become aware of what is [true].</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shakespeare</field><field name="subject">poetics</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050617.103850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Professional Culture on Dispute Resolution in the Building Industries of Australia and Sri-Lanka</field><field name="creator">29970421@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The construction industry poses a number of challenges to those working in it. One important challenge is that the industry is dependent upon human interactions in the
management of building projects. In this environment it is important for those who manage the projects to deal with intricate relationships and to consider the emotions,
interactions and various types of reasoning that lie behind the actions and decisions taken by the participants in the construction process.

The issue for researchers is to gain a better understanding of the variables that affectthe actions of the participants in this process. Such research demands sensitivity to the values, attitudes and behavior developed by the different occupational groupings.
These factors according to Edgar Schein define the culture of a professional group. This research was conceived on the belief that the professionals in the construction
industry brought to bear their own professional culture on the industry. It was necessary to have a better understanding of this culture in order to be able to resolve disputes that occur in the construction process. 

That is the impact of culturally deternlined values, attitudes and behavior of these professional groups.
Therefore, this research is aimed at investigating the professional cultures of the participants who come together in a construction project. The question posed was
whether they shared a culture or had differences, and if differences existed whetherthese differences had an effect on the reactions of each of the groups to disputes and
their resolution.

A survey was carried out among professional groups in Australia and Sri-Lanka and the survey data from both countries were analyzed using statistical tests. The results show that professional groups share similarities in professional culture as well as differences. It also showed that these cultural differences created an adversarial atmosphere among construction project participants. It was also found that introducing a party outside of the usual professional groups would be beneficial in the resolution process. Respondents were of the opinion that the third party outside of the construction team could be a lawyer.

This type of research is still new within the field of construction. The contributions of this work are to link professional culture and conflict and give some indication how such conflict could be addressed. In this context by identifying the values attitudes and behavior of professional groups the subject of conflict and disputes could be beneficially addressed through professional education.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050628.114846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean cruising: a study of affirmative deviance</field><field name="creator">j.macbeth@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Modern day ocean voyaging in private sailing vessels dates back to the turn of the century. Despite this, the present thesis is the first academic study of ocean cruising to be completed. Of the thousands of people who make ocean voyages only a few hundred are committed to the lifestyle of cruising, that is, see cruising as a whole way of life that they will pursue indefinitely. The thesis first presents an ethnography of the lifestyle of cruising with particular attention to (1) what activities constitute the lifestyle, (2) why people cruise, and (3) what values, attitudes, and characteristics attach to the participants. Second, the thesis relates this ethnography to several theories in sociology and psychology.

In sociology, subculture and deviance theories are used to place cruising in the context of the wider scholastic study of society. Pearson (1979) and others are drawn upon in placing cruising in the context of subcultures while the work of Walter Buckley (1967) is used to modify deviance theory to account for the apparently positive nature of the deviance inherent in the cruising lifestyle.

In psychology, theories of autotelic rewards, enjoyment, and human satisfaction are used to understand the experience of and motivation to cruise. In addition, theories of personal growth developed by Hampden-Turner (1970) and others are applied to cruisers and their way of life.

The thesis concludes that cruisers, as cultural 'heroes', can be seen as affirmative deviants. That is to say, given an humanistic and western individualistic value system their deviance can be seen as contributing to their individual health and growth, and to positive social evolution.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subcultures</field><field name="subject">sailing</field><field name="subject">ocean sailing</field><field name="subject">yacht crusing</field><field name="subject">deviance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050628.120609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">African Cultural Education: A dialogue with African migrant youth in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">p_wakholi@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">African Cultural Education: A dialogue with African migrant youth in Western Australia&#146;, examines cultural issues that concern a specific group of African migrant youths. The ten youth participants three of whom are male and seven female share their concerns and desires about issues relating to their cultural identity. As a minority group in a predominantly Eurocentric society they are faced with cultural challenges, which influence their being namely: Racism and the pressure to assimilate.

    The thesis adopts an Afrikan1 Centred Cultural Democracy approach: which proposes that African people must construct a &#145;new&#146; African identity and must begin to perceive and interpret the world in its entirety from an African psychological, spiritual, and cultural frame of reference. This approach requires an ongoing critical assesement of both subjective lived experience and objective conditions. Through the Ujamaa circle process the youth participants along with the facilitator examined challenges to their cultural identities and alternative liberatory options. Growing up in a culturally alienating Eurocentric culture, they felt the need for an African cultural space, in which they could explore issues affecting them as African descendants. In particular racism and assimilation were of major concern to them. They were of the opinion that there should be an ongoing African Cultural Education Program to facilitate cultural re-evaluation and continuity.

    It is the study&#146;s conclusion that cultural education for a minority African migrant group in a dominant Eurocentric culture is essential for their identities and continued root-cultural connectedness. Within the African Cultural Education conceptual framework, in addition to African cultural re-evaluation, it is possible to critically explore oppressive and domineering practices of the mainstream culture. It is also possible that the African migrant youth may become equipped with alternative worldviews from an African perspective, which will enable him/her to make informed judgement and response towards inappropriate mainstream attitudes and values. Participation in the arena of cultural politics will therefore be based on informed practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050705.104626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the status of porcine circovirus
in Australia</field><field name="creator">warren.raye@vcp.monash.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis reports for the first time the detection of porcine circovirus virus (PCV) in the Australian pig herd.

PCV DNA was detected in the tissues of pigs from several Australian states using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, the primers for which were based on the sequence of PCV1 and PCV2 strains detected in North America and Europe. PCV type 1 or 2 was detected in 80 of 367 (21.7%) pigs tested. In the 80 positives, both PCV1 and PCV2 were detected in 14 samples. Virus was detected in pigs from all states from which samples were obtained: Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland.

The complete genomes of 13 strains of Australian PCV were sequenced. Analysis of the data indicated there was extremely high homology between the Australian strains of PCV1 and PCV2 and previously published sequences of PCV1 and PCV2 strains from North America and Europe.There were no consistent differences between the genome of the Australian strains and strains in North America and Europe.

The widespread occurrence of PCV in the tissues of pigs was confirmed by a small scale serological study of the Western Australian pig herd using an immunofluorescence assay, which did not discriminate antibody to PCV1 and PCV2. This assay detected PCV antibody in 11 of 14 pig herds in Western Australia, with a prevalence rate in positive herds varying from 25 to 47%, but it was unable to differentiate antibody to PCV1 and PCV2.

A PCV2-specific recombinant viral capsid protein was produced in insect cells with a baculovirus expression system and this was used to develop a PCV2-specific ELISA and a Western immunoblotting assay. These assays were applied to samples from a national pig serum bank and detected PCV2 antibody in 33% of 3933 serum samples. The highest seroprevalence to the recombinant PCV2 capsid antigen was detected in the samples from Victoria where there was a 51.3% seroprevalence rate, and the lowest in Western Australia where there was an 11.4% seroprevalence rate.

An in situ hybridisation (ISH) technique was developed for the detection of PCV in tissues of infected pigs and infected cell cultures. A monoclonal antibody specific for the capsid protein of PCV2 was also produced and has application for the development of immunocytochemical procedures for the detection of PCV2 in tissues and cell cultures.

The high prevalence of PCV in the Australian pig herd and the absence of reports of PMWS suggested that the Australian strains of PMWS detected may have been of low virulence. To examine the pathogenicity of Australian strains, two animal experiments were conducted where the type species of PCV1 present in persistently-infected PK15 pig kidney cells and an Australian PCV2 strain were cultured in vitro in cell cultures and inoculated into weaner pigs. As expected, the PCV1 replicated well in pigs but did not result in the induction of clinical signs or lesions in the inoculated pigs. The inoculation into weaner pigs of cell culture replicated PCV2 with an apparent virus titre of 103 virus particles/mL resulted in infection of only some of the inoculated pigs and it was concluded that the PCV2 inoculum contained insufficient virus to infect all pigs into which it was inoculated. The PCV2 did not induce any disease syndrome and could not be visualised in tissue sections of infected pigs using immunohistochemical techniques.

In conclusion, techniques were developed for the detection of PCV in the Australian pig herd. PCV of both genetic types were detected at prevalence rates similar to those reported in other countries where PMWS has occurred, and the widespread occurrence of PCV was confirmed by serological assays. The PCV strains present were genetically indistinguishable from those present in North America and Europe. The reason for the absence of PMWS in Australia is most likely not due to differences in the characteristics of the PCV strains present.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porcine corcovirus</field><field name="subject">PCV1</field><field name="subject">PCV2</field><field name="subject">PMWS</field><field name="subject">circoviridae</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050705.135219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complete numerical solution of electron-hydrogen collisions</field><field name="creator">bartlett@fizzy.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an extensive computational study of electron-impact scattering and ionisation of atomic hydrogen and hydrogenic ions, which are fundamental to many diverse disciplines, from astrophysics and nuclear fusion to atmospheric physics. The non-relativistic Schrodinger equation describes these collisions, though finding solutions for even hydrogen, the simplest electron-atom collision, has proven to be a monumental task. Recently, Rescigno et al [Science 286, 2474 (1999)] solved this equation in coordinate space using exterior complex scaling (ECS), and presented the first electron-hydrogen differential cross sections for ionisation that matched with experiment without requiring uncontrolled approximation. This method has significant potential for extension to larger collision systems, but its large computational demand has limited its energy range and target configurations, and its application to discrete final-state collisions has been largely unexplored.

Using radically different numerical algorithms, this thesis develops methods that improve the computational efficiency of ECS by two orders of magnitude. It extends the method to calculate discrete final-state scattering cross sections and enhances the target description to include hydrogenic ions and excited initial states. In combination, these developments allow accurate solutions over a broad range of energies and targets, for both scattering and ionisation, including the important near-threshold energy region where accurate calculations have been unavailable. The refined ECS method implemented in this work now offers complete numerical solutions of electron-hydrogen collisions, and its computational efficiency will facilitate its future application to more complex targets. The thesis culminates with the first ab initio quantum mechanical confirmation of ionisation threshold laws for electron-hydrogen collisions [Bartlett and Stelbovics, 2004, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 233201], which have resisted confirmation through the complete solution of the Schrodinger equation for more than half a century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atomic collisions</field><field name="subject">exterior complex scaling</field><field name="subject">electron-hydrogen</field><field name="subject">ionisation threshold laws</field><field name="subject">atomic scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050715.121805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translocations of freshwater crayfish: contributions from life histories, trophic relations and diseases of three species in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">S.Beatty@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">By examining Western Australian freshwater crayfishes, this thesis aims to further our understanding of how life-history strategies, trophic relationships and disease introductions contribute to the threats posed by introduced species.  Reproductive and population biology of two species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Western Australia (the marron Cherax cainii and gilgie Cherax quinquecarinatus) and the introduced yabbie Cherax destructor were described.  Multiple stable isotope analysis was employed to determine the trophic positions of sympatric populations of C. cainii and the invading.  A serious microsporidian disease of freshwater crayfishes was also discovered in a wild population of C. destructor.  These data were used to determine the potential threat that C. destructor poses to the endemic crayfishes of Western Australia.
Cherax cainii supports an iconic recreational fishery that has been in steady decline for three decades.  It is likely that considerable plasticity in the biology of C. cainii exists amongst the ca 100 populations and that this may result in the current fishery management regulations being not effective in protecting all stocks.  To test these hypotheses, the biology of C. cainii were described from populations occurring in an impoundment dam (Lake Navarino) at the approximate centre of its current range and in the Hutt River at the northernmost point of its range and compared with those from a previous study near the southernmost point of its distribution.  The study confirmed these hypotheses.  For example, the onset of spawning was later in the more southerly Lake Navarino population (August) than in the northerly Hutt River population (July).  Furthermore, the respective orbital carapace lengths (OCL) at which C. cainii reached maturity in the two populations studied here differed markedly.  The lengths at which 50% of female and male C. cainii matured in Lake Navarino were 32.1 mm and 28.6 mm OCL for females and males, respectively, compared with 70 mm and 40 mm OCL for females and males in the Hutt River, respectively.  Therefore, these data clearly demonstrate that the current minimum legal size limit of 76 mm CL (~55 mm OCL) is ineffective in allowing females to undertake a spawning event prior to legal capture.  It is therefore recommended that the minimum legal size limit be increased to 98 mm CL in the Hutt River to allow 50% of females to reach maturity prior to exploitation.  Furthermore, as the spawning rate of mature female C. cainii in the Hutt River was low (10%) compared with those mature females in the more southerly Lake Navarino (96%), this increase in minimum legal size of capture is of particular importance should fisheries managers wish this translocated population to be exploited sustainably.
It is proposed that the much larger lengths at first maturity and low spawning rate in the Hutt River were due to faster growth rates likely caused by relatively high water temperatures and in response to competition with the sympatric, introduced crayfish, C. destructor, respectively.  This highlights the plasticity of the biology of C. cainii and has considerable implications for effective management of the size-regulated recreational fishery.
Cherax quinquecarinatus, a south-western Western Australian endemic: occupies a broad range of aquatic systems, is likely to be an important component to those aquatic food webs, and is also subject to recreational fishing pressure.  Cherax quinquecarinatus was found to mature at a relatively small size (cf C. cainii) with the L50s for females and males being 18.8 and 24.5 mm OCL, respectively, with the majority of C. quinquecarinatus first spawning at the end of their second year of life.  The potential (ovarian) and pleopodal fecundities of C. quinquecarinatus were relatively low compared to other freshwater crayfishes, being 81.7 (&#132;b5.93 s.e.) and 77.1 (&#132;b13.76 s.e.), respectively.  Cherax quinquecarinatus underwent an extended spawning period, from late winter to late summer (i.e. August to February).  Three spawning events were facilitated by short brood and rapid gonadal recovery periods, traits consistent with other crayfish species able to exist in temporary environments.  
The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth curve, fitted for the first 14 months of life for female and male C. quinquecarinatus, had respective K and OCL&#132;Vs of 0.29 and 59.6 mm OCL for females, and 0.25 and 73.8 mm OCL for males, respectively.  At 12 months of age, the OCLs of females and males were 14.7 and 14.1 mm, respectively.  Estimates of total mortality (Z) were relatively high at 2.34 and 1.95 year-1 based on an age-converted catch curves for females and males, respectively, with a considerable proportion of this attributed to fishing mortality (exploitation rates of 0.76 and 0.75 for females and males, respectively).  Cherax quinquecarinatus exhibited traits of both an r- and a K-strategist, which has likely to have aided the success of this species across a wide range of permanent and temporary systems. 
During this study, C. destructor was found in many wild aquatic systems in the southern Pilbara and Southwest Coast Drainage Divisions of Western Australia.  This is of great concern as all native freshwater crayfishes in Western Australia are restricted to the southwest while the aquatic systems of the Pilbara Division do not naturally house freshwater crayfish.
Despite the reported impacts that invasive freshwater crayfish species may have on native crayfish species and food webs, the biology and ecology of C. destructor in wild systems in Western Australia was unknown and therefore an assessment of their potential impact has not previously been possible.  Cherax destructor was collected monthly from the Hutt River (Pilbara Drainage Division) for determination of life-history and reproductive biology in a wild aquatic system in Western Australia.  Proliferation in that system was attributed to specific traits including:  a small size at first maturity with 50% (L50) of females and males maturing at 21.6 and 26.5 mm OCL, respectively, a size attained at the end of their first year of life; a protracted spawning period (July to January); high mean ovarian fecundity of 210.2 (&#132;b9.24 s.e.); and a rapid growth rate that was comparable to the larger sympatric C. cainii in this system.  Life-history characteristics of C. destructor in the Hutt River were typical of many other invasive crayfish species and were likely to have aided in its establishment. 
This study is the first to examine the diet and trophic position of sympatric populations of two species of freshwater crayfish in Australia.  By determining temporal changes in the assimilated diet and trophic positions of sympatric populations of C. destructor and C. cainii, this study tested the hypothesis that C. destructor has the potential to compete with C. cainii for food resources.  This was tested using multiple stable isotope analyses with samples of C. cainii, C. destructor and a wide variety of their potential food sources analysed in the Hutt River in summer and winter, 2003.  Summer samples indicated that these species occupied similar predatory trophic positions when their assimilated diet consisted of a large proportion of Gambusia holbrooki (either when the fish were alive or deceased due to a presumably large natural mortality rate).  Although C. cainii continued to assimilate animal matter based on winter signatures, those of C. destructor appeared to shift towards more of herbivorous trophic position.  It appeared that C. destructor and C. cainii were keystone species in the Hutt River and were likely to be important in the cycling of nutrients and in structuring the aquatic food web that may have been considerably altered by their introduction into this system.  
As C. destructor has the ability to switch trophic positions, when an otherwise abundant, high protein food sources (i.e. fish) becomes limited (as was the case in winter in the Hutt River), it was able to co-exist with C. cainii.  Furthermore, the ability of C. destructor to switch from a diet of fish in summer to a predominantly herbivorous/detrital diet in winter suggests that it may compete for food resources with the other smaller native freshwater crayfishes (such as C. quinquecarinatus) in the small, unproductive lotic and lentic systems common to south-western Australia, which often lack fish during summer.  
	The recently described Thelohania parastaci was identified in C. destructor in the Hutt River and Vavraia parastacida, previously recorded from C. cainii and C. quinquecarinatus populations elsewhere in the region, appeared to be infecting C. cainii.  Although not confirmed to have infected C. cainii, the presence of T. parastaci in the sympatric C. destructor is of serious concern as there is the potential that the disease may be able to be transmitted to the native congeners of the region, particularly as C. destructor establishes itself in other natural waterbodies. 
	This thesis has addressed major gaps in the understanding of the biology, ecology and threats to the unique freshwater crayfish fauna of Western Australia.  The results of this research highlight the plasticity of the biology and ecology of freshwater crayfishes and enabled an initial assessment to be made of the potential ecological impacts of an invading species.  Considerable implications for fisheries and other natural resource management agencies ensuing from this research are detailed.  The conclusions drawn from this study are also discussed in the broader context of invasive species in general and important future investigations stemming from these results are identified.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crayfish</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050718.152608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and Income Generating Projects: The Gender Impacts of Indonesian Government</field><field name="creator">prihatin@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Gender inequality and poverty are two serious problems for developing countries
where the majority of women have been victims of the cultural, socio-economic,
political, and environmental impacts of development. The gender dimension of poverty
focuses on the dilemma of women, their multiple roles as women and their roles in
alleviating poverty. The literature on women and poverty abounds with numerous cases
and other evidence of women&#146;s vulnerability and heavier economic and socio-cultural
burden of poverty. Women are also known to be discriminated against in terms of
economic safety, lack of basic needs support, work access, opportunities, and payment.
Despite these factors, women have a greater sense of responsibility and are more
accountable towards sustaining programs designed to alleviate poverty among the poor.
In Indonesia, as elsewhere in the world, micro-credit is being used as a major
vehicle which serves women for improving their wellbeing, reduce vulnerability, and also
as a starter point to empower women. Using findings drawn from a study on the

Indonesian Government policies and the implementation of two particular micro-credit
schemes, namely Tabungan Kesejahteraan Rakyat (Takesra) and Kredit Keluarga
Sejahtera (Kukesra). This thesis explores the two basic and especially important issues of
poverty and women empowerment. Firstly, it views poverty within gender and
sustainability perspectives, and secondly, evaluates the impacts of the micro-credit
schemes under Takesra and Kukesra. The thesis argues that poverty reduction among
women is consistent with the concept of gender and development which is particularly
reinforced within the sustainability agenda. The conditions to do so, however, have
internal and external constraints strongly manifested in the operation of the micro-credit
schemes. The evidence from the empirical research conducted in three districts of Central
Java, Indonesia - namely Brebes, Purbalingga and Cilacap - shows the first type of
constraints to refer to weaknesses of the schemes themselves, such as incomplete and
misdirected indicators for success, small size of available loans and long duration of
repayment terms. The second refers to the socio-economic aspects of sustainability,
including the economic conditions which do not allow market access to poor women and
cultural manipulations which result in overburdens to women. Both diminish the role of
the schemes as a poverty solution.

From the analysis and lessons learned from best practices in other countries, it is

From a social cognitive perspective, motivation research traditionally focuses on factors within the individual, whereas a more situated conceptualisation requires that motivation be studied within a person in context perspective.  This study combines elements of both perspectives.  It is proposed that motivation is shaped at the interface of person and context, where individuals make appraisals of social (other people) and structural (physical or organisational) aspects of their environments.  A holistic view of motivation is adopted that incorporates initial engagement, ongoing involvement and persistence.  

One challenge in current motivation research is to develop appropriate methods to capture such a dynamic, complex construct.  In this study, semi-structured interviews and innovative tasks are used to gather biographical and longitudinal data about high-achieving athletes and musicians from diverse settings.  

The findings reveal that complex personal and contextual factors operate reciprocally and dynamically as individuals make ongoing appraisals of their current situations.  For example, personal factors such as aptitude, and contextual factors such as the existence of community programs, operate in a reciprocal way to shape participants&#146; initial engagement in sport or music.  Complexity is highlighted when examining the role of a unique group of others in sport and music - onlookers (spectators or audience).  A powerful effect on continuing involvement occurs when communities overlap and family members take on roles associated with onlookers.  Participants face a range of potential problems in their lives and there are variations in the way these are perceived, in strategies and resources used, and in their impact on persistence.  An important finding is the dynamic nature of motivation as the nature and extent of participants&#146; involvement in sport or music changes over time.

In addition to deepening our understanding of how motivation is shaped at the interface of person and context, the study offers a unique methodological contribution and the findings have implications for enhancing motivation in applied settings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Athletes</field><field name="subject">Musicians</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050728.140548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transformation of Rhizoctonia solani</field><field name="creator">jiangwu@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop a genetic transformation system for the plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani (teliomorph, Thanatephprus cucumeris Frank [Donk]). The availability of a transformation system would allow us to study gene exchange, epidemiology, and to use techniques such as gene disruption or gene silencing to investigate the role of fungal enzymes in pathogenesis.  

The approach adopted was to use Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transform the fungus as reports in the literature suggested that this was the most efficient and easiest method to use. As a preliminary test, Fusarium oxysporum was transformed using a binary vector (pBINAN) containing a hygromycin resistance gene under control of an ascomycete promoter and terminator. Hygromycin resistant transformants were obtained after co-incubation of fungal conidia with the bacterium. The presence of the transgene was confirmed by analysis of DNA. The number of transformants depended on the genetic background of the A tumefaciens. Strains AGLO or AGRO gave higher numbers of transformants compared to LBA4404. No transformants were obtained when the hygromycin gene was under control of a basidiomycete (pBINHL1), or a plant (CaMV35S) promoter. Since the basidiomycete promoter used in pBINHL1 originates from Ustilago maydis, the vector was tested by transformation of Ustilago cynodontis. Stable transformants of U cynodontis were obtained with this vector.

A series of experiments were carried out on transformation of R. solani mycelium. Both the protoplast and the Agrobacterium transformation methods were tested. Parameters affecting protoplast production and regeneration were examined. Protoplast production varied with the age of the mycelium, with the osmotic stabilizer used, and with time of treatment with protoplasting enzymes. Regeneration of protoplasts was also affected by the osmotic stabilizer and the growth medium. Transformation of several isolates from different anastomosis groups (AG) was attempted by inducing protoplasts to take up DNA using polyethyleneglycol. Two plasmids were used; (1) pAN7-1 containing the resistance gene under control of an ascomycete promoter, and (2) pHL-1 in which the resistance gene is under control of a basidiomycete promoter. No transformants were obtained.

Attempts were then made to transform mycelium and protoplasts using A tumefaciens. The experiments used both mycelium and protoplasts as the recipient.  A number of small resistant colonies were obtained using binary plasmid (pBINHL1) in which mycelium was transformed with the resistance gene was driven by the basidiomycete promoter. On transfer to fresh medium these colonies would grow to about 2cm diameter, and then stop growing. On a second transfer to fresh medium they failed to show any growth. No resistant colonies were obtained from A. tumefaciens transformation of  protoplasts. 

To improve transformation efficiency, a vector was constructed in which the hygromycin resistance gene was fused to an R solani laccase promoter sequence. No resistant colonies were obtained using this vector. Further experiments were carried out using a hygromycin resistance gene specially modified for expression in basidiomycetes by the insertion of artificial introns in the 5&#146; and 3&#146; untranslated regions, and a number of AT to CG conversions in the coding region. Most of the recipient isolates gave transformants with the unstable resistance phenotype. However, one AG 6 isolate gave transformants with a stable resistance phenotype. Of six transformants recovered from this isolate, five were shown by PCR and southern blotting to contain the transgene. In four of these transformants the resistance phenotype was stable in the absence of selection.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizoctonia</field><field name="subject">Solani</field><field name="subject">teliomorph</field><field name="subject">genetic transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050728.141653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Families of Meaning: Dismantling the Boundaries Between Law and Society</field><field name="creator">tsummerf@law.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Legal positivism insists upon a distinction between the inside and outside of law. The common law and statutory rules of interpretation assist in maintaining this distinction, establishing the myth that legal decision-making is a purely objective and rational process, giving rise to internal truths. While critical theorists have illustrated the ways in which the lines between the inside and outside are always blurred, there remains a perceived distinction, in law, between the interpretation of concepts that occurs in the law and that which occurs outside the law. Only the former have legal legitimacy. The idea of the legal family is a case in point, where the law defines family according to its own prescriptions irrespective of how family is constituted by non-legal communities. In this thesis, I consider the meanings of family in different spheres to show how the lines between the social, the political and the legal consistently overlap. I then develop a mechanism by which the law can acknowledge and affirm that which is &#145;outside&#146;. This requires, firstly, a conception of law as communication and of legal interpretation as a constructive process. Secondly, the task demands that jurists engage with the semiotic processes of the everyday and that legal concepts, at least those that exist independently of the law (family for example) be framed with an open indexicality. This might enable such concepts to be interpreted according to a range of contexts, other than (or in addition to) the legal one. Finally, using the family as an example, I illustrate how a semiotic approach can assist legal interpretation, reform and analysis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">family law</field><field name="subject">semiotics</field><field name="subject">legal interpretation</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050810.115925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising the Gift through Visual Culture</field><field name="creator">kelli.fuery@arts.monash.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the gift in terms of presence and interpretation using varied examples of image that form a visual culture. It contextualises the term "giftness" by analysing its use and our socio-cultural understanding of its function as it relates to the gift process. The hermeneutic processes attached to both the gift, and gifting, are multifarious and require examination of moments of instability present in the act of interpretation and meaning. The gift relationship is juxtaposed against the relationship between image and reader/observer to highlight the abstract quality of the gift and its inherent instability that exists within gift interpretation in general.

The fundamental structure and unity of the gift, as is based upon relations between subjects, helps to identify and analyse systems of power and subjectivity developed in terms of investment in order to emphasise the complexities that arise through inter-subjective relations, particularly gift exchange, and those between subject and image. Certain theoretical models help to exemplify and illuminate this thesis, predominantly post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories. The gift&#146;s condition of instability is further examined in terms of discursive formation and function, looking at how the gift is enunciated so that one can recognise a gift and giving, and acknowledge its problematic status. The relationship between subject and image is investigated to see if we are able to read this investment as a gift relationship within the context of giftness, that is when giftness operates as an instable and challenging element to discursive exchange in visual mediums such as film, painting, television, art and photography. An examination of the gift aporia in this thesis is directed towards a subject&#146;s investment in the image. What transpires between subject and image is akin to what circulates between giver and receiver, on the basis of investment. On this basis, the present configuration of giftness is utilised in terms of the image.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gift</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">visual culture</field><field name="subject">film theory</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050810.131444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular markers, analysis and the population genetics of parasites</field><field name="creator">Constantine@wehi.edu.au</field><field name="description">In this study different molecular techniques are contrasted (RAPD's, allozyme, sequencing mtDNA, sequencing ribosomal spacers) and appropriate analytical methods (allelic and infinite-sites approaches; inbreeding and coalescent models) used for estimating population genetic parameters in parasites. A range of population genetic questions at different scales were chosen to emphasise the importance of tailoring techniques and analytical methods to the particular question being investigated. 

The realisation that each question formulated has a particular scale means the appropriate technique and markers must be useful at that scale to attempt to answer the question. The useful scale of a technique depends several factors including the region of DNA examined, the density of sampling of the technique, and the mode of evolution of the markers. Each technique will produce a useful range of variability. Below the lower limit there is no variation, above the upper limit the variation is too high to produce useful comparisons.

Parasites are of interest for many reasons, primarily because they can cause disease and thus impact on their host's population dynamics. They are often closely associated with their hosts and may undergo co-evolution, as well as causing an ongoing immunological "arms race" with their hosts. The parasitic mode of live is found throughout nearly all taxonomic groupings and thus classical models of population genetics based on sexual, diploid vertebrates do not fit well with the entire diversity of parasite groups.

Genetic diversity within and among populations of Echinococcus granulosus was examined contrasting a RAPD dataset with an allozyme dataset. Two models of variation in Echinococcus have been proposed, those of Smyth and Rausch, and the expected genetic structure from each was compared to the observed genetic structure. The premise of Smyth&#146;s model, predominant self-fertilisation, was supported, but the resultant pattern of genetic variation followed Rausch&#146;s model. 

RAPD data, being dominant, present challenges to analysis. An approach to overcome this dominance problem and allow standard allelic frequency analysis is described using the selfing rate estimated from allozyme data. The RAPD data were also analysed using both band-sharing and nucleotide diversity approaches. 

A population genetic study of Ostertagia ostertagi in the USA was extended to two different scales: within an Australian state and between the USA and Australian continents. Three alternative explanations for the observed discrepancy between genetic structure and differentiation in an important biological trait, hypobiosis, were explored. A number of programs and analyses were compared including coalescent geneflow estimates.

Variation among multiple copies of two spacer regions of rDNA was examined within individuals of Ostertagia ostertagi. Both the intergenic spacer and internal transcribed spacer 1 regions were found to include repeat regions, with different numbers of repeats creating length differences in clones from the same worm. Multi-copy genes present extra challenges in analysis to ensure that only homologous copies are being compared. Many studies fail to look for variation within populations or within individuals.

The two major conclusions from these examples are that:

1). The study of variation necessarily involves an implicit scale, and markers must be chosen that are appropriate to the question being explored. 

2). Using several methods of analysis of genetic data allows contrasts to be made, and if different methods produce similar results gives much more confidence in the conclusions drawn. Incongruence in results leads to new questions and reexamination of the assumptions of each analysis.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">ostertagia ostertagi</field><field name="subject">echinococcus granulosus</field><field name="subject">molecular techniques</field><field name="subject">gene flow</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050817.102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Detailed Performance Comparison of PV Modules of Different Technologies and the Implications for PV System Design Methods</field><field name="creator">A.carr@aip.org.au</field><field name="description">In designing any power generation system that incorporates photovoltaics (PV) there is a basic requirement to accurately estimate the output from the proposed PV array under operating conditions. PV modules are given a power rating at standard test conditions(STC) of 1000Wm-2, AM1.5 and a module temperature of 25 &#176;C, but these conditions do not represent what is typically experienced under outdoor operation.

It is well known that different PV technologies have different seasonal patterns of behaviour. These differences are due to the variations in spectral response, the different temperature coefficients of voltage and current and, in the case of amorphous silicon (a-Si) modules, the extra effect of photo-degradation and thermal annealing.

In this study a novel method has been used to obtain highly accurate energy output data
from six different PV modules representing five different technologies:
Single crystal silicon (c-Si).
Poly-crystalline silicon (p-Si) (2 modules).
Triple junction amorphous silicon (3j, a-Si).
Copper indium diselenide (CIS).

Laser grooved buried contact (LGBC, c-Si) crystalline silicon.

This data set includes all the associated meteorological parameters and back-of-module temperatures.

The monitoring system allows the simultaneous measurement of six different modules under long-term outdoor operation, which in turn allows a direct comparison of the performance of the modules.

Each of the modules has been deployed for at least one year, which provides useful information about the seasonal behaviour of each technology.

This data set ultimately provides system designers and consumers with valuable information on the expected output of these different module types in climates like that of Perth, Western Australia.

The second part of the study uses the output data collected to assess and compare output predictions made by some currently available photovoltaic performance prediction tools or methods. These range from a generalised approach, as used in the Australian Standards, to the commercially available software packages that employ radiation, thermal and PV models of varying complexities. The results of these evaluations provide very valuable information, to PV consumers, about how complex PV output prediction tools need to be to give acceptable results.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photovoltaics</field><field name="subject">pv</field><field name="subject">solar energy</field><field name="subject">outdoor performance</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050830.94641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining a Common Arbitrary Unit in Social Measurement</field><field name="creator">Stephen.Humphry@det.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">In educational assessment, it is common to equate test forms in order to draw comparisons between different populations of students.   The process of test equating presents a number of challenges, many of which relate inherently to the problem of maintaining a common unit and origin.
In order to develop a general theoretical approach to maintaining a common unit and origin in the measurement of quantitative attributes, the role of the unit is carefully examined.  Classical physics is explicitly adopted as the guiding paradigm during the investigations throughout the dissertation.  Accordingly, the central objective is to develop a theoretical foundation for maintaining a common unit and origin which meets two criteria: (i) it must be congruent with the definition of measurement in physics captured in the classical theory of measurement (Michell, 1999); and (ii) it must meet a key requirement of measurement in the physical sciences identified by Rasch (1960/1980).  Rasch identified the relevant requirement, that of invariant comparison, based on analysis of Newton&#146;s second law and showed that the Principle of Invariant Comparison is formally embodied in his measuring function for dichotomous data (Rasch, 1960/1980).  This model provides the basis for the development and exposition of general concepts and principles in the dissertation.
In order to achieve the central objective, the unit is made formally explicit and specified in relation to the experimental frame of reference.  Rasch (1977) defined a Specified Frame of Reference (SFR) in terms of a collection of objects, a collection of agents, and outcomes of the interaction between these.  Drawing on a fundamental distinction introduced by Andrich (2003), the unit of a SFR is referred to as a natural unit and is distinguished from an arbitrary unit, the magnitude of which is theoretically independent of any particular SFR and instrument contained within.  From this distinction, a definition of discrimination arises naturally; a definition that is also congruent with classical physics.  The distinction and related definitions provide the basis for derivation of a general form of Rasch&#146;s measuring function for dichotomous data, referred to as the Extended Frame of Reference Model (EFRM).  It is shown that the EFRM provides a rational basis for maintaining a common unit and origin in assessment contexts involving two or more Specified Frames of Reference.
Simulation and empirical studies are employed to illustrate application of the EFRM.  These studies also serve to illustrate that quantitative hypotheses entailed by the EFRM are open to empirical tests by providing a context for the use of graphical methods and statistical tests of fit.  Empirical investigations are used to illustrate consequences of differences between natural units in the context of applied educational assessment.  The studies also provide a context in which to characterise the model, and the structure of data that it entails.  Although the simulation studies demonstrate the basic efficacy of the model, they also indicate scope for improvement in terms of the precision of estimates.  To explore possible approaches to refining the estimation process, Maximum Likelihood (ML) equations are derived and examined.  Firstly, Joint Maximum Likelihood (JML) equations are presented.  Following this, Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CML) equations are derived.  It is shown that while the CML equations permit separation of the person and item parameters, item locations are expressed in terms of natural, rather than arbitrary, units.  A particular approach is proposed, emphasising links to the classical theory and the Principle of Invariant Comparison.  In considering the proposed approach, a distinguishing feature of the definition of discrimination is highlighted: specifically, the nature of its definition represents the importance of relationships between quantitative attributes, and the specific structure of these relationships, to the measurement of any particular attribute.  Although it is not possible to fully study this feature given the scope of the work, it is a key to the implications of the general theoretical framework embodied in the EFRM.  Accordingly, these implications are touched on before concluding the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050830.95143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The culture of coccolithophorid algae for carbon dioxide bioremediationn</field><field name="creator">n_moheimani@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The culture of coccolithophorid algae is an attractive option for sequestration or
recycling of CO2 as they can fix carbon by photosynthesis as well as in calcium
carbonate scales known as coccoliths. They also produce high amounts of lipids which
have a potential application as a renewable fuel.
Five species of coccolithophorids (Pleurochrysis carterae, CCMP647, Pleurochrysis sp.
CCMP1211, Gephyrocapsa oceanica CS-335/2, Emiliania huxleyi CCMP371, and
Emiliania huxleyi CS-369) were screened for their ability to grow at high temperature.
All species grew up to 28oC except E. huxleyi CS-369. However, Pleurochrysis sp.
CCMP 1211 which was found to clump and can therefore not be recommended for
large-scale cultivation. The salinity tolerance of these species was also examined.
Growth of P. carterae, G. oceanica, and E. huxleyi in laboratory scale closed
photobioreactors (plate, carboy, airlift, and tubular photobioreactors) showed the plate
photobioreactor to be the best closed cultivation system. The highest productivities
were achieved by P. carterae in the plate photobioreactor and were 0.54 g.L-1.d-1, 0.12
g.L-1.d-1, 0.06 g.L-1.d-1 for total dry weight, lipid and CaCO3 respectively.
The growth of P. carterae and E. huxleyi was also examined in an outdoor raceway
pond. The E. huxleyi culture was easily contaminated resulting in the loss of the culture
in less than three weeks, but P. carterae grew well over a period of 13 months. The
overall total dry weight productivity of P. carterae was 0.19 g.L-1.d-1 with lipid and
CaCO3 contents of up to 33% and 10% of dry weight respectively. There was little
protozoan and bacterial contamination. Medium pH increased to pH 11 during the day
and was found to be a reliable variable for maintaining the health of the culture. A
maximum pH achieved during the day of less than pH 8.5 indicated the imminent collapse of the culture. Heavy rain and low temperature were the main reasons for
culture loss in mid winter, whereas high temperature during summer favoured P.
carterae growth. A comparison of the growth of P. carterae and Dunaliella salina
MUR8 in the raceway ponds showed no significant differences between these two
species with regard to areal total dry weight productivity and lipid content.
The effects of several limiting factors were also examined. A reduction in medium pH
resulting from CO2 addition inhibited the growth of E. huxleyi in the plate
photobioreactor, whereas P. carterae growth and productivities increased in the pH
range of pH 7.7 to 8.0 in the plate photobioreactor and pH 9.1 to 9.6 in the outdoor
raceway pond. The best operational pond depth for outdoor raceway culture of P.
carterae was between 16 cm and 21 cm. Early morning temperatures, especially during
the winter, highly affected the growth of P. carterae in the raceway pond, whereas
artificially increasing the medium temperature improved the health of the culture but
resulted in little increase in productivity. Photosynthesis of P. carterae was found to be
highly inhibited by high oxygen concentration in the medium irrespective of
temperature or irradiance.
An economic model of P. carterae in a 63 ha raceway plant resulted in a cost for the
biomass of between 7.35 Aus$.Kg-1 and 14.17 Aus$.Kg-1 depending on the harvesting
method used.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro algae</field><field name="subject">photobioreactor</field><field name="subject">algal calcificaton</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050901.140745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and Evaluation of Novel Potential
Target (Tubulin) for Antimalarial Chemotherapy</field><field name="creator">low@wehi.edu.au</field><field name="description">Malaria has long affected the world both socially and economically. Annually, there
are 1.5-2.7 million deaths and 300-500 million clinical infections (WHO, 1998).
Several antimalarial agents (such as chloroquine, quinine, pyrimethamine,
cycloguanil, sulphadoxine and others) have lost their effectiveness against this
disease through drug resistance being developed by the malarial parasites (The-
Wellcome-Trust, 1999). Although there is no hard-core evidence of drug resistance
shown on the new antimalarial compounds (artemisinin and artesunate), induced
resistant studies in animal models have demonstrated that the malarial parasites have
capabilities to develop resistance to these compounds (Ittarat et al., 2003; Meshnick,
1998; Meshnick, 2002; Walker et al., 2000). Furthermore, a useful vaccine has yet
to be developed due to the complicated life cycle of the malarial parasites (The-
Wellcome-Trust, 1999). As such, the re-emergence of this deadly infectious disease
has caused an urgent awareness to constantly look for novel targets and compounds.
In this present study, Plasmodium falciparum (clone 3D7) was cultured in vitro in
human red blood cells for extraction of total RNA which was later reverse
transcribed into cDNA. The &#225;I-, &#225;II- and &#226;-tubulin genes of the parasite were then
successfully amplified and cloned into a bacterial protein expression vector, pGEX-
6P-1. The tubulin genes were then sequenced and analysed by comparison with
previously published homologues. It was found that the sequenced gene of &#225;Itubulin
was different at twelve bases, of which only six of these had resulted in
changes in amino acid residues. &#225;II- and &#226;-tubulin genes demonstrated 100%
sequence similarity with the published sequences of clone 3D7, but differences were
observed between this clone and other strains (strains NF54 &amp; 7G8) of &#226;-tubulin.
Nevertheless, the differences were minor in &#225;I- and &#226;-tubulins and there was greater
than 99% homology. Subsequently, all three Plasmodium recombinant tubulin
proteins were separately expressed and purified. Insoluble aggregates (inclusion
bodies) of these recombinant tubulins were also refolded and have been tested
positive for their structural characteristics in Western blot analysis.
Both soluble and refolded recombinant tubulins of malaria were examined in a drugtubulin
interaction study using sulfhydryl reactivity and fluorescence quenching
techniques. Known tubulin inhibitors (colchicine, tubulozole-c and vinblastine) and
novel synthetic compounds (CCWA-110, 239 and 443) were used as the drug
compounds to determine the dynamics and kinetics of the interactions. In addition,
mammalian tubulin was also used to determine the potential toxicity effects of these
compounds. Similarities were observed with other published reports in the binding
of colchicine with the recombinant tubulins, hence confirming proposed binding sites
of this compound on the Plasmodium recombinant tubulins. Two synthetic
compounds (CCWA-239 and 443) that have previously tested positive against P.
falciparum in vitro were found to bind effectively with all three tubulin monomers,
while displaying low binding interactions with the mammalian tubulin, thus
indicating that these compounds have potential antimalarial activity. Therefore, this
study has satisfied and fulfilled all the aims and hypotheses that have previously
been stated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tubulin</field><field name="subject">plasmodium falciparum</field><field name="subject">malaria</field><field name="subject">drug interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20050930.125714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthur William Upfield: A Biography</field><field name="creator">TLindsey@aapt.net.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an exhaustive account of the life and work of Arthur William Upfield (1890-1964). It is presented as a critical biography and narrates the life of the writer, in his socio-cultural milieu, from birth. It also positions Upfield as a writer who dealt with issues of Aboriginality at a time when this was a singularly polemical subject. My work is informed by the theory of Zygmunt Bauman and others and is posited in the context of late-modern biography theory. 

English-born, Upfield arrived in Australia in 1911 and took work in the bush, serving overseas with the Australian army at the outbreak of World War I and marrying an Australian army nurse in Egypt. Returning with his wife and son to Australia in 1921 he intermittently carried his swag until he was employed patrolling the Western Australian number 1 rabbit-proof fence for three years to 1931. By that time he had published four novels, including two crime novels featuring his fictional creation, the part-Aboriginal, part-European, Detective-Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (&#147;Bony&#148;), arguably the first fully-developed character in Australian popular fiction.

Leaving the fence, Upfield settled with his family in Perth and wrote full-time until joining the Melbourne Herald in 1933. Retrenched, he resumed career writing to be further interrupted by a war-time intelligence posting in 1939. In 1943 the first Bony mysteries were published in America, where Upfield&#146;s critical success was maintained until his death. In 1945 he left his wife for Jessica Uren, to whom he remained devoted.

Upfield&#146;s in all twenty-nine Bony novels, many of which have been translated across eleven languages, afforded him notable success both at home and abroad, in good part due to his descriptive gifts and the uniqueness of his fictional character, the part-Aboriginal Bony.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">upfield</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051003.113934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of a Resin-in-pulp Process for the Recovery of Nickel and Cobalt from Laterite Leach Slurries</field><field name="creator">Zzainol@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The processing of laterite ores for the recovery of nickel and cobalt has increased as the

current decantation (CCD) circuit after pressure leaching has resulted in as much as
10% of the soluble nickel and cobalt reporting to the tailings. The objective of this
project is the development of an alternative processing step for the recovery of soluble
nickel and cobalt from the PAL tailings using resin-in-pulp (RIP) technology.
Commercially available chelating resins with the iminodiacetate functional group have
been studied for their suitability for the adsorption of nickel and other metal ions from
PAL tailings pulp. The Amberlite IRC 748 resin was found to be superior despite its
lower nominal loading capacity. The resin with the highest nominal capacity was
observed to adsorb less nickel as a result of the adsorption of greater amounts of the
impurity ions. The equilibrium loading for nickel on the preferred resin was found to be
similar from the ammonium and protonated form of the resin although the kinetics of
adsorption is greater when the resin is initially in the ammonium form.
A comprehensive study has been made of the equilibrium adsorption of several metal
ions on the resin as a function of the equilibrium pH of the solution. A relatively simple
model of the equilibrium adsorption which includes the effect of pH has been developed
ii
and the results compared with the experimental data obtained in the M2+/Na+/H+ system.
The model which requires two equilibrium constants has been found to fairly well
describe the experimental results.
A study of the kinetics of the loading of nickel and cobalt from both solutions and pulp
has shown that the rate can be described in terms of a first-order approach to
equilibrium. The kinetic and equilibrium parameters were used to simulate the
performance of a multi-stage counter current resin-in-pulp operation A semiquantitative
study of the elution of the adsorbed metal ions from the resin by dilute
sulphuric acid solutions was also undertaken.
The technical feasibility of the RIP process for the recovery of nickel and cobalt from
the PAL tailings has been successfully demonstrated in both laboratory and pilot-plant
studies using a five-stage adsorption process. Important parameters such as the
operating pH and the residence times of pulp and resin in each stage were identified
through the batch test work coupled to the simulation procedure.
The optimum pH for adsorption was found to be in the range 4 to 5 as this pH is high
enough to maximise the adsorption of nickel and cobalt while preventing precipitation
of nickel and cobalt as hydroxides from the pulp. A method for minimizing the
competition from more strongly loaded ions such as iron(II) and chromium(III) which
are present in the pulp was also developed in the initial laboratory phase of the project
and utilized during the pilot operation.
Problems associated with the preparation of the pulp preparation, elution of the loaded
resin and control of the adsorption train were resolved during several pilot plant runs on
site at a local PAL plant. These and other minor improvements and adjustments to the
operating procedure culminated in a successful continuous run for several days during
which the target recovery of 90% for nickel and 60% for cobalt was exceeded
throughout the run.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resin in pulp</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051004.114504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and Hydrology of a Threatened Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystem:The Jewel Cave Karst System in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Stefan@calm.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Groundwater is a significant component of the world's water balance and accounts for
&gt;90 % of usable freshwater. Around the world groundwater is an important source of
water for major cities, towns, industries, agriculture and forestry. Groundwater plays a
role in the ecological processes and 'health' of many surface ecosystems, and is the
critical habitat for subterranean aquatic animals (stygofauna). Over-abstraction or
contamination of groundwater resources may imperil the survival of stygofauna and
other groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs). In two karst areas in Western
Australia (Yanchep and Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge), rich stygofauna communities
occur in cave waters containing submerged tree roots. These aquatic root mat
communities were listed as critically endangered because of declining groundwater
levels, presumably caused by lower rainfall, groundwater abstraction, and/or forest
plantations. Investigation of the hydrology and ecology of the cave systems was
considered essential for the conservation and recovery of these threatened ecological
communities (TECs). This thesis investigated the hydrology and ecology of one of the
TECs, located in the Jewel Cave karst system in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge. A
multi-disciplinary approach was used to explore aspects pertinent to the hydrology and
ecology of the groundwater system.

Thermoluminescence dating of the limestone suggested that development of the karst
system dates from the Early Pleistocene and that caves have been available for
colonisation by groundwater fauna since that time. Speleogenesis of the watertable
maze caves occurred in a flank margin setting during earlier periods of wetter climate
and/or elevated base levels. Field mapping and leveling were used to determine
hydrologic relationships between caves and the boundaries of the karst aquifer.
Monitoring of groundwater levels was undertaken to characterise the conditions of
recharge, storage, flow and discharge. A hydrogeologic model of the karst system was
developed.

The groundwater hydrograph for the last 50 years was reconstructed from old
photographs and records whilst radiometric dating and leveling of stratigraphic horizons
enabled reconstruction of a history of watertable fluctuations spanning the Holocene to
Late Pleistocene. The watertable fluctuations over the previous 50 years did not exceed the range of fluctuations experienced in the Quaternary history, including a period
11,000 to 13,000 years ago when the watertable was lower than the present level.

The recent groundwater decline in Jewel Cave was not reflected in the annual rainfall
trend, which was above average during the period (1 976 to 1988) when the major drop
in water levels occurred. Groundwater abstraction and tree plantations in nearby
catchments have not contributed to the groundwater decline as previously suggested.
The period of major watertable decline coincided with a substantial reduction in fire
frequency within the karst catchment. The resultant increase in understorey vegetation
and ground litter may have contributed to a reduction in groundwater recharge, through
increased evapotranspiration and interception of rainfall. To better understand the
relationships between rainfall, vegetation and fire and their effects on groundwater
recharge, an experiment is proposed that involves a prescribed burn of the cave
catchment with before-after monitoring of rainfall, leaf-area, ground litter, soil moisture,
vadose infiltration and groundwater levels.

Molecular genetic techniques (allozyrne electrophoresis and mitochondria1 DNA) were
used to assess the species and population boundaries of two genera and species of cave
dwelling Amphipoda. Populations of both species were largely panrnictic which was
consistent with the hydrogeologic model. The molecular data supported the conclusion
that both species of amphipod have survived lower watertable levels experienced in the
caves during the Late Pleistocene. A mechanism for the colonization and isolation of
populations in caves is proposed.

Multi Dimensional Scaling was used to investigate patterns in groundwater biodiversity
including species diversity, species assemblages, habitat associations and biogeography.
Faunal patterns were related to abiotic environmental parameters. Investigation of
hydrochemistry and water quality characterized the ecological water requirements
(EWR) of the TEC and established a baseline against which to evaluate potential
impacts such as groundwater pollution.

The conservation status of the listed TEC was significantly improved by increasing the
number of known occurrences and distribution range of the community (from 10 m2 to &gt;
2 x lo6 m2), and by showing that earlier perceived threatening processes (rainfall
decline, groundwater pumping, tree plantations) were either ameliorated or inoperative
within this catchment. The GDE in the Jewel Cave karst system may not have been
endangered by the major phase of watertable decline experienced 1975-1987, or by the
relatively stable level experienced up until 2000. However, if the present trend of
declining rainfall in southwest Wester,,Australia continues, and the cave watertable
declines &gt; 0.5 m below the present level, then the GDE may become more vulnerable to
extinction.

The occurrence and distribution of aquatic root mat communities and related
groundwater fauna in other karst catchments in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge is
substantially greater than previously thought, however some of these are predicted to be
threatened by groundwater pumping and pollution associated with increasing urban and
rural developments. The taxonomy of most stygofauna taxa and the distribution of root
mat communities is too poorly known to enable proper assessment of their conservation
requirements. A regional-scale survey of stygofauna in southwest Western Australia is
required to address this problem. In the interim, conservation actions for the listed TECs
need to be focused at the most appropriate spatial scale, which is the karst drainage
system and catchment area. Conservation of GDEs in Western Australia will benefit
fi-om understanding and integration with abiotic groundwater system processes,
especially hydrogeologic and geomorphic processes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stygofauna</field><field name="subject">caves</field><field name="subject">karst</field><field name="subject">groundwater dependant ecosystem</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051010.141551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for Financial Instruments: An Investigation of Preparer and User Preference for Fair Value Accounting</field><field name="creator">Rebecca.tan@anu.edu.au</field><field name="description">This research study, motivated by the difference in opinion between the Joint Working Group of Standard Setters (JWGSS) and the Joint Working Group of Banking Associations (JWGBA), generates empirical evidence on preparer and user preferences for fair value accounting for all financial instruments. Australian and Singaporean respondents&#146; perceptions on the measurement of financial instruments at fair value and the recognition of changes in fair value as gains or losses in the Income Statement are obtained. This study provides better understanding of the perceptions on the international proposals for change by examining possible explanatory factors for respondents&#146; views. 
There is ongoing controversy regarding the appropriate accounting for financial instruments. Perceived shortcomings of the mixed measurement model resulted in an all inclusive fair value accounting standard proposed by the JWGSS (2000). This was met with strong criticism from the JWGBA, established in response to this proposal (1999a). An understanding of actual preparer and user views is thus important for standard-setters to determine the most appropriate and acceptable accounting standard for financial instruments, particularly for the complex financial institutions industry in these two prominent financial markets of the Asian Pacific region. 
A positivist-objectivist approach is chosen as the theoretical perspective of this research study because of its ability to help explain real world phenomena. Both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (surveys) methods are used in tandem to derive evidence on user and preparer perceptions. This integration of methods is important to achieve a better understanding of the issues at hand. Evidence collected from the interviews and the preparer and user surveys are analysed with univariate and multivariate statistical tools to determine the level of support (or opposition) for fair value accounting for all financial instruments and to identify factors that explain user and preparer views.  
Results show that on average, preparers neither strongly support nor strongly oppose the fair value accounting proposal, while users are slightly more supportive.  However, respondent users and preparers tend to have similar perceptions on most of the contentious issues raised in this international debate, sometimes giving credence to the JWGBA position while other times agreeing with the JWGSS. On average, users and preparer responses are similar but there is substantial variation within each group. Findings indicate higher support for fair value accounting when the trading and banking books are perceived to be not different, fair values for non-traded financial instruments are reliable and when there is comparability across entities.  
This thesis generates empirical evidence on the highly topical issue of accounting for financial instruments in the midst of international accounting standard setting movements toward fair value accounting. The lack of variation between users and preparers affirms the robustness of the qualitative characteristics espoused by the IASB framework for financial reporting. Results show that achieving these qualitative characteristics is far more important than trying to fulfill the different needs of various groups. This slight support for fair value accounting is part of a bigger tapestry of a slow but steady movement towards fair value measurement in financial accounting and reporting.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fair value accounting</field><field name="subject">financial instruments</field><field name="subject">financial institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051011.123944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Analysis of the HOX11 Target Genes ALDH1A1 and FHL1</field><field name="creator">Kim.Rice@mssm.edu</field><field name="description">HOX11 is a developmental regulator that plays a crucial role in the normal development
of the spleen and is also aberrantly activated by the t(10;14)(q24;q11) and variant
t(7;10)(q35;q24) translocations in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (TALLs).
The recent finding that HOX11 is deregulated in up to 40% of childhood TALLs
when abnormalities not detected by cytogenetics are included, suggests that the
over-expression of HOX11 and subsequent deregulation of downstream target genes are
critical events in the progression of this tumour type. To date, three candidate HOX11
target genes have been reported, two of which are Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1a1
(ALDH1A1) and Four and a Half LIM domain Protein 1 (FHL1). This investigation
focused on two aspects of HOX11 function, namely its roles as a transcriptional
regulator and as a nuclear oncoprotein capable of inducing neoplastic transformation.
More specifically, we sought to further understand the role of HOX11 in tumorigenesis
by 1) Confirming target gene status of ALDH1A1 and FHL1 by assessing whether their
proximal promoter regions are transcriptionally regulated by HOX11, 2) Investigating
the regulatory elements/transcriptional complexes involved in the response of
ALDH1A1 to HOX11 in both a T-cell and an erythroid cell line in order to gain an
insight into the mechanism(s) responsible for mediating a HOX11 activity and 3)
Assessing the ability of ALDH1A1 and FHL1 to perturb normal patterns of
haematopoiesis, on the basis that the transforming capabilities of HOX11 are thought to
derive from its ability to affect haematopoietic cell differentiation.

To confirm ALDH1A1 and FHL1 as target genes, they were both characterised in terms
of the ability of their proximal promoters to be transcriptionally regulated by HOX11
using luciferase reporter assays. Significant repression of the proximal promoters of
ALDH1A1 and FHL1 by HOX11 was observed in PER-117 T-cells which provided
further evidence for their status as target genes. In the case of ALDH1A1, a CCAAT box
(-74/-70bp) was identified as the primary cis-regulatory element involved in ALDH1A1
transcription and repression by HOX11 appeared to occur, either directly or indirectly,
via interactions at the CCAAT box. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the
disruption of a specific complex at this site by HOX11, which also altered the formation
of complexes at a non-canonical TATA box (a GATA box at -34/-29bp). Significantly,
HOX11 was shown to have the potential to interact with TFIIB, a member of the basal
transcriptional complex. This, together with the presence of a TFIIB responsive element
immediately 5&#146; of the GATA box, suggested that HOX11 may repress transcription by
interfering with members of a preinitiation complex on the ALDH1A1 promoter. The
transcriptional repression by HOX11 demonstrated in T-cells was dependent on DNA
binding helix 3 of the homeodomain, suggesting that repression may require DNA
binding. Alternatively, this region may be required for stable protein-protein
interactions. In support of this, the in vitro association of HOX11 with TFIIB was
disrupted upon deletion of helix 3, and the HOX11&#8710;H3 mutant switched from a
transcriptional repressor to a potent activator of transcription. Together, this data
supports a model whereby HOX11 represses transcription by interfering with activation
complexes at the CCAAT box and at the GATA box possibly via protein-protein
interactions involving the homeodomain helix 3, whereas deletion of the region disables
repressor-specific interactions, resulting in potent activation by HOX11.

Luciferase reporter gene assays investigating the response of nested deletions of the
ALDH1A1 promoter to HOX11 in the HEL900 erythroleukaemic cell line, also
identified the CCAAT box (-74/-70bp) as the primary cis-regulatory element involved
in ALDH1A1 transcription. However, in stark contrast to the its effect in T-cells,
HOX11 was shown to activate transcription in the HEL cell line, both from the empty
pGL3Basic luciferase reporter vector and from the ALDH1A1 promoter, in a manner
independent of the homeodomain DNA binding helix 3. HOX11 thus appears to be a
dichotomous regulator, capable of both transcriptional activation and repression
depending on the circumstances. The mechanisms underlying these two functions are
also appear to be distinct, with repression but not activation requiring the presence of
homeodomain helix 3.

ALDH1A1 encodes an enzyme involved in the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde
to the biologically active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA) and appears to be
physiologically regulated by Hox11 in the developing spleen. Since RA is a potent
modulator of cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, the dysregulation of
RA synthesis is likely to have severe consequences for the cell and may constitute a
mechanism whereby overexpression of HOX11 predisposes T-cells to malignant transformation.
FHL1 also appears to have potential relevance to tumorigenesis, given
that it encodes protein isoforms with suspected roles in transcriptional regulation. As a
starting point to investigate a possible link between these HOX11 target genes and
leukaemogenesis, the effect of overexpressing ALDH1A1 and FHL1 on murine
haematopoiesis was assessed following reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice with
retrovirally-transduced primary murine bone marrow cells. The enforced expression of
ALDH1A1 in bone marrow was associated with a marked increase in myelopoiesis and a
decrease in B and T-lymphopoiesis. By contrast, overexpression of FHL1 was not
associated with perturbations in myelopoiesis or lymphopoiesis, although a slight
increase in erythropoiesis was observed in the bone marrow. While further work is
required to clarify the possible oncogenic roles of both of these HOX11 target genes,
these findings have served to identify ALDH1A1 in particular, as a gene which could
potentially be involved in HOX11-mediated tumorigenesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HOX11</field><field name="subject">T-ALL</field><field name="subject">ALDH1A1</field><field name="subject">FHL1</field><field name="subject">promoter</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051012.93820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intensification of Single Stage Continuously Stirred Tank Anaerobic Digestion Process using Carriers</field><field name="creator">herabudi@plasa.com</field><field name="description">The Continuously fed Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) is a popular design for anaerobic treatment of wastewater. This reactor type is simple in design and operation, independent of biomass type and low in capital costs. The CSTR has, however, to be operated at long Hydraulic Retention Times (HRT) of the order of 16 to 30 days since biomass is continuously lost with the effluent. Various alternate concepts of reactor design have, therefore, been developed to allow more rapid treatment. Treatment can be enhanced by retaining biomass within the digester so that the HRT is decoupled from solid biomass retention time (SRT). Unlike in continuous stirred tank digesters where the SRT is equal to HRT, the SRT in other designs are much greater than the HRT. This allows the wastewater to be treated at high throughputs while retaining the biocatalyst (or biomass) mediating the treatment within the digester. 

In this study the operation of a CSTR was intensified by separating SRT from HRT while taking into account the economical aspects. The intensification of operation is defined as increasing wastewater throughput or organic loading rate while at the same time maintaining efficiency of treatment and robustness to reject disturbances (changes in wastewater concentration and flow rate). The operation of existing CSTR was intensified by addition of carriers. It is hypothesized that by providing surfaces (or carriers) for bacterial attachment within the continuous stirred tank digester, biomass will be better retained and the wastewater throughput can be increased. 
The carriers or surfaces employed in this study were light carrier elements (shredded granular rubber tire having a density of 0.96 g/cm3) that move gently with the water in the reactor. This carrier material is much cheaper compared with other commercial carrier materials. This reactor type, called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Reactor (AMBR), was applied in this study to treat high strength synthetic wastewater, containing molasses as the main substrate. 

The improvement of reactor performance was clearly shown by the capability of the system to be operated without any difficulties at HRT of 6 days at an OLR of 5.8 g COD/l/d or at HRT of 1 day at an OLR of 4 g COD/l/d. The carriers were shown to be effective in retaining biomass aggregates. 

The AMBR was further intensified by changing the feeding strategy. It was shown that in stirred tank digester without carriers an intermittent feeding strategy resulted in better microbial capacity to degrade higher chain volatile fatty acids like propionic and butyric acids than the continuous feeding mode. An increase in degrading capacity of the intermittently fed digester was shown via degradation rates of pulse additions of propionic and butyric acids and by its capability of handling all changes in loading rates imposed. The continuously fed digester, receiving constant feed, on the other hand, suffered more when loading rates were changed, and the degradation rates of propionic and butyric acids were slower.

The intermittent feeding mode was then implemented on the AMBR, and it was operated as a sequencing batch reactor with a fill, react, settle and decant period in each cycle. The sequencing batch mode when applied to the AMBR (now called an Anaerobic Moving Bed Sequencing Batch Reactor or AMBSBR) could increase capability of the digester to handle higher shock loads. At 3.8 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 10.8 g COD/l/d as opposed to 7.4 g COD/l/d by the AMBR. At 2.5 d HRT the AMBSBR could handle an OLR of 6.4 g COD/l/d while the AMBR could only be loaded at an OLR of 4.2 g COD/l/d. The ratio of SRT to HRT was at least 15 for this reactor. The reactor was able to handle concentrated feed flow rates at longer cycles or more dilute feed flow rates at frequent shorter cycles. 

The proposed operational strategies were verified by using a structured mathematical model which was developed based on the IWA ADM1 model. Several modifications were implemented to the model to obtain better predictions. The modified model was capable in predicting all the trends of the operating variables from both continuously and intermittently fed reactors. None of the two model versions (ADM1 and modified models) was, however, able to predict the increased propionate degradation capacity in intermittently fed digesters. The reason for this was the assumption of fixed stoichiometry of fermentative reactions for glucose mineralisation. By modifying the fractions of glucose mineralisation a better fit between experimental results and the model could be obtained.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sewage</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="subject">Anaerobic treatment</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051014.141638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Theory of Cooperative Learning as Incentive-Values&#150;Exchange:  Studies of the Effects of Task-Structures, Rewards and Ability on Academic and Social-Emotional Measures of Mathematics Learning</field><field name="creator">suchan@pacific.net.sg</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis is concerned with the social psychology of cooperative learning and its effects in cognitive and social-emotional domains.  It comprises two main studies and two exploratory studies undertaken during two 10-day, 16-hour learning intervention programmes for Maths Word Problem-Solving (MWPS), respectively for 285 and 451 Grade-5 students in Singapore.
Study 1 used a quasi-experimental design to investigate the outcomes of task-structures in an Individual Learning condition and three dyadic Cooperative Learning conditions that varied in the key elements: positive interdependence, individual accountability and group goals. The results indicated that a Cooperative Learning condition with a high level of positive interdependence in combination with a low level of individual accountability resulted in significantly lower MWPS academic achievement and peer&#150;self-concept outcomes than the other conditions; whereas the other Cooperative conditions with lower levels of positive interdependence did not differ significantly from the Individual Learning condition in MWPS academic outcomes but produced better peer&#150;self-concept outcomes. The discussion theorises how task-structured positive interdependence in cooperative conditions can potentially be so rigid that it limits individual control in overcoming a dyadic partner&#146;s error. In turn, this increases the likelihood that members of dyads would &#147;sink together&#148; (rather than &#147;swim together&#148;) &#150;which appears to produce relatively worse MWPS academic outcomes as well as being detrimental to peer&#150;self-concept outcomes. Therefore, optimal cooperative learning conditions for mathematics should allow interaction amongst student partners but not preclude individual control over any stage of the learning task.
Study 2 comprised three interrelated investigations of the effects of rewarding learning behaviours and the effects of ability-structures on Individual, Equals (homogeneous) and Mixed (heterogeneous) dyads. All children were eligible to be rewarded for their own MWPS academic mastery achievements, but comparison groups in each of the ability-structures were either eligible or not eligible to be rewarded for displaying target learning behaviours (LB-Rewards or No-LB-Rewards). The academic programme was based on Polya&#146;s problem-solving strategies of understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and checking the results. Children in all learning conditions were instructed to use these problem-solving strategies and, according to their differently assigned learning conditions, to use learning behaviours (LB&#146;s) either &#145;for helping oneself&#146; in Individual conditions or &#145;helping one&#146;s partner&#146; in Equals and Mixed conditions. In &#147;LB-Rewards&#148; conditions, teachers rewarded the children&#146;s displays of the assigned behaviours for learning alone or learning together, whereas in &#147;LB-No-Rewards&#148; conditions they did not.
The investigation in Study 2a encompassed the same dependent variables as Study 1. The results indicated that for maths (MWPS), Learning Behaviour rewards were detrimental to Individual Learning conditions with significantly lower MWPS gains when the rewards were used compared to when they were not, whereas the opposite pattern was found for Equals where the effects of Learning Behaviour significantly enhanced MWPS outcomes. For peer&#150;self-concept, effects varied across the Cooperative conditions&#146; Learning Behaviour rewards conditions. An exploratory analysis of High-, Low- and Medium-ability revealed patterns of the inter-relationships between ability-structures and effects of rewarding. 
Study 2b is exploratory and involved traversing the traditional theoretical dichotomy of individual vs social learning, to develop a measure combining them both in &#145;self-efficacy for learning maths together and learning maths alone&#146;. The effects of the various experimental conditions on factors in this measure were explored, allowing detailed insight into the complex, multi-dimensional and dynamic inter-relationships amongst all the variables. The findings have been developed into a theory of Incentive-values&#150;Exchange in Individual- and Cooperative-learning, arguing that there are four main cooperative learning dimensions &#150; &#147;individual cognitive endeavour&#148;, &#147;companionate positive influence&#148;, &#147;individualistic attitudes development&#148; and &#147;social-emotional endeavour&#148;. The argument is that students&#146; motivation to learn cooperatively is the product of perceived equalization of reward-outcomes in relation to each dyadic member&#146;s contributions to learning-goals on these dimensions. Hence, motivation varies across ability-structures and reward-structures in a complex manner. A further proposition of the theory is that social-emotional tendencies and biases form a dynamic system that tends to maintain dyadic partners&#146; achievement levels relative to their ability-positioning. 
Study 2c is exploratory and extends Study 2b by illustrating its Incentive-values&#150;Exchange theory. Samples of children&#146;s written descriptive reflections of their experiences in cooperative dyads are provided to illustrate the point made about the children&#146;s relationships and effects on each other for each of the factors on the individual- and cooperative-learning scales. As such, this section of the thesis offers a parsimonious explanation of cooperative learning and the effects of various learning conditions on the integrated cognitive, social and emotional domains.
Practical implications in light of the study&#146;s findings of optimal conditions include the possibility of practitioners more closely tailoring cooperative learning conditions to meet the academic or social-emotional needs of learners at specific ability levels. Future directions for research include testing some of the learning dimensions and proposed theoretical configurations for them using controls identified by the statistical analyses together with qualitative observations, and further developing new methodologies for investigating the social-psychological causes and consequences of learning motivation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">cooperative learning</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051019.151329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sandpit Dilemmas: Challenges of researching young children</field><field name="creator">g.mackenzie@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In the past twenty years there has been a movement against the tradition of positivist, scientific research that treats children as the &#145;object&#146; of research.  This movement has been led by the sociology of childhood literature but also has supporters in disciplines such as developmental psychology and early childhood studies.   Research within this new paradigm often seeks to gain the perspectives and lived experiences of children, giving them a voice through naturalistic methodologies such as ethnography and informal interviews.   However, giving children a &#145;voice&#146; has not been purely an academic endeavour.  Supported by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) which stipulates that States should assure that children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them, there is a push at all levels of government for children to be given a chance to express their views on issues that concern them.  In Australia and overseas, the consulting of children on issues that concern them has become more commonplace.  Thus in both research and policy development, methodologies which enable adults to get closer to the world of the child and to hear their views are being explored.

This thesis explores some of the issues involved in this form of qualitative research with children. It does so through combining theoretical exposition and systematic reflection with the author&#146;s own empirical research which sought to gain an understanding of young children&#146;s views of &#145;difference&#146; through an ethnographic methodology.

Part One provides the theoretical base for the thesis, by exploring how &#145;the child&#146; and childhood have been conceptualised within western thought. Drawing on the sociology of childhood, it also probes a number of the implications of this tradition and examines  how it has shaped research on children both in terms of the methods that have been employed and the topics that have been of interest.

Both chapters in Part Two focus on the empirical component of the study.  The first is an extended methodology chapter which explores not only the method employed and the research setting but also some of the challenges that the author faced in the field and a discussion of issues such as ethics and the status of the researcher.   Using logs of the children&#146;s activities and the author&#146;s field journal, the next chapter explores how the initial research question altered and the issues that came to the fore during the research.

Part Three reconsiders a number of the theoretical issues raised in Part One in light of the fieldwork discussed in Part Two. It asks how certain ethnographic studies, claiming affiliation with the sociology of childhood, nevertheless ended up with depictions of children not far from the positivistic studies their authors had critiqued.  It argues that this can be explained by the persistence of a &#145;problem centred&#146; adultcentric frame which privileges understanding of a particular issue (e.g. the development of racism in children) over the actual experiences of individual children. Given the renewed interest in consulting children this proposition has practical as well as theoretical significance as it reveals how easy it is for slippage to occur and the importance of preventing it.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qualitative research with children</field><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">sociology of childhood</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051027.81709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifecycle, biology and diversity of Puccinia boroniae in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">susannad@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">The rust fungi (Uredinales, Basidiomycota) are an expansive and diverse group of fungal species, consisting of approximately 7000 different species in over 160 different genera.  Fungi of the genus Puccinia represent a large proportion of these rust fungi, many species of which are well known for their role in causing massive yield and subsequent economic losses in agricultural crops worldwide.  Puccinia boroniae is one such rust fungus and is a significant pathogen of several species of Boronia (Rutaceae), a native Australian wildflower grown commercially in Western Australia as a cutflower.  Complete control of the rust pathogen is rarely achieved using chemical fungicides.  Improving the level of disease control is vital for the long-term sustainability and future growth of the Boronia industry, and requires an understanding of the pathogen.  The objectives of this thesis were to investigate aspects of the epidemiology, the biology and the diversity of P. boroniae in Western Australia, providing a broad understanding of the pathogen, which in turn could be employed to improve disease control.

The lifecycle of P. boroniae was conclusively shown to be microcyclic by artificial inoculation of Boronia heterophylla with basidiospores released from germinating teliospores suspended over the host plant.  Telia developed on the leaves within 21 days, with no intermediate rust spore stages (pycnial, uredial or aecial) observed.  Rarely, low numbers of pycnia of P. boroniae were observed on field specimens collected from leaves of B. megastigma cultivated at one commercial floriculture plantation.  This was the first record of pycnia of P. boroniae; however, as pycnia were not observed on other host species or plantations, or formed during controlled inoculation trials, their functional role in the lifecycle is currently unresolved.  

Telia were subepidermal, erumpent and pulvinate, amphigenous on leaves, stems and parts of developing flower buds, and generally persistent year round.  Intracellular hyphae resembling monokaryotic haustoria (M-haustoria) were observed in leaf mesophyll cells beneath and adjacent of telia.  Occasionally Sphaerellopsis filum (teleomorph Eudarluca caricis), a known mycoparasite of rust fungi, was observed on the telia.  Under favourable conditions, teliospores germinated immediately without a period of dormancy, with fully mature basidiospores formed within 3&#150;4 h after telia were exposed to moisture.  Basidial development in P. boroniae was unusual, in that only one basidiospore was formed from each germinating teliospore cell.  Immature teliospores were initially binucleate undergoing karyogamy to form a single large (presumably diploid) nucleus that migrated into the developing metabasidium.  Both binucleate and tetranucleate metabasidia were observed, with mature uninucleate, binucleate and tetranucleate basidiospores present.  At this stage, more research is required to understand the complete nuclear behaviour during teliospore germination.  The morphology of the pycnial stage was similar to other Puccinia species, being ampulliform, subepidermal, amphigenous and arranged in small clusters on leaves of B. megastigma.  However, the spine-like periphyses protruded through stomata as apposed to penetrating the leaf epidermis.  

Environmental conditions favouring the formation and dispersal of basidiospores were assessed in vitro and under field conditions with a spore catcher.  Under field conditions, basidiospores were captured from February&#150;August 2004, with peak numbers and daily incidence occurring during autumn (April/May) when the average temperature range was 9.1&#150;22.6 &#176;C.  Daily basidiospore numbers were positively correlated with minimum daily temperature and total daily rainfall.  A distinct diurnal periodicity of release was observed, with numbers peaking on average between 02:00 and 05:00 hrs.  The hourly release of basidiospores was positively correlated with relative humidity and negatively correlated with temperature and evaporation.  This data was in agreement with the in vitro experimentation, which showed that basidiospore formation occurred between 10&#150;25 &#177; 1 &#176;C (apparent optimal temperature of 15&#150;20 &#177; 1 &#176;C) with telia incubated in continuous darkness promoting a greater number of basidiospores.  

The level of genetic variation of P. boroniae in Western Australia was assessed by PCR-RFLP of the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer 2 (IGS2) region.  Two RFLP profiles were observed, separating three specimens (Group 1) from the remaining population (Group 2).  Sequence analysis indicated that point mutations at endonuclease recognition sites were responsible for the changes in RFLP profile.  Group 2 specimens had been collected from the same host species (B. megastigma) and plantation, and it is suggested that the variant specimens may constitute a subspecies of P. boroniae, isolated by geographic location and possibly host (cultivar) specificity.  Further analysis, primarily pathogenicity trials, is needed to confirm this.

This study has improved our knowledge regarding the rust fungus P. boroniae and has laid strong foundations for future research into several aspects of the biology, epidemiology and population variation.  The implications of the key findings of this research, with an emphasis on the management of P. boroniae in commercial situations, are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obligate biotroph</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051101.181603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Indigenous Housing System &#150; A Systems Social Assessment</field><field name="creator">Andrea@jardineorr.net</field><field name="description">Indigenous Australians make up a mere 2.4% of the population of whom
around a quarter live in remote and very remote parts of Australia. The poor
state of Indigenous housing in remote areas is generally acknowledged as
one of Australia&#146;s most intractable housing problems. The thesis examines
why the remote Indigenous housing system does not meet the housing
needs of Indigenous people in remote areas and discusses an alternative
system.

The aim of the thesis is to understand why the remote Indigenous housing
system is not meeting people&#146;s needs, despite policy statements that
emphasise empowerment and partnerships. This understanding of the
current remote Indigenous housing system involved placing it in historical,
policy and international contexts and examining the current attempts to
rationalise and streamline the system.

The service-delivery concepts of supply-driven (externally prescribed) and
demand-responsive (community determined) are applied to remote
Indigenous housing. The characteristics of successful remote Indigenous
housing, namely Indigenous control and self-determination, an enabling
environment and a culturally responsive system, are developed and found to
be characteristic of a demand-responsive system. The research
hypothesises that the remote Indigenous housing system&#146;s supply-driven
focus is largely responsible for the housing needs of Indigenous people in
remote areas not being met.

This was tested using the new methodology of a Systems Social
Assessment which is developed by combining Social Assessment and
Checkland&#146;s Soft Systems Methodology.

This methodology illustrated that the current remote Indigenous housing
system has a supply-driven focus where the housing &#145;solutions&#146; are
controlled and largely provided from an external source, in this case the
Commonwealth and State governments and their agents. The thesis
discusses an alternative demand-responsive focus where remote
communities have more control over the nature and delivery of their housing
that may prove more successful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote indigenous housing</field><field name="subject">systems social assessment</field><field name="subject">social impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051103.134917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation Biology of Bottlenose Dolphins(Tursiops Sp.) in Perth Metropolitan Waters</field><field name="creator">hugh.finn@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">This thesis examines two potential conservation problems for a residential sub-population of ~75 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Cockburn Sound, a small embayment within the southern metropolitan waters of Perth, Western Australia: (1) human-induced habitat change and (2) illegal feeding (i.e. unregulated provisioning) of dolphins. The work is important because Cockburn Sound is the most intensively utilised marine environment in Western Australia and industrial, commercial, and recreational uses of the area will intensify in coming decades. These considerations, coupled with the demographic and ecological vulnerability of residential
populations of small cetaceans, suggested a risk of population decline without a more informed scientific basis for management. This study (2000 &#150; 2003) complemented an earlier study of the Cockburn Sound dolphins (1993 &#150; 1997) to provide a decade-long longitudinal study of the population. The original contributions of this study relate to: (a) the foraging ecology of dolphins;(b) the effects and mechanisms of human-dolphin interaction, particularly interactions based on unregulated provisioning; and (c) an integration of previous research and other information.

Studies of the foraging ecology of dolphins within Cockburn Sound were undertaken between 2000-2 to determine the areas used by dolphins and their feeding behaviours so that the implications of human-induced habitat change could be assessed. These studies used belt transect
sampling and event-specific sampling of foraging aggregations of dolphins to quantify the foraging habitat use of dolphins within the Sound and to characterise spatial and temporal patterns in aggregations of foraging dolphins. The results showed that the density of foraging
dolphins varied significantly across habitats and that foraging aggregations consistently occur in an area known as the Kwinana Shelf during the austral autumn-spring period. The studies also suggested that the foraging ecology of dolphins in Cockburn Sound reflects the consistent utilisation of both: (a) low-density prey species (i.e. individual or weakly-schooling prey) and (b)
high-density prey species (i.e. schooling species such as forage fish). These findings indicate that
ecosystem-based conservations of the population should consider the conservation requirements of dolphin prey species and the ecological integrity of key foraging habitats like the Kwinana Shelf.

Human-dolphin interactions based on the illegal feeding of dolphins in Cockburn Sound escalated between 1993 and 2003. By 2003, a total of 14 individuals exhibited behaviours indicative of conditioning to human interaction by food reinforcement, including some individuals that
engaged in provisioning interactions on a chronic (i.e. long-term) basis. Observations of the effects of unregulated provisioning indicated that: (a) provisioned dolphins sustained increased higher rates of human-induced injury than non-provisioned dolphins and (b) provisioning was associated with substantial and enduring behavioural changes including changes in ranging and association patterns. Other observations of human-induced injury in Cockburn Sound included seven instances of calf entanglement. These findings indicate that the effects of illegal feeding and other forms of direct human-dolphin interaction (e.g. entanglement) could achieve biological
significance for the population.

The possible contribution of (a) human influences, (b) social learning, and (c) behavioural
propensities (e.g. age and sex) on the acquisition of an attraction response to human provisioning was examined through logistic regression analysis using age, sex, use of high-boat density areas, and the number of close associates that were previously provisioned as predictor variables and the acquisition of an attraction response as the dependent variable. This analysis was supplemented
by behavioural observations of interactions between provisioned and na&#239;ve individuals during provisioning interactions. The results supported three findings: (1) a relatively high level of exposure to human provisioners was a significant predictor for the acquisition of an attraction response by dolphins; (2) social learning contributed to the acquisition of an attraction response in
those individuals that more frequently utilised high-boat density areas; and (3) the potential contribution of behavioural propensities relating to age and sex was uncertain. These conclusions suggest that the acquisition of an attraction response to human provisioning can best be
understood as the outcome of a complex of interacting factors. 

The findings also indicate: (a) the management value of individual-specific and longitudinal data for the management of harmful human-wildlife interactions and (b) the potential for social learning to contribute to the development and persistence of these interactions.
The findings of this study indicate that population decline in Cockburn Sound could be induced by: (1) a reduction in the Sound&#146;s environmental carrying capacity or (2) mortality, injury, and behavioural changes resulting from interactions with humans. The potential for such a decline and evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of human activities on dolphins supports the
application of preventative approach to the management of illegal feeding and entanglement and a precautionary approach to environmental impact assessments of proposed developments. Mitigation of direct human-dolphins like illegal feeding requires an enforcement and education program to encourage more responsible human attitudes towards interactions with dolphins.
Research on the ecology and composition of finfish assemblages and the trophic structure of the Kwinana shelf would assist efforts to mitigate the impact of human-induced habitat change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bottlenose dolphin</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051103.135358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Driving cycles, urban form and transport energy</field><field name="creator">J.Kenworthy@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The oil shortages and price rises of the 1970s led to a broad spectrum of policies designed to save fuel in transport. One such group of policies concentrated on utilising the longstanding observation that congestion-free driving improves vehicular fuel economy. In particular, improving the average speed of urban traffic was believed to reduce urban fuel use. Strategies to create free-flowing traffic networks through traffic engineering and management techniques became an integral part of most transport energy conservation strategies. At the same time urban systems studies were appearing which suggested that urban land use factors are fundamental in determining transport energy demand. Some cities with denser, more centralised developnent patterns and congested traffic systems appeared to have lower per capita transport energy use than cities with low density, dispersed land use and free-flowing traffic networks. Conflicts thus began to be recognised between these land use studies and the traffic studies but they were never systematically examined. 

This thesis focuses on explaining and attempting to resolve these apparent conflicts by drawing out the relative importance of freeflowing, fuel efficient traffic and broader land use/transport factors in determining urban system fuel efficiency. It does this by showing how a holistic understanding of transport energy use can be achieved by recognising the different levels of know1edge involved and by integrating research a t all these levels. Adopting this approach, a detailed examination is made of transport energy use in Perth, Western Australia. Spatial and temporal patterns of urban driving and vehicular fuel consumption are derived using a computer-instrumented vehicle within a framework of urban ecology. These patterns are described in detail and are found to be understandable in terms of a simple model of intersection and vehicle-based traffic events. Using this simple model, urban driving and fuel consumption patterns are then systematically linked back to their urban ecological framework. Centrality, as expressed by urban activity intensity emerges as the major underlying factor in both the urban ecological framework and driving patterns. Driving cycles for central to outer areas as well as the whole city are produced and a detailed examination is made of driving cycle development procedures, including the issue of data resolution. Two new methods of driving cycle synthesis are formulated. 

Driving cycles together with travel survey and land use/transport model data are then used to estimate spatial differences in transport energy use per capita within the urban ecological framework. This case study is used to test two conceptual models of transport energy conservation implied by the traffic and land use studies: a linear assumptions model which suggests reductions in urban system fuel use through freer-flowing traffic and a feedback assumptions model which introduces some possible broader system effects of free-flowing and congested traffic. The results suggest very strong support for the feedback model and a reversal of the linear model. Urban structural factors such as distance from the CBD and density are found to be the major explanatory factors of Perth's transport energy use. The much higher vehicular fuel consumption in Perth's inner areas due to restricted traffic flows are completely offset by energy conserving land use and transport features which result in lower per capita energy use in these areas; the lower vehicular fuel consumption in uncongested outer areas is swamped by land use factors which result in longer travel distances and less use of energy conserving modes, resulting in markedly higher per capita energy use, i .e. a trade-off is found between a fuel efficient traffic system and a fuel efficient urban system. It is concluded that policies which propose fuel savings from "blanket" improvements in urban trraffic flow, such as major road building programmes will be counter-productive, while urban planning policies which encourage higher density, more compact cities will tend to lower energy use. It is suggested that a key area of research is now how to combine selective traffic system improvements with urban land use policies so that both may work in concert to produce a more fuel efficient urban system.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Driving cycles</field><field name="subject">Energy</field><field name="subject">Transport</field><field name="subject">Urban form</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051103.145933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catching the ball: constructing the reciprocity of embodiment from hardcopy</field><field name="creator">dr_mccardell@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary dissertation is a study of the ways in which we sensually embody and experience ow world. It is a metaphilosophical account that begins within orporeality; indeed, it is suggested that this isthe place where the philosophic urge is argued, elaborated, and reflected upon.

While many studies of embodiment tend to focus upon "the body" as object, cultural artefact, or text for cultural inscription, the approach used in this dissertation is with the incarnation (the making flesh) of interaction in particular socio-physical milieux. The shift is thus from investigation of bodies to bodying, from noun form to transitive verb of incorporealization. This shift is felt necessary in order to better understand the so-called dualisms of traditional Western philosophic thought: mindbody, self-other, self-world, nature-culture, etc., and Tantric inspired Eastern philosophies of self-all relationality. It will be suggested, taking
the lead from Leder (1990), that these apparent dualisms are not so much "add-ons" to philosophies of being, but arise in the experiential body itself.

This dissertation endeavours to rethink certain "givens" of everyday life, such as perception of time and space, place, enacted memory, having empathic feelings for others, and so on, from within bodily experience and occidental-oriental philosophies of being. Certain neurological disorders are examined for their way of deconstructing elements required to construct a meaningful incarnated life-world. 

The process of embodiment is not only what the body is, but what it does.

My construction of what is necessary for embodiment studies therefore considers bodily praxes (cultural and individual), as well as the sensual, sensate experiences arising in the body.

The image of a ball game is evoked in various ways throughout the dissertation not only because it well describes the dense layers of interaction and an emergent sense of bodiliness, but it also illustrates reciprocity and situatedness.

This thesis is intended to contribute to the health sciences as well as cultural studies. It draws upon the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, J. J. Gibson's ecological psychology, neurological studies and case histories, and the Eastern tradition of Tantrism in its Mahayanist Buddhist and Taoist forms.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Embodiment</field><field name="subject">Interaction</field><field name="subject">Mind-body philosophy</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of medicine</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Ethnomethodology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051108.155958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spurning yearning and learning Aboriginality: ambivalence shaping the lives of non-aboriginal Australians</field><field name="creator">D.Palmer@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Much academic work concerned with social and cultural processes in Australia takes as its field of inquiry how the lives of Aboriginal Australians have been changed and impacted on by colonisation. Rarely has scholarship attempted to uncover some of the ways Aboriginality and Aboriginal people have become integral in the shaping of the lives of non-Aboriginal Australians.

Ths thesis takes to heart the challenge of subjecting oneself and one's own social and cultural position to the rigours of sociological scrutiny and sets out to examine how crucial Aboriginality and Aboriginal people have been in shaping the lives, identities and economies of non-Aboriginal Australians.

Drawing on the work of Homi Bhabha the thesis argues that ambivalence, whch underlies much of colonial discourse, can have a tremendously disruptive and unsettling effect on the authority, identities and everyday social lives of non-Aboriginal people. The thesis explores something of the diversity of this ambivalence by focusing attention on five groups of people (One Nation Supporters, retired tourists, 'alternative lifestylers', governmental workers and early colonists); two historical moments(early colonial times and the late 1990s); and two regions (the south-west and Kimberley of Western Australia).

The thesis argues that one of the effects of ths ambivalence is that the social worlds of non- Aboriginal Australians are often subjected to challenge and change. In early colonial times many 'settlers' were tom between the will to colonise and economic and cultural reliance on the efforts and knowledge of Aboriginal people. More recently, One Nation supporters attempt to distance themselves from Aboriginal people by constituting them as the barbaric and parasitical other. At the same time, Hansonites indirectly position Aboriginality as central to their own identity and political future. Another group, retired tourists, regularly perpetuate old colonial tropes and publicly express their disdain of Aboriginal people. At the same time, these people yearn for and engage in social practices otherwise associated with Aborigrnal culture. Behind both groups' public attacks on Aborigines as cannibals and the 'Aboriginal Industry' as spongers lies a deep political and cultural reliance on Aboriginality. Romantics and others who aspire to consume and mimic Aboriginal culture are likewise regularly ambivalent and contradictory in their treatment of Aborigmality. It is arguable that many are selfinterested and seek to plunder Aboriginal cultural. However, the very romance that prompts their mimicry can and does act to unsettle the certainty of non-Aboriginal dominance. This prompts people to re-examine their identities and social practices. Ambivalence and complexity is also central to the lives of those involved in the business of Aboriginal governance. On the one hand, these people are clearly implicated in the government and regulation of Aboriginal people. On the other hand, liberal discourse on fairness and equality of opportunity force governmental workers to increase their contact and reliance on Aboriginal people. This often has the effect of provoking changes in non-Aboriginal people's personal and working lives.

The thesis concludes that the engagement of colonial discourse with Aboriginalities inevitably leads to an ambivalence that disables the monolithic dominance of non-Aboriginal Australians. In a range of ways this ambivalence can and does produce conditions whch undermine and transform the cultural lives and identities of non-Aborignal Australians.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Anthropology of Australian</field><field name="subject">Race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051108.160550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">With a whole heart : nurturing an ethic of caring for Nature in the education of australian planners</field><field name="creator">wendy@sarkissian.com.au</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary dissertation addresses one aspect of the education of Australian urban planners: an ethic of caring for Nature, conceived as a deeply grounded, contextual, ethic based on a sense of connection with the natural world. It articulates what an ethica of caring entails, explores the current state of and' potential for the teaching of environmental ethics within Australian planning schools, examines fiom an ethical standpoint the educational implications of direct connection with Nature, and proposes the foundations for a radical curriculum for planning education to nurture an ethic of caring for Nature. Three pivotal assumptions underpin this research: that Australian urban development is contributing to both local and global ecological crises; that the activities of urban planners help to determine the form and style of urban development and, by implication, the ecological impacts; and that the education of urban planners influences their practice. I argue that a complete revisioning of Australian urban planning education is necessary to counter the entrenched anthropocentrism and utilitarianism which underpin both planning practice and education.

The dissertation sets out to address three questions: What is the current situation in Australian planning schools with respect to the relationship between planning education in general and education in environmental! ethics, in particular?; HOW might the education of urban planners in Australia be changed to contribute to the solution of ecological problems?; and How important to the educator and the student who ultimately becomes the practitioner is a direct experience of Name in giving substance and energy to the formution of environmental ethics?

The study employs two primary research approaches or paths, the path of explanation and the path of expression, the first with a quantitative emphasis, and the second being primarily qualitative research; both are within the interpretive research paradigm. It addresses the educational origins of what appears to be: planners' continued unquestioning participation in Australian urban development ad their resistance to embracing more realistic formulations of a relationship with Nature. It offers the first articulation of a learning model upon which an undergraduate or postgraduate curriculum could be based.

The dissertation begins by asking, via an exploration of secondary sources in feminist epistemology and ethics, what an ethic of caring could involve. The current situation with respect to environmental ethics education in Australian schools of planning is then thoroughly examined, yielding the tentative conclusion that virtually nothing is happening, that there is little to build on. Asking what could be the potential for direct experience of Nature to nourish an ethic of caring, the next section chronicles my personal experience of a year spent consciously attempting to do this: a journey to my ecological self. The last sections of the dissertation summarise the lessons learned from all aspects of the investigation, particularly the direct experience of Nature. Following examination of problems inherent in emancipatory and technocratic liberal educational philosophies, I propose the elements of a radical curriculum for planning education to nurture an ethic of caring for Nature. In the learning model which emerges, the T.EN.C.E.L. model, I argue for a curriculum which contains components of the following elements: teamwork;
direct experience of Nature; grounding in community processes and experiences; the formal study of ethics, by means of environmental ethics courses; and attention to the aspects of professional literacy necessary to understand environmental issues related to planning practice.

The dissertation also includes, as an appendix, a videotape, "Beginning Again with Nature: Environmental Ethics," designed to communicate those qualities of my journey to the ecological self which are better expressed in sound and images.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051109.104544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable urban water systems : policy and professional praxis</field><field name="creator">mike.mouritz@dpi.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The provision of water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure is an essential ingredient of cities. However, questions are being raised about the type and form of urban infrastructure, for economic and environmental reasons. Traditionally these techologies have offered linear solutions, drawing increasing volumes of water into cities and discharging waste at ever increasing levels, causing escalating stress on the
environment. In addition the costs of water infrastructure provision and replacement, both in the developing and developed world, is becoming prohibitive. In response, a new paradigm has been called for and new solutions are emerging that have been labelled as Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM). This concept can be considered to consist of both technical and philosophical dimensions, and represents a new form of professional praxis. However, the adoption of these techniques and concepts is constrained by the inertia of the existing urban water systems. It is therefore argued that the introduction of any change must occur across a number of dimensions of the technoeconomic system of the city. These dimensions-artefacts and technical systems (i.e. the technology and knowledge systems), professional praxis and socio-political context (i.e. institutions, culture and politics) and biophysical realities and world views (i.e. the environment and underlying values) - provide a framework for analysis of the change process - both how it is occurring and how it needs to occur. This framework is used to illustrate the link between environment values and the process of technological innovation, and points to the need for the emerging values and innovations to be institutionalised into the professional praxis and socio-political context of society. Specifically, it is argued  that a new form of transdisciplinary professional praxis is emerging and needs to be cultivated. A broad review of the literature, an evaluation of selected emerging technologies and three case studies are used to illustrate and argue this position. These examples show the potential economic, social and environmental benefits of IUWM and provide some insight into the potential which this approach has to influence the form and structure of the city and at the same time highlighting the institutional arrangements required to manage urban water systems.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">urban water management</field><field name="subject">integration of land and water planning</field><field name="subject">water sensitive urban design</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051109.95558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jesus and the banquets : an investigation of the early Christian tradition concerning Jesus' presence at banquets with toll collectors and sinners</field><field name="creator">M.Marshall@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The topic is approached from the perspective of table fellowship, the primary focus being Jesus' commensality with toll collectors and sinners. The fundamental hypothesis is that Jesus typically arrived akletos at meals as an itinerant stranger, and that this explains the epithet "glutton and drunkard."

Part One sets the parameters, and delineates the materials, methods, and approach adopted in the study. In Part Two, ancient traditions of hospitality and feasting are examined, providing the background material for exegesis of relevant NT texts in Part Three.

It is found that toll collectors represent hosts to Jesus, while "sinners" gain entry to meals as his umbrae. Both groups are eligible for the kingdom, as are paidia (young slaves/servants), who exemplify humility. Some possible reasons are advanced for Jesus' criticism of Pharisees, but it is emphasised that they are not implicated in his death. The importance of hospitality is indicated by the fact that reception of Jesus and/or his disciples necessarily entails an invitation to a shared meal. In contrast, merely giving alms to strangers/wayfarers who seek hospitality signifies rejection. Any such breach of hospitality mores will incur harsh punishment at the final judgment.

The supposition that Jesus was a guest at the Last Supper allows for an innovative interpretation of his words and actions, particularly since it is proposed that as well as the Twelve, akletoi were present, viz. women, slaves/servants, and possibly Gentiles. It is suggested that the depiction of Jesus in the Synoptics may have been influenced by a pre-existing literary archetype that facilitated the combination of some fictional characteristics with historical elements. The proposed reconstruction of the historical Jesus demonstrates the centrality of hospitality, commensality, and humility in his teaching and practice, a finding that is consistent with the ideals and table fellowship of early Christian communities. The apparent dichotomy between hospitality and hostility indicates a need to follow Jesus' injunction to love one's enemies, i.e. to practise philoxenia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historical Jesus</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">commensality</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051110.163641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Consumption Patterns in Australian Aboriginal Communities</field><field name="creator">emmayuen@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Aboriginal Australians have a significantly lower health status than their non-Aboriginal counterparts.  To facilitate healthy living practices necessary for good health, a high level investment is currently made in water services, on the assumption that there is a relationship between the volume and quality of water supplied with health outcomes, despite the high economic and environmental cost.  This thesis investigates whether the current design supply criteria of 1000-1200    litres per person per day of water, meeting the Australian Drinking Water Quality Guidelines, is both sufficient and necessary to improve the health of Aboriginal Australians.  The scope of the thesis is limited to the sufficiency of design guidelines although it necessarily also touches on the broader issues of Aboriginal health.  

Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to explore current water consumption patterns of consumers at multiple hierarchical levels (community, household and individual) and hence the requirements of physical infrastructure on which consumers depend.  Multiple linear regression was used to consider factors correlated with supply volume, while metering was used at both the domestic and appliance level to determine where and how water was used.  Meters were installed on fixtures in two houses in a community near Alice Springs.  This was then complemented by qualitative information obtained through focus group discussions, key informant interviews and observation in the field.  The appropriateness of the supply of high quality water for all uses was addressed by considering the volume of drinking water intake and its impact on the derivation of water quality guidelines.  This was achieved by a face-to-face survey involving 57 volunteers.  Fieldwork was conducted predominantly in three communities near Alice Springs although some additional data was collected in other communities in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 

The results showed that the factors influencing water consumption were highly complex and variable between communities and individuals.  However, there were some culturally specific needs identified in Aboriginal communities, such as the need for temperature and dust control, as well as the reduction of losses.  The unique characteristics of each community made it difficult to provide a more precise estimate for design supply.  As a result, overly conservative guidelines such as those already used are necessary in the short term despite there being no guarantee of improved health.  In the long term, issues of community governance and capacity building will start to be addressed, and the realisation that social systems are both complex and dynamic will need to be reflected in policy.  These issues were represented in a systemic conceptual model at the end of the thesis, which also highlighted inadequacies of reductionist approaches such as design supply guidelines.  The thesis concluded that complex problem situations such as that of health, require a systems approach.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">intake</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">supply</field><field name="subject">multiple linear regression</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051119.134422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Western Australian Education Policy and Neo-classic Economic Influences</field><field name="creator">Iain.Browning@det.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is primarily an historical examination of how neo-classic economics influenced WA education policy formation from the mid 1980s until the release of the Curriculum Framework (1998). It first aims to examine and explain the context and origins of neo-classic economic influences globally, and then explores the process and impact of its introduction to WA policy-making in general, and to education policy in particular.

Within the thesis some fundamental propositions put forward by other theorists are built upon. The most significant is the view that between 1983 and 1998, there has been a distinct and well documented shift in the primary ideological forces driving education policy throughout the western world. This is attributable to a strengthened link between education and national economic goals which has resulted in an economic imperative and the use of an economic discourse to describe educational aims. From these understandings this thesis explores whether neo-classic economics has played a significant influence in shaping education policy in WA, as it has done in many parts of the world.

The methodological approach principally involves the textual analysis of major policy documents preceding and including the Curriculum Framework (1998). The focus is on primary and secondary sources, essentially to discover, analyze, and demonstrate how neo-classic economics had influenced education policy in WA by 1998.

Taking a pragmatic approach, this professional doctorate makes a specific contribution to research through synthesizing the impact of neo-classic economics on WA schools policy via a range of principally secondary sources. In particular, it explores how neo-classic economics influenced WA education policy by seeking to answer four fundamental research questions:

1. Was the influence of neo-classic economics evident internationally, and if so did it impact on education policy?

2. How did neo-classic economics influence Australian Commonwealth Government schools policy?

3. Were there clear neo-classic economic influences evident within other Australian states, and, if so, did they influence schools policy?

4. In whose interests were neo-classic economic education policies?

Neo-classic economic approaches were espoused widely as a solution to the apparent failure of in economics from the early 1970s onwards. Beare (1995) argued that in many countries policy perspectives for education and other welfare services changed in a number of 'profound' ways, the most significant was the use of an economic rationale to justify almost every significant policy initiative.


Within the Anglo-democracies, specifically the US and UK, the pursuit of neo-classic economic policies involved the adoption of initiatives allowing the 'market' to dictate what should or should not occur within the economy. As a part of the neo-classic economic drive, governments endeavoured to improve efficiency within the public services. Consequently, education policy became driven by an economic imperative often to the detriment of educational aims.

This study demonstrates that neo-classic economic policy came to dominate government decision making in Australia following the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983 (Dudley and Vidovich 1995).This was similar to neo-classic economic patterns in the US and UK. By 1985 neo-classic economic trends at the Commonwealth level were clearly evident and become overt and robust with the passage of time. Under Minister Dawkins Commonwealth education policy was fumy linked to national economic goals.


An examination of the Victorian context demonstrates neo-classic economic trends within the other Australian states' education policies. Under the Kennett Liberal Government the shift to neo-classic economic education policy resulted in reductions in educational spending, staffing cuts and school closures. The prime motivation for the reforms was the reduction of costs and the aligning of education through a focus on vocational subjects and employment related skills.


Concomitant with the rise of neo-classic economics was a commensurate growth in the attention of Australian business and industry to education policy. Business and industry groups increasingly promoted the notion of human capital theory by linking education and economic growth. This can be partly attributed to employers' growing interest in having schools produce individuals suitably prepared for positions in the workplace, a phenomenon which has been reflected in WA secondary schools through a shift to a vocationalised curriculum (Browning 1977). In effect business was able to defray expending capital on training workers through hiring school leavers tailored for workplace positions. From at least the early 1980s there was accelerating evidence of a more active and open involvement of business in the major education inquiries which also contributed to policy formation dominated by neo-classic economics.


The exploration of the global and national context of neo-classic economics confirms that neo-classis economic influences within WA Qd not occur in isolation. From at least 1987 it is evident that neo-classic economics influenced WA education policy. The consequence was a curriculum shaped predominantly by economic interests as opposed to educational concerns.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History of Western Australian Education</field><field name="subject">Neo-classic Economic</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Education Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051129.112230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spiritual development and the public educative care of children: a critical evaluation of biblical and dynamic systems perspectives</field><field name="creator">Glenn.Cupit@unisa.edu.au</field><field name="description">A useful model of spiritual development in the public educative care of children must: specify the meaning and nature of spirituality; clarify its relationship to an underlying ontology; identify in what sense spirituality is developmental; be consistent with a justifiable paradigm of human development; explain the role and status of such spiritual development with a secular system of educative care; and specify practical implications flowing from these matters.

Using narrative criticism within an evangelical framework, the biblical descriptions of spirituality and childhood were critically examined as a basis for such a model. Biblical spirituality was developmental and was identified with encounters, usually naturally mediated, between human spirits and God's Spirit, and spirits which alienate from God's Spirit. All children, without qualification of belief, community, rite or age, were identified as spirits who share a special relationship with God's Spirit both ontologically and experientially. Biblical childhood was not defined chronologically but functionally by inability to take responsibility for one's own spiritual life because of openness to God's and other spirits.

Principles of 'magician systems' in Dynamic Systems Theory parallel phenomena of human development and those commonly designated as spiritual. Consequently, a dynamic model of spiritual development is proposed which is consonant with biblical teaching and grounded in an established scientific paradigm. This indicates that spirituality is an inescapable aspect of any educative care setting or system and need not be introduced as though children lack it. Spiritually salient aspects of educative care will lead children to spiritual encounters which are derivative of a positive life affirming principle or fundamentally destructive and alienating. These aspects encompass the spiritual ontology of the setting, the children, the personnel, the physical environment, the nature and quality of relationships, the curriculum, religious activities, the nurture provided, and the wider context, all of which are of spiritual moment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spiritual development</field><field name="subject">children's spirituality</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">child care</field><field name="subject">Theology of children</field><field name="subject">Dynamic systems</field><field name="subject">Spiritual educa</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051129.114720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and Geography: Literacy Pedagogy and Curriculum Politics</field><field name="creator">Alison.Lee@uts.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into processes of gendered subject production in literate practices in school settings. Focusing on student writing in geography, the study explores gender differences in written texts with a view to asking what is differently at stake for girls and for boys in 'becoming literate' in school geography.

The study is an ethnographic case study of a geography classroom, focusing in particular on contexts for the production of two texts which are subject to close textual analysis. Drawing on a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives: curriculum studies, linguistics and feminist theory, the thesis argue that classrooms are sites of multiple and competing discourses. Student texts are oriented discursively and generically in different ways. These orientations both reflect and produce wider discursive alignments within the discipline of geography and elsewhere. The thesis investigates the politics of these differences.

Part I builds a detailed account of the Year 11 geography classroom as a set of curriculum contexts within which students' literate practices are located. Readings are produced of the official curriculum resources, focusing in particular on the syllabus and the classroom textbook material. The spoken language dynamics of the classroom are investigated in terms of the materiality of processes of speaker positioning along gender lines in the production and negotiation of geographical meanings.

Part II produces detailed readings of two student essays: one by a girl, one by a boy. Differences between the two are investigated, drawing links between the texts and the discursive contexts of their production and reception. The argument is made that the two texts enact a significant gender difference in and through different geographies.

Part III discusses the consequences of the thesis findings for contemporary debates about literacy pedagogy. This includes a critique of one dominant framework within which the notion of 'critical literacy' is being engaged: that of educational linguistics. Finally, the argument is made that existing accounts of 'subject-specific literacy' need to be expanded to engage two senses of the word 'subject': both the specificity and multiplicity of the discourses of subject-disciplines and the concomitant production of different human subject positions through textual practice. To investigate the implications of this, theories of literacy pedagogy, it is argued, need to engage more substantially with available theories of the subject, such as feminist theories, while at the same time engaging sophisticated analytics for the exposure of the material workings of discursive practices in school-literate productions.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051129.144620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Performance Indicators on the Work of University Academics: A Study of Four Australian Universities</field><field name="creator">J.Taylor@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In 1988, the Australian Federal Government released the document Higher Education: A Policy Statement which was intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the higher education sector. This paved the way for the application of performance indicators (Pls) across higher education, most notably the creation of a link between Pls (called the Composite Index) and the research component of the annual government funding to universities. Although PIS for teaching became popular, funding for the teaching component was not directly attached to PIS and remained largely based on student enrolments.

The purpose of this study is to examine the perceptions of university academics in Australia on the effects of research and teaching as a result of the introduction of funding based on research Pls. The academic literature suggests that Pls can bring about desirable effects but it also warns that their imposition, particularly by the government on universities, may lead to unintended and undesirable effects, such as goal displacement and strategic manipulation, which may be designed to enhance apparent research performance. To guide the investigation, it was hypothesised that the government's Pls which focus on research will be integrated into the universities' internal policies; will encourage universities to place a high priority on the research activities funded by the Pls; will lead to significantly more paperwork; will contribute to a significant change in the approach to research but not to teaching; and will result in academics adopting negative attitudes towards Pls.

Two basic sources of information were obtained to evaluate these hypotheses. First, the administrations of selected universities were consulted, and staff interviewed, to gauge the degree of change that had been implemented by the universities. Second, a questionnaire was constructed in order to assess academics' attitude towards Pls, and their perceptions of an association between Pls and their institutional reward system. The questionnaire also assessed changes in research, teaching and paperwork activities.

The universities selected characterised the different kinds of universities found in the Unified National System of the Australian higher education system. One hundred and fifty-two academics from these universities were surveyed by the questionnaire. Thirty percent of these academics participated in a structured interview. The disciplines from which the academics were selected for participation included arts/humanities, science, and professional studies which included a natural science based profession and a social science based profession. In addition, a case study of one of these universities was carried out.

The institutions were found to have reorganised their internal policies to incorporate and focus on the Pls in the government's Composite Index. The academics surveyed were generally found to have negative attitude towards their institutional Pls, although staff of higher rank had relatively more positive views. Reasons for their dissatisfaction included the inability of Pls to capture the various dimensions of academic work and privileging research over teaching. For a majority of the academics, the introduction of Pls was associated with a rise in paperwork load and a change in the approach to research in terms of focusing on publications and external research grant applications, particularly those counted in their institutional PI-based funding schemes. The time devoted to these activities, as well as the number of publications and grants for which they were expected to apply, have significantly increased. It was found that staff did use various strategies to maximise their PI scores, such as writing shorter papers in order to increase the quantity of publications. The proportion who changed their approach to teaching was also sizeable; most of them were concerned about getting students through their courses with minimum fuss by having lower ambitions for students and pandering to their superficial needs. However, the proportion who changed their teaching was significantly less than those who changed their research. One possible reason could be the lack of special incentives to increase their emphasis on teaching.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance indicators</field><field name="subject">Performance measurement</field><field name="subject">Performance funding</field><field name="subject">Rewards</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">University academics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051129.154225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The providence of God : a trinitarian perspective</field><field name="creator">haybel@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">The primary focus of this dissertation is the doctrine of the Providence of God and it is approached from a distinctive perspective &#150; that of the doctrine of the Trinity.Its fundamental thesis is that the adoption of a trinitarian perspective on Providence provides us with a conceptual paradigm in which varying theological emphases, which often divide understandings of Providence, are best understood in a form of paradoxical tension or creative balance with each being correctly understood only in the context that the other provides.

To demonstrate this, it addresses four issues of Providence that have on occasion divided understandings of Providence in the past and which have become significant issues of contention in the contemporary debate on
Providence occasioned by a proposal known as Open Theism. These issues concern the nature of divine transcendence, sovereignty, immutability and impassibility and how each should be understood in the context of divine Providence. Through a detailed examination of three recent trinitarian theologies, which have emanated from the three main communities of the Christian church, it argues that a trinitarian perspective is able to provide significant illumination and explication of these identified issues of Providence and of the tensions that are often intrinsic to this doctrine.

In relation to these identified issues of Providence, it affirms tensional truths in our understanding of the issues of Providence and an articulation that necessarily incorporates a binary form of language &#150; that is, utilising language of both-and rather than either-or. In other words, it posits that divine transcendence ought to be held in paradoxical tension with divine immanence; divine sovereignty ought to be held in paradoxical tension with human responsibility; and divine immutability and impassibility ought not to be understood as immobility or impassivity but as affirming the paradoxical tension of active constancy. The articulation of these tensional truths is followed and completed by an examination of how they might be applied pastorally in the specific area of prayer and its relationship to Providence.

Consequently, this dissertation not only constructively impacts our understanding of divine Providence but also significantly advances the contemporary debate on Providence concerning Open Theism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">Trinitarian</field><field name="subject">Providence Theism</field><field name="subject">Providence</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051129.162926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with curriculum change : how teachers perceive recent curriculum changes and the strategies they employ to cope with such change</field><field name="creator">cresdee@cresdee.net</field><field name="description">The current study attempted to identify conditions that affect the manner in which Western Australian primary school teachers perceive recent curriculum changes; the types of support they access; and the relative usefulness of this support. Based on preliminary findings in the first phase of this study and the research literature it was expected that teacher self-efficacy, teacher characteristics such as age and years of teaching, and school context such as the level of 'innovativeness' would prove to be influential in the process of implementing new initiatives. A model expressing the relationships between these concepts was developed and evaluated in the second phase of this study. This study is important for two reasons. It focused on Western Australian primary school teachers, whereas most previous research focused on high school teachers, and it explored ways to help teachers deal with future changes instead of simply identifying their responses to changes. It is therefore hoped that the education system will be more informed and better able to provide appropriate support for teachers when faced with future reforms.

The study was conducted in two parts. The purpose of phase one was to become familiar with the current circumstances of teachers in relation to curriculum change. By focusing on the attitudes and behaviours of teachers from 'innovative' schools it was thought more could be learned than in schools that maintain the status quo. Qualitative methods of semi-structured interviews, informal observations and the analysis of websites and school documents were utilised throughout this phase. The second phase of the study employed a quantitative approach, based on the findings of the first phase, specifically a process of questionnaire construction and distribution throughout the defined population.

A number of cautious conclusions have been made within the limits of this study. Firstly, the most useful type of professional development for teachers involves teachers interacting with each other. Teachers need time to discuss issues and share their successes. However, Action Research as a means of professional development is currently under utilised. It was discovered that most teachers were positive towards curriculum change, yet an overwhelming workload has proved a formidable barrier to new initiatives. In addition, most teachers will modify initiatives to meet the needs of their students and to fit in with their existing orientations. Consequently, school structures need to become more flexible to encourage teachers to engage in innovative practices. Interestingly, the self-efficacy of a teacher influences the way they perceive and cope with curriculum change, however teacher characteristics, such as age and the number of years teaching, did not yield substantially different results when teachers were categorised along these dimensions. School context, as defined by the level of 'innovativeness', did produce differential results in terms of teacher attitudes and responses to curriculum change, and the type of professional development accessed. Finally, schools may need to involve parents and the wider school community in the school level decision-making processes if they truly are to become ' learning communities'.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">Teachers</field><field name="subject">Western Australian primary school</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Professional Development</field><field name="subject">Reforms</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051209.134727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of four tuskfish species (Choerodon: Labridae) in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">d.fairclough@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The biology of four species of Choerodon (Labridae), the blue tuskfish C. cyanodus, the bluespotted tuskfish C. cauteroma, the baldchin groper C. rubescens and the blackspot tuskfish C. schoenleinii was studied in Shark Bay in Western Australia. These species are fished commercially and/or recreationally in this large subtropical marine embayment, which is a world heritage area. The biology of C. rubescens was also studied in the Abrolhos Islands, which are located ~ 300 km to the south of Shark Bay, where this labrid is an important commercial and recreational fish species. The broad aims of this project were to determine the following for the above four Choerodon species in Shark Bay. (1) Whether they are protogynous hermaphrodites, as is the case with many labrids. (2) The biological variables required for developing management plans for these species, such as the timing of spawning, the lengths and ages at both maturity and sex change, size and age compositions and growth parameters, and (3) the habitat types occupied during their life cycles and also of the purple tuskfish Choerodon cephalotes. Finally, comparisons are made between the age and size compositions, growth and reproductive biology of C. rubescens in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands. Where relevant, the underlying hypotheses for the individual studies conducted during this PhD are included in the following chapters.

A macroscopic and histological examination of the gonads of the full size range of C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma, C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii, together with an analysis of the length and age compositions of female, transitional (individuals changing sex) and male individuals, demonstrated that each of these species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals change sex from female to male during their life cycle. The gonads of all small (&lt; ca 100 mm) and young (&lt; ca 1 year old) individuals of each species comprised solely ovarian tissue and thus the individuals of each species began life as a female. All individuals subsequently become sexually mature as females and then later in life some will change to males. Since this was found to be the only method of sex change in these species, they are termed monandric. Individuals that were changing sex contained &#147;undelimited type 2&#148; gonads sensu Sadovy and Shapiro (1987). These gonads contained both ovarian and testicular tissue that was intermixed and not separated by connective tissue. The males of each species possessed secondary testes, which retained structures of the ovary they had replaced, such as a membrane-lined ovarian lumen, lamellae and ovary wall. Furthermore, histological sections indicated that sperm were transported towards the outer walls of the testes, where the multiple sperm sinuses present in that region were presumably responsible for transporting sperm to the cloaca, rather than to a singular sperm duct as is the case with gonochoristic species.

The typically large size and different colour of the males of C. rubescens, C. schoenleinii and C. cauteroma and the bias in the sex ratios of their adults towards females suggests that the males of each of these species are either haremic, i.e. permanently territorial, or form leks, i.e. are temporarily territorial during their spawning seasons. In these three species, the presence of ripe testes that are far smaller than ripe ovaries and the release by females of eggs in batches are consistent with a single male spawning with an individual female, as commonly occurs in haremic/lekking species. In contrast to the above species, C. cyanodus was not sexually dichromatic, the sex ratio was not biased towards either sex and the weight of ripe testes remained relatively constant as body weight increased. The latter implies that the relative investment of energy by males into testicular development during the spawning season declines with increasing fish size. Thus, the males of C. cyanodus may be opportunistic spawners when small, possibly spawning in groups, and may tend towards a haremic or lek mode of life when larger.

The respective lengths and ages at which 50% of the females of C. cyanodus C. cauteroma and C. schoenleinii attained sexual maturity (L50m, A50m) in Shark Bay were ca 129, 196 and 253 mm and 2.3, 2.0 and 3.5 years of age. The corresponding L50m and A50m for C. rubescens in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands were ca 274 and 279 mm, respectively, and 2.7 and 4.1 years of age, respectively. The respective lengths and ages at which 50% of the females of C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma and C. schoenleinii changed to males (L50c, A50c) in Shark Bay were 221, 310 and 556 mm and 4.1, 6.4 and 10.4 years of age. The length at which C. rubescens changed sex (L50c) was significantly greater in Shark Bay (545 mm) than in the Abrolhos Islands (479 mm), whereas the reverse pertained with respect to the age at sex change (A50c), i.e. 10.5 vs 11.9 years of age. Since some females were found in the oldest age classes of each species in Shark Bay and in the population of C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands, some of the females of each species do not apparently change sex.

The trends exhibited by the gonadosomatic indices of females and males and the stages of ovarian development in sequential months demonstrated that the spawning periods of each species varied. Thus, C. rubescens (in both Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands) and C. cauteroma spawn predominantly in spring, whereas spawning occurs in late spring/early summer in C. schoenleinii and in summer in C. cyanodus. As C. schoenleinii, C. cyanodus and C. cauteroma occur predominantly within the inner gulfs of Shark Bay, the offset in the timing of their spawning periods would be likely to reduce any potential for competition between the larvae of those three species for resources.

The trends exhibited by the mean monthly marginal increments in sectioned otoliths with differing numbers of opaque zones demonstrated that, in each species, those opaque zones were laid down annually. Thus, the numbers of opaque zones in the sectioned otoliths of individuals of each species could be used, in conjunction with the birth date and time of year when those zones are delineated, to determine their approximate ages at capture. The maximum ages recorded for the four Choerodon species in Shark Bay ranged only from 12 to 16 years. However, in that environment, the maximum lengths of C. rubescens (649 mm) and C. schoenleinii (805 mm) were far greater than those of C. cauteroma (424 mm) and C. cyanodus (382 mm). In contrast to the situation with C. rubescens in Shark Bay, this species reached a substantially older maximum age (22 years), but slightly shorter length (629 mm), and grew at a slower rate in the Abrolhos Islands, possibly reflecting the influence of greater productivity in Shark Bay and/or greater densities of this species in the Abrolhos Islands.
 
Although a few C. rubescens and C. schoenleinii reach large sizes in Shark Bay, most of the individuals of these species were less than 400 mm, their minimum legal length (MLL) for capture. This raises the possibility that these two sought after species, i.e. the seventh and ninth most abundant species in the recreational fishery in Shark Bay, are subjected to substantial fishing pressure. Sampling for C. cyanodus was considered representative of the sites that this species occupies in Shark Bay and the sampling methods would have been likely to have captured the full size range of this tuskfish. Thus, the failure to catch any C. cyanodus greater than 400 mm indicates that, in Shark Bay, this species does not grow to the far greater lengths of about 600 mm reported for this species as a maximum by Allen (1999). Furthermore, the 400 mm MLL for this species in Western Australia precludes the retention by fishers of this species in this environment. Choerodon cauteroma was caught at lengths up to 424 mm, which is greater than the maximum of 360 mm reported for this species (Allen, 1999). Although there is no MLL for C. cauteroma, recreational fishers are restricted to a bag limit of four fish per person per day, as is the case with all other tuskfish species.

Since fishers target large fish preferentially and the largest size classes of each of the species of tuskfish are dominated by males, heavy fishing pressure has the potential to remove a large proportion of the males of the Choerodon species that are fished in Shark Bay, i.e. C. rubescens, C. schoenleinii and C. cauteroma, and also of C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands. Since the ratio of females to males in catches of C. rubescens taken by the commercial fishery in the Abrolhos Islands are ca 1:1 and yet the typical adult sex ratio is heavily biased towards females (ca 14:1), that fishery is removing a substantial proportion of the males from the population. Protogynous hermaphroditic species are apparently able to respond to such pressure on the males by initiating a change in sex by the larger females. However, there is evidence from studies of other protogynous species that heavy size-selective fishing can lead to a reduction in the size and age at which a species changes sex and ultimately to a collapse in the stock.

The results of visual surveys, when taken in conjunction with the locations of the catches of each of the five Choerodon species, demonstrated that C. rubescens lives on reefs in &#147;oceanic&#148; waters along the western boundary of Shark Bay, whereas C. schoenleinii, C. cyanodus, C. cauteroma and C. cephalotes are found predominantly in the two inner gulfs of this large embayment. Choerodon cephalotes lives almost exclusively in seagrass beds, while C. schoenleinii and C. cyanodus occupy predominantly inner gulf reefs and rocky shorelines and C. cauteroma occurs in all of those three habitats. Choerodon cauteroma was the only species that underwent an obvious size-related shift during its life cycle, moving from seagrass to hard substrates, such as inner gulf reefs and rocky shorelines, as it reached adulthood.

The biological and habitat data produced during this thesis will provide fisheries and environmental managers with the types of information that will enable them to develop management plans for conserving tuskfish species and their habitats in Shark Bay. The biological data for C. rubescens in the Abrolhos Islands will be able likewise to be used to develop plans for conserving the stock of this species in waters in which it is heavily fished.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labridae</field><field name="subject">Choerodon</field><field name="subject">tuskfish</field><field name="subject">reproductive biology</field><field name="subject">protogynous hermaphroditism</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">age</field><field name="subject">habitats</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051212.150701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of glyceryl trinitrate and ovariectomy on femoro-tibial articular cartilage, synovium and subchondral bone in normal and osteoarthritic ewes</field><field name="creator">mcake@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Nitric oxide (NO) alters chondrocyte metabolism, and is thought to be a key catabolic mediator in osteoarthritis. NO is also an important modifier of bone metabolism, and may partially mediate the bone-sparing effects of oestrogen. Oestrogen has also been linked to the modulation of osteoarthritis, though its role is not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the structural and metabolic effects of ovariectomy and the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on (1) normal ovine femoro-tibial joint tissues, and (2) the progression of joint lesions in the established ovine meniscectomy model of osteoarthritis. 

Preliminary investigations tested a novel computer-assisted histomorphometric method of assessing osteochondral changes post-meniscectomy, in a trial of a putative disease-modifying osteoarthritis compound. Quantitative assessment revealed a subtle protective effect not evident by qualitative methods. These techniques were then used to test the experimental hypotheses in a combined trial involving 48 aged ewes, variously subjected to ovariectomy, bilateral lateral meniscectomy, and/or topical GTN therapy. At six months, joint tissues were analysed using histology, histomorphometry, dynamic biomechanical testing, serum markers, bone densitometry, and tissue culture of synovial fibroblasts and explants of cartilage and bone. Ovariectomy modified cartilage structure and chondrocyte metabolism, and induced subchondral bone remodelling. Prior ovariectomy altered the development of OA lesions post-meniscectomy, producing thicker but biomechanically inferior cartilage and elevated metabolic activity in subchondral bone. GTN treatment of normal sheep induced thinner, structurally-altered cartilage in normal sheep, and accentuated cartilage and subchondral bone lesions post-meniscectomy. These results support an important homeostatic role for oestrogen in joint tissues, and show that GTN, a commonly used angina therapy, can induce structural alterations in joint tissues and potentially accelerate the progression of concurrent OA. Results also advance understanding of the role of synovial and subchondral bone changes in the pathogenesis of this OA model.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">nitrates</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051213.150605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cold hearts versus bleeding hearts: Disciplinary differences in university students' sociopolitical orientations</field><field name="creator">B.Hastie@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The supposed liberalising effects of higher education have been documented since Newcomb&#146;s landmark Bennington study in the 1930s. However, other research has suggested that the effect of education on beliefs and values may differ between academic disciplines. The main mechanisms by which differing beliefs are believed to develop include the self-selection hypothesis (where students chose disciplines which match their pre-existing belief systems) and the socialisation hypothesis (where students are socialised into the worldview of the discipline through continued exposure). Three correlational design questionnaire studies were conducted. Study 1 and 2 featured 223 and 531 students, respectively, and Study 3 included 143 recent graduates of Murdoch University, from different academic disciplines (primarily commerce, psychology and the social sciences). Study 4 involved interviews with nine students who had switched between the three main fields of study. The quantitative results generally supported the self-selection hypothesis, although some participant accounts suggested possible accentuation effects (where pre-existing values were strengthened by university study). Future research should consider a longitudinal study, tracking students in different academic disciplines over the full-length of their degree. A cross-sectional community study would also be valuable, in determining whether large scale difference exist between the those with tertiary, compared to those with lower levels of education, and whether discipline differences persist following graduation (and whether this is linked to occupation). These findings have important implications for the way universities view themselves, in terms of shaping the minds of the next generation of leaders, and for disciplines, in terms of the types of students they attract and how they can best retain them. In conclusion, there are significant differences in the belief systems of students in different academic disciplines, although not as large as may be expected, and that this seems primarily due to self-selection, rather than socialisation or accentuation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political ideology</field><field name="subject">political socialisation</field><field name="subject">university students</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051214.170628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagined geographies: women's negotiation of space in contemporary Australian cinema, 1988-98</field><field name="creator">Catherine.Simpson@scmp.mq.edu.au</field><field name="description">Imagined Geographies: Women's Negotiation of Space in Contemporary Australian Cinema is an exploration of the nexus between gender and locale in films from the last decade, 1988-98. This thesis examines the way meaning is made through the negotiation of diverse geographies by central female protagonists in a selection of recent Australian feature films. The films I analyse were
predominantly produced by female writers and/or directors.

In the context of Australian Cinema, locale is an area much talked about but little theorised. It is an issue which remains in the background of much scholarship and is often tangential to many arguments but rarely constructed as a central concern. Where it is foregrounded, as in Ross Gibson's work, it is reduced to the significance of landscape or 'natural locations' rather than examining the diversity of its manifestations.

Two notable but related spatial shifts have occurred in Australian cinema of the 1990s. The first is a change in industrial practice. Female artists are now creating spaces for themselves in mainstream feature filmmaking - spaces traditionally occupied by men. This trend is away from constructions of a distinctly feminist cinema or counter-cinema which was identifiable in the 1970s. Second, there is a shift in the character of on-screen space. The presence of growing numbers of women writers, directors and producers in the Australian film industry is shifting the cinema's focus away from traditional 'masculine' topographies - the pub, the prison and the outback - thus allowing explorations of other spaces and visions to develop. I am arguing therefore that there is a feminization ofspace occurring in Australian cinema.

In this thesis I investigate representations of so-called traditional 'feminine' or domestic domains. The place of the gendered body and embodiment in films is a central concern and is theorised in the first chapter. As we move through the thesis chapters, sexed bodies enacting gender in a variety of ways and in different zones - the car, the house, the suburb and the country town - will be explored. Through these analyses I examine the methods some film directors employ to problematize space in such a way that their work overcomes the limitations of its previously dominant representations. This thesis is primarily an attempt to open up the field of criticism to acknowledge the diversity of locales which exist within the rich tapestry of Australian Cinema.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary Australian cinema</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051214.95411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergenerational tension in the workplace : a multi-disciplinary and factor analytic approach to the development of an instrument to measure generational differences in organisations</field><field name="creator">easther@telstra.com</field><field name="description">An ageing population is changing the nature of the workplace, one outcome of which is an increase in the proportion of older workers. Unlike older workers of some twenty or so years ago, today's older workers plan to stay at work longer than at first anticipated. However, as many older workers have found, their intended and continued presence in the workplace is not always appreciated. As such, they are subject to subtle and not so subtle forms of discrimination associated with ageist practices, or ageism, and negative perceptions regarding their ability to compete on equal terms with younger workers. In turn, it is suggested that older workers, too, indulge in ageist practices and the stereotyping of younger workers. It is proposed that underlying generational differences,when combined with ageism, negative stereotyping and discriminatory organisational practices, are responsible for a new phenomenon called intergenerational tension in the workplace.

The notion of tension, which can be thought of as suppressed anxiety or a strained relationship between individuals and groups, is important because intergenerational tension is presented as a latent or covert phenomenon. From this comes the following definition: "lntergenerational tension in the workplace is a latent or covert form of intergroup conflict caused by value and attitudinal differences between the generations." lntergenerational tension can be thought of as an everyday fact of organisational life which exists as an undercurrent or type of background organisational noise that is so pervasive that it is rarely noticed. In this respect, intergenerational tension bears similarities to gender and ethnic tensions both of which have been recognised as counterproductive to organisational efficiency.

This thesis proposes a construct to measure this intergenerational tension. To investigate the generational differences associated with this new construct, a 25-item questionnaire was developed. The first stage in the development of the questionnaire was an informal experience survey that was completed by a small sample (n=54) of adults ranging in age from 21 years to 70+ years. A pilot study questionnaire was then constructed and administered to a small, stratified random sample of employees (n=60) from the Western Australia Police Service (WAPS). WAPS has recently changed from a seniority-based promotion system to a merit-based system for most positions and is undergoing a major cultural change in response to social and political pressure. Following data analysis, the final questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire, called the Intergenerational Tension Questionnaire (ITQ) was administered to a stratified random sample of employees from WAPS. Five hundred completed responses were subject to factor analysis in which principal components analysis extracted seven factors or dimensions thought to underlie intergenerational tension. Further data analysis revealed that on average, younger workers (i.e., less than 40 years of age) displayed less intergenerational tension than did older workers (i.e., more than 40 years of age). Data for workers a generation apart (i.e., 20 years apart) were also analysed, with the younger generation being those less than 30 years of age (the Under 30s) and the older generation being those more than 50 years of age (the Over 50s). The younger generation, on average, displayed less intergenerational tension than did the older generation.

Of the measures, organisational change was associated with the greatest degree of intergenerational tension for all groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the best predictors of intergenerational tension for younger workers and older workers were age, the length of service with one's current employer, and the number of years in the paid work force. For workers a generation apart, multiple regression analysis revealed that age was the only predictor. It was fortuitous that at the time of the study, the majority of younger workers were Generation X and the majority of older workers were Baby Boomers. This meant that to all intents and purposes, the questionnaire measured differences between two well-studied generational cohorts.

The findings supported the notion that organisations should not assume they are treating all workers equitably. In particular, older workers feel disenfranchised and angry at their treatment by organisations which, in their opinion, favours younger workers. The implication for organisations is that both groups should be treated independently, with each having its own special needs and expectations. This includes, for example, implementing strategies such as training methods suited to the needs of each age group and conducting age diversity training to raise awareness of what it means to be either a younger worker or an older worker.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intergenerational tension</field><field name="subject">workplace conflict</field><field name="subject">younger workers</field><field name="subject">older workers</field><field name="subject">ageism</field><field name="subject">generational differences</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051216.144720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular epidemiology, clonality and virulence of Dichelobacter nodosus, the agent of ovine footrot</field><field name="creator">Nbuller@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Dichelobacter nodosus, an anaerobic bacterium, is the major transmissible agent of ovine footrot. The disease expresses as a virulent or benign lesion in the hoof. Virulence is related to the production of serine proteases, particularly a thermostable protease. Isolates of D. nodosus are characterised according to the type of protease produced (either heat-stable or heat-labile) and the electrophoretogram (zymogram) of the protease. This study reports on the use of the DNA-based typing techniques Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Infrequent-Restriction-Site-PCR (IRS-PCR) to investigate the molecular epidemiology of D. nodosus, including a consideration of the relationship between genetic type, zymogram patterns and whole cell protein profiles. 
The aim of the project was to obtain a better understanding of D. nodosus strain diversity and dissemination in Australia and its relationship to virulence within the population. The overall intention was to use this information to assist in the long-term control of virulent footrot. 
Field isolates of D. nodosus from Western Australia (n = 735), New South Wales (n = 16), Victoria (n = 24) and South Australia (n = 21) were obtained and analysed. Both typing techniques that were used offered good differentiation between isolates for epidemiological purposes, and the results were in general agreement. PFGE provided slightly better discrimination between isolates, with 214 PFGE types (181 from Western Australia) compared to 94 IrsT types (77 from Western Australia). Within this diverse range of molecular types clonality was observed - with clones being defined as clusters of isolates having closely related PFGE types. The strains were categorised as genetically diverse, genetically similar or identified as the same strain. This diversity of genetic types was found overall, within flocks of sheep on a farm and within a single hoof where, on a number of occasions, multiple molecular types and zymogram types were found colonising a single hoof. One isolate that was experimentally inoculated into a flock of sheep produced six different genetic types when tested 12 months after the initial infection. This indicates that D. nodosus undergoes rapid genetic change, which means that follow-up epidemiological investigation of disease outbreaks and trace-backs need to be done as soon after infection as possible. The genetic differences appeared to be due to large insertions or deletions of DNA. 
Amongst sheep on some properties, isolates that had a different protease expression and virulence expression were found to have the same molecular type. Investigation of these isolates by SDS-PAGE showed that they also had the same whole cell protein profiles. Isolates from the same clonal groups also had the same protein profile, whereas genetically diverse isolates had different protein profiles. The lack of protein differences between isolates of the same molecular type, or within a clonal group, suggests that the differences in protease thermostability may be due to conformational changes in the protein, rather than to overall detectable genetic change and/or expression of different proteins. These results demonstrate that PFGE typing can be useful in predicting likely phenotypic expression of whole cell proteins. Further work is required to elucidate differences between virulent and benign strains of D. nodosus.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">footrot</field><field name="subject">dichelobacter nodosus</field><field name="subject">molecular epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051222.103243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into aspects of the replication of Jembrana disease virus</field><field name="creator">M.Stewart@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is an acutely pathogenic lentivirus affecting Bali cattle in
Indonesia. The inability to propagate the virus in vitro has made it difficult to quantitate
JDV and determine the kinetics of virus replication during the acute disease process.
Reported for the first time are 2 techniques that enable quantification of the virus, and
the use of these techniques to quantify the virus load in plasma of cattle during the
acute disease process. The 2 techniques were a qualitative one-step JDV real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for the detection
and quantification of JDV RNA, and a JDV p26 capture ELISA for the detection and
quantification of JDV capsid protein. The limit of detection of the qRT-PCR was 9.8 x
102 JDV viral RNA copies over 35 cycles, equivalent to 4.2 x 104 JDV genome
copies/ml, and a peak virus load of 1.6 x 1012 JDV genome copies /ml during the acute
febrile period. Viral RNA and JDV p26 levels were correlated in 48 plasma samples
obtained from experimentally infected cattle. A significant positive correlation (R =
0.835 and r2 = 0.697) was observed between the 2 techniques within the range of their
detection limits, providing a solid basis for the use of the economical capture ELISA to
quantify JDV load when real-time PCR capability is not available. The detection of
JDV p26 by capture ELISA was, however, much less sensitive than the real-time RTPCR
with a detection limit equating to approximately 1 x 108 JDV genome copies/ml.
The transcriptional pattern of JDV during the acute phase of infection was studied by
RT-PCR, sequencing and northern blot analysis. Analysis revealed a complex pattern
of transcription with the identification of 14 transcripts, which confirmed 6 predicted
splice sites and the identified 7 splice sites not reported previously. A small 78 bp
putative non-coding exon was identified that shared the same splice acceptor as vif
and was associated with the alternative transcripts of tat, rev and env. Four tat, 3 rev
and 2 env transcripts were identified. The rev and env transcripts were demonstrated
to use the same splice site. The study confirmed that the production of a tmx
transcript, a unique gene identified in the two bovine lentiviruses JDV and Bovine
immunodeficiency virus (BIV). Northern blot analysis identified 11 of the 14 transcripts
identified by RT-PCR, including a 7.8 kb gag/pol primary transcript and singly spliced
transcripts. The complexity of the transcript map produced suggested that JDV
replication is a highly regulated process.

One of the aims of this thesis was to determine the functional role of the Tmx and Vif
accessory proteins of the bovine lentiviruses. Although this aim was not achieved,
molecular reagents were produced that will allow these investigations to proceed. The
Vif and Tmx proteins of both JDV and BIV were successfully expressed as C-terminal
fusions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) using the pGEX-6P-1 bacterial
expression system. The recombinant proteins were purified and were recognised by
both BIV and JDV antisera from Bos taurus and Bos javanicus respectively, and by
antibody in sera from cattle that had been vaccinated with a tissue-derived JDV
vaccine and also those that had been naturally infected with JDV. The Vif, Tmx and
Rev proteins of JDV and vif BIV were successfully expressed in a Rev-independent
manner in COS7 and bovine macrophage cells using a pcDNA3.1&#174; mammalian
expression system. Cellular localisation of the recombinant viral proteins varied in the
2 cell types: in COS7 cells, both JDV and BIV Vif were detected predominantly in the
nucleus, whereas in bovine macrophage cells BIV Vif localised in the cytoplasm and
JDV Vif localised in the cytoplasm and nuclear membrane. JDV Tmx localised in the
cytoplasm of COS7 cells but the nuclear membrane of bovine macrophage cells, and
BIV Tmx localised in the nucleus and nuclear membrane in both cell types and
appeared to affect the morphology of the nucleus. Mutations of vif and tmx were also
successfully engineered into an infectious clone of BIV and these mutated clones will
provide a valuable resource for further investigation of the role of Vif and Tmx in
replication of the bovine lentiviruses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jembrana disease virus</field><field name="subject">replication</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051222.104106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chelas, Ansars and Acolytes:Becoming a teacher in, and for, a remote and culturally diverse community</field><field name="creator">Aprice@cidhs.cx</field><field name="description">This study examines the way in which three Education Assistants (EAs) engaged with
an Initial Teacher Education (ITE) program at an Australian Higher Education
Institution (HEI). In order to assist the EAs to engage with the ITE program the
school in which they worked developed a series of intervention strategies. These
strategies combined to form what became known as the Christmas Island District
High School (CIDHS) Trainee Teacher Program. Through this program the EAs were
provided support in the various critical aspects of the ITE program.
Within an Australian context the EAs were from non-mainstream backgrounds. They
were mature age women who had disrupted educational backgrounds, spoke English
as a second language, and were living in a geographically remote location. Their
journey from &#145;Education Assistant&#146; to &#145;Teacher&#146;, via an ITE program and with the
support of the school, is the subject of this inquiry.
A grounded qualitative research methodology is used to investigate and analyse the
participation of the EAs from their points of view. The personal and grounded
experiences of the participants in this study are then supplemented by a review of the
international literature pertaining to non-mainstream participation in Higher
Education.
Specifically, the study examines significant aspects of an ITE program including:
&#149; Entrance via alternative access programs
&#149; Engagement with course theory and school practicums
&#149; Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL)
&#149; The implications of studying via distance mode
&#149; The role of mentors
&#149; The impact of funding structures and fees on non-mainstream students
As well as the pragmatic aspects of the program, this study also examines the critical
impact that various Discourses (Gee, 1999), and the ideologies that underpin them,
had on the ability of the participants to successfully make the transition from
Education Assistant to Teacher.
The dissertation ends with a series of recommendations for action for the HEI sector,
schools sectors and regulatory authorities. The aims are to add to the international
literature on non-mainstream participation in ITE and to aid in the development of
ITE programs that better address the needs of non-mainstream students.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">mentoring</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051222.113244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing-Between:Australian and Canadian Ficto-criticism</field><field name="creator">hflavell@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The current cultural climate, theoretical developments, the changing state of the tertiary institution, and the increasing presence of voices from the margin have contributed to the critical re-evaluation of academic writing as a way of knowing and representing the world. At the same time, hybrid forms of writing, those that exist in the interstices of established generic codes, are experiencing increased critical attention. Yet, despite the fact that genre has become an inadequate notion to describe boundary-crossing writing, little appears to have shifted in the way these forms are understood. Dominant methodologies tend to render what is between less visible or valid, and they define this space only in terms of its relation to set borders. Located at the boundaries of what is familiar and unfamiliar, &#147;writing-between&#148; is a contentious space where elements are combined without clear rules to aid identification. In this thesis the term &#147;ficto-criticism&#148; is used broadly to describe generically transgressive writing that blurs the defining lines between creative and critical texts. The thesis explores the political and theoretical implications of writing-between through a discussion of Australian and Canadian work in English (or English translation), which display the characteristics of the ficto-critical form. This thesis argues for a critical understanding of ficto-criticism that conceptualises it as a highly political strategy of literary intervention, rather than as a mere trend toward cross-genre writing. Indeed, rather than understanding it as surface play, the thesis argues that ficto-critical practice is deeply troubled by the oppressive role of academic writing and that, significantly, its emergence was highly influenced by postcolonial and feminist theory. Thus, ficto-critical practice interrogates the violence of representation and explores what is left out and or misrepresented through that process. The thesis applies Deleuze and Guattari&#146;s concept-tools to articulate a methodology by virtue of which desire and ficto-criticism are understood as productive forms that are liberated from an equation of lack. The tension between ficto-criticism as an open practice and the tradition of scholarly writing, which requires a clear fixed proposition and outcomes, mirrors the project of ficto-criticism, which seeks to unlearn one&#146;s authority and privilege as the beginning of a process towards developing an ethical relationship with the other.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ficto-criticism</field><field name="subject">fictocriticism</field><field name="subject">deleuze</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20051222.114143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transpersonal literature</field><field name="creator">19310449@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">What do you get if you apply Ken Wilber&#146;s theories of transpersonal psychological development within human consciousness to William Golding&#146;s Lord of the Flies or Conrad&#146;s Heart of Darkness, or Shakespeare&#146;s Hamlet?  Can they provide a clear interpretative tool in order to uncover the intentional or unintentional aspects of consciousness development contained within them?  Do these literary texts reveal a coherent quest for knowledge of human consciousness, the nature of good and evil, and the ineffable question of spirit?  Is there a case for presenting a transpersonal perspective of literature in order to expound the theories of this psychological discipline?  Can literary texts provide materials that are unique to that art form and can be explicated by knowledge of transpersonal psychology?  Is there an evolutionary motion, which is not necessarily historically chronological but nonetheless displays a developmental map of human consciousness across literary works?  In other words, can we see a hierarchical framework along the lines of consciousness development as proposed by Ken Wilber, that suggests a movement up the evolutionary ladder of consciousness from Lord of the Flies to Hamlet and beyond?  Can we counter oppose Lord of the Flies and Hamlet, suggesting that the first is a fable of regression to transpersonal evil within a cultural community and the second sees Hamlet attempt to avoid this path in order to move toward the transcendence of ego and self, within the individual?  If this is so then we should be able to plot both paths relative to the models of development traced in Wilber&#146;s theories and interpret the texts according to this framework.  What is the relationship between transpersonal aspects of consciousness and literature?  And what are the effects upon the cultural consciousness of human evolution that literature has had so much to inform?  How do the literary works of individuals inform the cultural consciousness and transcend the age in which they are written? Equally we should be able to test the theories with the aid of some texts of literature &#150; especially those works which are of, and about consciousness.  What does this mean to the literary interpretation of these texts?  How does it differ from other interpretations?  What are the pitfalls and what disclaimers need to be put in place?

Recently, transplanted oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) crops have been reported to be sensitive to zinc (Zn) deficiency. However, Zn nutrition in transplanted field crops has not been investigated in detail. The objectives of this present research were to investigate whether transplanting increases external Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape, and the mechanisms of root function, growth and Zn uptake after transplanting including rhizosphere modification capacity by plant roots. The second objective was to examine the relative effects of root pruning and transplanting on Zn responses of oilseed rape, and the third objective was to determine external and internal Zn requirements of transplanted oilseed rape for diagnosing and predicting Zn deficiency. 

An experiment on a low Zn sand  (DTPA extractable Zn 0.14 mg kg-1) was set up to determine whether transplanted oilseed rape had a higher Zn requirement than that of direct-sown plants. Low Zn supply depressed shoot dry weight, however, root growth was relatively more strongly suppressed than shoots. Maximum root dry weight required much higher external Zn for transplanted plants compared to direct-sown plants, whilst shoot dry weight required a similarly low external Zn supply. In addition, transplanted plants were sensitive to zinc deficiency during the early post-transplanting growth, and the response weakened as the plants recovered from root injury or transplanting stress. However, the transplanted plants also experienced root pruning before transplanting and so in this experiment the higher Zn requirement could have been due to root pruning or transplanting or both. 

A further experiment was undertaken to determine the comparative external Zn requirements of direct-sown and transplanted plants in well-stirred chelate-buffered solution culture where a rhizosphere effect on plant availability of Zn forms is absent and the effects of  poor root-soil contact on post-transplanting growth are minimized.  In solution culture at the same level of Zn supplied, direct- sown plants produced higher shoot and root dry matter and greater root length than those of transplanted plants.  However, since a higher external Zn requirement was found for transplanted plants in buffered solution culture than for direct- sown plants, it was concluded that the higher Zn requirement was not related to decreased rhizosphere modification, to greater demand for Zn or to poor root-solution contact, but rather to the time required for transplanted plants to recover from transplanting and root injury. The recovery of root function in solution culture was more rapid than that in soil culture and expressed as a higher Zn requirement for shoot as well as root growth. It suggested that the delay in root recovery in soil culture was due to slower absorption of Zn from the soil after transplanting than was the case in solution culture. 

Chelate-buffered nutrient solution culture and harvesting plants successively at 5 day intervals until 25 days after transplanting was used to examine the mechanisms of the recovery of root growth and function. In this experiment, the external Zn requirement of transplanted plants was investigated with unpruned or pruned root systems. Plants with unpruned root system and sufficient Zn supply exhibited faster recovery from transplanting than those with pruned root system plants. The results suggest that root pruning impaired Zn uptake by plant roots and slowed down the root and shoot growth after transplanting. Increased solution Zn partly alleviated the effects of root pruning and presumably this is a major reason why transplanted oilseed rape had a high external Zn requirement. However, root pruning also appeared to impair water uptake, and may have suppressed shoot growth through sequestering carbon for new root growth and through decreased phytohormone production by roots. 

Since rapid root recovery of transplanted plants is essential for successful of growth in the field, Zn application to the nursery bed was explored as a starter   fertilizer to stimulate root growth after transplanting. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether increasing the seedbed Zn would stimulate new root growth of transplanted oilseed rape, and therefore would alleviate the need for increased external Zn for post-transplanting growth. Results showed that adequate Zn concentration in the seedbed promoted the post-transplanting growth by stimulating the new root growth especially increased root length, and also hastened the recovery of root systems. However, high Zn concentration at transplanting still had a more dominant effect in stimulating the new root growth of oilseed rape after transplanting. 

The final experiment was set up using rhizobags with three rates of Zn supply and unpruned or pruned root systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the chemical change in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere or bulk soil and its relationship to the recovery of root function after transplanting, and also to identify and quantify the organic acids in soil extracts of direct-sown and transplanted plants. The rhizosphere soil pH was lower than that of non-rhizosphere soil, and the decrease of soil pH was suggested as the mechanism of the increase of Zn availability and mobility in the rhizosphere soil. Direct-sown plants were more efficient in utilizing Zn than those of transplanted plants especially compared to those of plants with pruned root system. Zinc deficient plants excreted higher concentration of organic acids particularly citric acid, suggesting this was a mechanism of Zn mobilization and Zn uptake by roots of oilseed rape. 

The main implications of the present study for the management of Zn nutrition of transplanted crops were: the need to increase the Zn application to crops in the nursery and at transplanting compared to direct-sown plants; the possibility that external requirements of other nutrients will be greater in transplanted crops also requires further consideration; and in cropping systems where transplanting is practised, greater attention should be given to the avoidance of root damage during the transplanting.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc in agriculture</field><field name="subject">Effect of zinc</field><field name="subject">Soil</field><field name="subject">Plant transplanting</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060109.135933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher identity in uinversity classrooms: Reflexivity and professional learning.</field><field name="creator">J.Pearce@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Many academics become teachers without the help of formal professional learning.  This study explores how a small group of academics have done this.  The research aims to uncover the informal, experiential means whereby participants have constructed the knowledge about teaching and learning that underpins their pedagogies.  The research begins with the assumption that three key elements play a major role in supporting academics&#146; informal learning about teaching.  These are a person&#146;s previous experiences of learning, their experience of being part of a particular academic environment and their personal or &#145;private&#146; theories about teaching and learning, which are experientially based.

Life narratives were collected from a small group of university teachers who participated in qualitative interviews and provided written evidence of their experiences, practices and philosophies of teaching.  The research uses an ethnographic, interpretive approach to collect and analyse data in which participants&#146; voices are foregrounded.  The researcher&#146;s life narratives also form part of the final thesis, demonstrating an &#145;engaged&#146; approach to research and providing explicit evidence of the researcher&#146;s positioning in relation to the subject matter of the thesis. 

The research reveals the importance for participants of a &#145;teaching self&#146; or consistent identity that develops in early life and continues through to the adult professional context.  This identity forms a basis for participants&#146; teaching practices.  The challenges experienced by participants when institutional practices do not support or help maintain this identity are discussed, as are the processes whereby participants seek out like-minded colleagues with whom to engage in &#145;professional conversations&#146; about teaching.  The research reveals strong connections between participants&#146; sense of &#145;self&#146; and the principles underpinning their pedagogies, and the thesis concludes with some suggestions about how the concept of the &#145;teaching self&#146; might be used to support all teachers engaged in professional learning.  Finally, the research advocates &#145;reflexivity&#146; on the part of teachers, whereby a critical awareness of biography helps locate practice in the cultural and social environment in which it develops.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">university teaching</field><field name="subject">academic work</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060111.123544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the Critical Capacities of Democracy Through the Work of Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas: The Occlusion of Public Space and the Rise of Homo Spectaculorum</field><field name="creator">tauel76@netscape.net</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the condition of critical debate in contemporary liberal democracies that is based upon a combined reading of the works of Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas. It begins with an elaboration of the position that Arendt and Habermas identify a similar malaise as afflicting modern liberal democracies, which is argued to result from a shared perception that such democracies fail to create a forum for critical public engagement. The argument that their democratic theories are highly complementary is further developed through an examination of their solutions to this critical failure, for these solutions reflect a sharing of important premises concerning the nature of power and freedom on the parts of Habermas and Arendt. A complementary reading of Arendt and Habermas also allows for a synthesis of their theories that results in a highly coherent picture of the form and processes of an ideal democratic forum. This synthesis of Habermas and Arendt, however, also suggests (or, at least, allows for the theorising of) the emergence of a new genus of political actor who is unlikely to engage in such a forum &#150; a genus hereafter referred to as homo spectaculorum.

This thesis, therefore, makes three related claims. The first, and most important, is that it is possible to read Arendt and Habermas together as highly compatible democratic theorists and that their analysis of contemporary political conditions presents a single position from which to view the critical failings of liberal democracies. The second claim is that synthesising Arendt&#146;s and Habermas&#146;s democratic theories enables the theorising of an ideal public space, along with the emergence of homo spectaculorum. The third, and final, claim made in this thesis is that the same conditions that lead to the emergence of homo spectaculorum can be understood to undermine the emancipatory potential otherwise proffered through critical public spaces.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">critical theory</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">Arendt</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060125.105249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology Transfer For Sustainable Development Through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): The Bangladesh Perspectives</field><field name="creator">robi_amin@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a new instrument for technology transfer to developing countries, especially Bangladesh, in order to analyse its potential and develop policies and strategies for its successful implementation. The main research question the thesis addresses is whether the Clean Development Mechanism can assist the sustainable development of developing countries, such as Bangladesh.

Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism allows developed countries to invest in abatement opportunities in developing countries and receive credit for the resulting emissions reductions, thus becoming a tool for technology transfer. In the past, developing countries have been eager to participate in technology transfer but this has often come at a cost and not in the most beneficial way. The spirit of the CDM is to support sustainable development and encourage mutually beneficial transfer of appropriate technologies. 

The CDM is a form of market tool in which valuable goods and services are to be bought and sold. A number of technical, regulatory, project finance and administrative functions must be performed for this tool to operate. Many of these functions may be most effectively undertaken by private markets or existing international institutions. However, developing countries face problems during international technology transfer, that are still apparent under the CDM; for example: lack of proper knowledge, inadequate bargaining power, insufficient skilled persons and capable human resources, not enough adaptive capabilities, limited number of sophisticated physical facilities, fear about the effective control over national assets, uncertainty about the effects of foreign investment on the exploitation of national resources, etc. On the other hand, the CDM has the potential to fund &#147;technological leapfrogging&#148; that would enable developing countries to bypass inefficient choices, such as coal technology, made by industrialised countries. 

Poverty alleviation and development problems have been the main concern of poor countries among an obvious shortage of good will on the part of governments in industrialised countries to contribute towards these aims. New mechanisms that can stimulate investment from government as well as the private sector are needed to combat these shortcomings. Does the CDM have the potential to contribute to these broader goals? This research explores how the Clean Development Mechanism can potentially play such a role and how suitable it is within the broader picture of poverty and underdevelopment in the case of Bangladesh.

This thesis argues that the CDM, which came into force early in 2005, has the potential to become a useful tool in coping with climate change and benefit the entire global population. However, the majority of developing countries will have to balance national necessities, such as poverty eradication, food security and education, with encouraging CDM projects. The only way the CDM can contribute to sustainable development in these parts of the world (including Bangladesh) is if the mechanism embraces simultaneously social, economic and environmental responsibility and avoids becoming yet another tool to make the economically rich more richer.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060216.160551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Limits of Feminism</field><field name="creator">sw@razzed.net</field><field name="description">What is it about feminism that invites so many different opinions on what &#145;counts&#146; and what doesn&#146;t? People from vastly different cultural situations variously categorise feminist practices as extreme, radical, reactionary, unbalanced, co-opted, revolutionary, elite, exclusive, progressive, pass&#233;, and hysterical. The desire of both feminists and anti-feminists to control feminism emerges as the limiting of what feminism is, whom it is for, and where it is going. The urge to limit feminism seems, in some cases, to overtake the urge to spread the word and celebrate feminism&#146;s successes. And it is not just anti-feminists who attempt to limit feminism &#150; even feminists spend an inordinate amount of time defining certain practices out of the feminist spectrum. In this thesis, I document and analyse the way we limit feminism &#150; its participants, meaning, practices, language, history, and future. I explore the reasons why we need to contain feminism in this way, looking in particular at those who have an investment in keeping feminism comfortably small. I invite back into the realm of feminism a wide range of activities and theories we generally invalidate as feminism, including the words of several &#145;unofficial&#146; feminists I interviewed for this project. In essence, this project goes towards the rethinking of the term &#145;feminism&#146; by examining the widely differing and often contradictory definitions of &#145;what counts.&#146;</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">feminist activism</field><field name="subject">academic feminism</field><field name="subject">feminist generations</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060221.142509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voyages from the centre to the margins:an anthnography of long term ocean cruisers</field><field name="creator">g.jennings@griffith.edu.au</field><field name="description">Long term ocean cruisers are self defined as people who have accepted, adopted or chosen a cruising lifestyle, who live aboard their own sailing vessels, have independent means, are self sufficient and have been away from their port of departure for an extended period of time. As a group, cruisers, constitute a subculture (Macbeth, 1985).

Why do people choose to adopt a cruising lifestyle? Using the principles of grounded theory analysis, this study found that cruisers were motivated by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations as well as by their social background and status in society. Cruisers were motivated by a need to escape the pressures and constraints of their home society as well as to pursue a lifestyle which offered freedom and a sense of personal control, a need to add some adventure or challenge to their lives or to fulfil a dream. They were also motivated by relationship commitments and a desire to travel and experience new cultures, people and settings. Their age, gender, family life cycle stage, education, income and former lifestyle pursuits also motivated them. In setting about and maintaining the fulfilment of their motivations, cruisers exhibited personal agency in their choice to move from a life in the centre of mainstream western societies to one in the margins.

Overall, cruisers were found to be social actors who exhibit agency and self governance in decision making as to whether or not to maintain a sense of 'connectivity' with and without various social settings. Cruisers' responses to feelings of anomie and alienation in their home societies, to their feelings of under or non-actualisation at the individual level, and to their need for belonging with a partner activated these people to make choices and decisions regarding the negotiation and direction of their own social realities. Based on the cruisers who participated in this study, such agency and self governance can be described as 'empowered connectivity'. Empowered connectivity is the action of exhibiting agency in order to achieve connectivity with the space in which an individual currently finds her or himself. It can be both a holding on to and a letting go of connections. Empowered connectivity is not a 'theory' per se, but rather a generic representation of a process that accounts for 'plurality, multiplicity and difference'(Tong 1989) in the actions of both women and men as they negotiate the spaces they choose to occupy.

Moreover, this study informed by the interpretive social sciences paradigm and, a 'feminist methodology&#146; enabled an indepth understanding of cruising women's experiences to be counterpointed against cruising men's experiences. Subsequently, cruising women became subjects in their own right rather than'other&#146;. Further, the interpretive social sciences paradigm and 'feministmethodology' emphasised the need for tourism research, in particular, to use bothernic and etic perspectives in data collection and analysis.

This ethnographic study of cruisers was conducted between 1985 and 1999 on theeastern seaboard of Australia. The study involved participant observation, semi-structured indepth interviews and self-completion questionnaires relating tosociodemographics, vessel inventories, budgets and touristic experiences.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">empowered connectivity</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">long term ocean cruisers</field><field name="subject">sailing</field><field name="subject">subculture</field><field name="subject">lifestyle</field><field name="subject">alienation and anomie</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060323.161346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological aspects of Corylus avellana associated with the French black truffle fungus Tuber melanosporum and the consequence for commercial production of black truffles in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">B.Bradshaw@Timbercorp.com.au</field><field name="description">The black truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) industry in Australia is relatively new and has enormous potential but some truffi&#232;res (truffle farms) fail to meet anticipated harvest projections. Inappropriate soil conditions and climate, and the management of such factors are suggested as the primary reasons for inadequate yield. In addition, requirements for ascocarp initiation and development and the role of the host plant in such processes are unknown. This study examines interactions between European hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) black truffle symbiont in a commercial truffi&#232;re (Hazel Hill) in south-western Australia. Specific studies were initiated to examine the interactions of host physiology, mycorrhizal infection and the interaction with abiotic factors. The study related specific physiological processes of the host plant to the known life cycle of the black truffle to determine the role of the host plant in ascocarp production, if any. The work also examined the effect of silvicultural treatments intended to increase truffle production.

A review of existing literature was undertaken to determine the key soil and climatic factors required for successful truffle production. Climatic conditions appeared more important than soil chemistry and structure in Western Australia, with significant seasonal variation in air and soil temperatures required plus irrigation to supplement summer rainfall. This information was used to define areas with potential for truffle production in the south-west of Western Australia: the cooler, high rainfall regions (&gt;1000 mm annual rainfall) where there is sufficient seasonal variation in soil temperature and availability of adequate quantities of quality water for irrigation. Subsurface soil acidification and salinity, as well as groundwater salinity, are constraining factors. Lime amendment is necessary to create sufficiently high pH and CaCO3 levels required by the truffle fungus. 

A field trial was established to monitor the seasonal C dynamics of European hazel in the context of the life cycle of the black truffle. Maximum translocation of sucrose in the phloem sap coincided with the period of anticipated rapid growth of the truffle ascocarp implicating the use of current photosynthate in C nutrition of the ascocarp. Sampling of non-structural carbohydrates (NC) of above and belowground plant material indicated maximum storage of C in the host coincides with maturation of the ascocarp. These observations provide evidence of a synchronous growth habit of the plant host and the ascocarp. 

The C allocation patterns of European hazel in response to liming a loamy soil, taken from near the Hazel Hill truffi&#232;re, and inoculation with ECM fungi (T. melanosporum, Hebeloma sp. and Scleroderma sp.) were examined in a glasshouse pot trial. Liming increased biomass allocation to the shoot and induced deficiencies of phosphorus and manganese. Colonisation by ECM fungi significantly increased net photosynthesis, indicating the sink strength of these fungi, but there was no relationship between the level of mycorrhizal infection and fine root NC. The maximum rate (40 g lime kg-1 soil) reduced infection by Hebeloma and Scleroderma and had no impact on T. melanosporum. Further, infection rates of T. melanosporum did not increase in response to lime suggesting lime is not necessary for ECM development in this soil type. 

Fertiliser is widely used in commercial truffi&#232;res in Australia but the consequences for truffle production are unknown. In a field trial, the growth and physiological response of European hazel to forms of phosphorus (34 and 68 kg ha-1 apatite-P and 68 kg ha-1 triple super phosphate -P) and nitrogen (50 kg ha-1 of NO3- and NH4-N) were examined as well as the mycorrhizal response to fertiliser. Apatite-P increased phloem sap sucrose concentrations which was attributed to increased root biomass and associated sink capacity. Fertiliser application did not change fine root NC concentrations suggesting no increase in allocation of C to ECM structures. The highest rate of apatite-P decreased mycorrhizal infection rates of T. melanosporum and, most likely, was the result of increased infection rates of Hebeloma. In contrast to the literature relating to indigenous Australian ECM fungi, the highest rate of soluble-P did not decrease ECM infection rates in T. melanosporum. Nitrogen treatments increased foliar N content and improved gas exchange efficiency of plants, and had no adverse impact on the level of ECM infection. Fertilisation with N significantly increased soil respiration rates suggesting N limits mineralisation at this site. 

Some truffi&#232;res manage the canopies of the host tree to ensure maximum exposure of the soil surface in order to increase soil temperatures. As there are no published data on the effect of pruning on black truffle production, a field trial was established to document the impact of canopy pruning on host physiology and soil temperature. The removal of 65% of canopy leaf area reduced phloem sap sucrose concentrations, soil respiration rate and the soluble: insoluble NC ratio of fine roots in the short term (1-3 weeks). There was no compensatory response of leaf gas exchange parameters as a result of pruning. Generally, there was no long term impact on plant physiological parameters as a result of pruning. Long term effects on soil temperature were observed as a result of pruning. Mean annual temperature and amplitude increased significantly beneath pruned trees and spring, summer and autumn soil temperatures increased as did diurnal variation as a result of pruning. Pruning did not increase winter soil temperatures and therefore would probably not impact on ascocarp maturation during this period. 

This research has provided insight into the C physiology of hazel associated with the black truffle and the consequences for truffle production. The results provide anecdotal evidence of direct C transfer between the host and the developing truffle, contrary to the existing paradigm that the ascocarp is saprotrophic for the majority of its growth and development. There is a need to validate this finding as there are consequences for management of commercial truffi&#232;res. Liming of loam duplex soils can reduce the abundance of the most common competitor ECM fungi and should be encouraged in commercial truffi&#232;res. Applying phosphorus and nitrogen to commercial truffi&#232;res will improve growth rates of planted trees without adversely impacting on ECM infection by black truffle fungi, although the impact on truffle production remains unknown. It is anticipated truffle production will improve in the longer term as a result of pruning and prudent canopy management. Management options should include tree removal to reduce planting density and increase soil exposure in truffi&#232;res. There is a need for longer term trials to be established to determine the C nutrition of the truffle ascocarp and to clearly define the key stages of the black truffle life cycle in Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">truffles</field><field name="subject">ectomycorrhiza</field><field name="subject">Tuber</field><field name="subject">plant physiology</field><field name="subject">carbohydrates</field><field name="subject">fungal physiology</field><field name="subject">fungi</field><field name="subject">life cycle</field><field name="subject">Corylus avellana</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060327.92530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Making of a Precarious Bourgeoisie: State and the Transformation of Domestic Bourgeoisie in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">david@widi.famili.com</field><field name="description">This study focusses on the dynamics which underlie the changing relationships
between Chinese and pribumi business interests and the state. Under the Colonial
state, the indigenous bourgeoisie had been practically eliminated, not only by the
Dutch but also by priyayi bureaucrats. Consequently, Indonesia inherited a socially
and politically weak bourgeoisie dominated by the Chinese who controlled
substantial commercial networks, but had limited potential for political organisation.
In the post-colonial era, attempts to build an indigenous bourgeoisie failed and it was
the state that assumed the leading role in the economy.

Under the New Order Government, the Chinese were to play a central role in
promoting rapid economic growth and industrialisation. While this intensified
resentment in some areas, new relationships between Chinese and pribumi capital
and the state emerged. The intensifying relationship with the Chinese and pribumi
had been built primarily around business alliances between large Chinese companies
and companies owned by powerful political families. As such, cooperation remain
highly dependent upon protective policies and access to monopolies.

The unleashing of economic liberalisation resulted in the maturation of the
bourgeoisie, characterised by their increasing entry into the international market.
Conflict within business continued to evolve around the issues of conglomerates and
was largely racially based. However, other factions were to emerge between
upstream and downstream producers, between trading monopolists and producers.

The case studies in this thesis draw out the increasing complexity of pribumi-
Chinese relations. In the case of cloves we find that conflict between a Chinese
cigarette manufacturing conglomerate and apribumi trading monopolist had few
racial aspects. Rather, it was a conflict between rent-seekers and producers that was
reflected in other parts of the economy and included both pribumi and Chinese on
either side. As the economy grew and capitalism matured, issues other than race
became important. These included deregulation of trade and investment, regulation
and macro policy, with Pribumi and Chinese becoming absorbed and integrated on
either side of the various conflicts.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Bourgeoisies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060410.124416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising the Chinese Diaspora: Canadian and Australian Narratives</field><field name="creator">r.lee@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a study of Chinese diasporic narratives from Canada and Australia and examines the formation and negotiation of diasporic cultural identity and consciousness. Drawing upon theoretical discussions on diasporas in general, it investigates how the Chinese diaspora is imagined and represented, as a visible minority group, within the context of the multicultural nation state. 

This dissertation begins with a taxonomy of the modes of explaining diaspora and offers three ways of theorising diasporic consciousness. In analysing the filmic and fictional narrative forms of the Chinese in Canada and Australia, the practices of cultural self-representation and of minority group participation and enjoyment of the nation are foregrounded in order to advance critical analysis of the Chinese diaspora. While taking into account the heterogeneity of the imagined diasporic Chinese community, this study also contends that the formation and negotiation of diasporic consciousness and diasporic cultural identity politics is strongly and invariably affected by the multicultural conditions and policies of their host countries. The adaptation and manifestation of minority groups&#146; cultural practices are thus a matter of social, cultural and political contingencies more often aligned with dominant cultural expectations and manipulations than with the assertiveness of more empowered minority group participation. This dissertation therefore argues for a broader and more complex understanding of diasporic cultural and identity politics in the widespread attempts to merge and incorporate minority group narratives into the key foundational (&#145;grand&#146;) narratives of the white nation state. The importance of reinscribing Chinese diasporic histories into the cultural landscapes of their receiving countries is moreover increasingly propelled by the speed and momentum of globalisation that has resulted in the growing number of multicultural societies on the one hand but also led to the homogenisation of cultural differences and diversities.

In focussing on the fictional and filmic narratives from Canada and Australia, the diversity of the Chinese diasporic community and their conditions are emphasised in order to reflect upon the differences in the administration and practice of multiculturalism in these two countries. The comparative reading of Chinese-Canadian and Chinese-Australian novels and films locates its analysis of notions of &#145;homeland&#146; and belonging, community and national and cultural citizenship within the context of the development and negotiation of diasporic identity politics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese-Australian</field><field name="subject">Chinese-Canadian</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Cultural Citizenship</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Minority</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060418.160334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assisting Reading and Analysis of Text Documents by Visualization</field><field name="creator">rmatycorp@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The research reported here examined the use of computer generated graphics as a
means to assist humans to analyse text documents which have not been subject to
markup. The approach taken was to survey available visualization techniques in a
broad selection of disciplines including applications to text documents, group those
techniques using a taxonomy proposed in this research, then develop a selection of
techniques that assist the text analysis objective. Development of the selected techniques
from their fundamental basis, through their visualization, to their demonstration
in application, comprises most of the body of this research. A scientific orientation
employing measurements, combined with visual depiction and explanation of
the technique with limited mathematics, is used as opposed to fully utilising any one
of those resulting techniques for performing complete text document analysis.
Visualization techniques which apply directly to the text and those which exploit
measurements produced by associated techniques are considered. Both approaches
employ visualization to assist the human viewer to discover patterns which are then
used in the analysis of the document. In the measurement case, this requires consideration
of data with dimensions greater than three, which imposes a visualization
difficulty. Several techniques for overcoming this problem are proposed. Word frequencies,
Zipf considerations, parallel coordinates, colour maps, Cusum plots, and
fractal dimensions are some of the techniques considered.
One direct application of visualization to text documents is to assist reading of
that document by de-emphasising selected words by fading them on the display from
which they are read. Three word selection techniques are proposed for the automatic
selection of which words to use.
An experiment is reported which used such word fading techniques. It indicated
that some readers do have improved reading speed under such conditions, but others
do not. The experimental design enabled the separation of that group which did
decrease reading times from the remaining readers who did not. Measurement of
comprehension errors made under different types of word fading were shown not to
increase beyond that obtained under normal reading conditions.
A visualization based on categorising the words in a text document is proposed
which contrasts to visualization of measurements based on counts. The result is a
visual impression of the word composition, and the evolution of that composition
within that document.
The text documents used to demonstrates these techniques include English novels
and short stories, emails, and a series of eighteenth century newspaper articles known
as the Federalist Papers. This range of documents was needed because all analysis techniques
are not applicable to all types of documents. This research proposes that an
interactive use of the techniques on hand in a non-prescribed order can yield useful
results in a document analysis. An example of this is in author attribution, i.e. assigning
authorship of documents via patterns characteristic of an individual&#146;s writing
style. Different visual techniques can be used to explore the patterns of writing in
given text documents.
Asoftware toolkit as a platform for implementing the proposed interactive analysis
of text documents is described. How the techniques could be integrated into such a
toolkit is outlined. A prototype of software to implement such a toolkit is included
in this research. Issues relating to implementation of each technique used are also
outlined.

The long and tortuous process of federation was rendered intelligible by turning it into a narrative set around a series of key events.  For coherence and dramatic momentum the narrative dwelt on the activities of, and words of, several notable figures.  To explain the complex issues at stake it relied on memorable metaphors, images and descriptions.

Analyses of class, citizenship, or the industrial confrontations of the 1890s, are given little or no coverage in Deakinite accounts.  Collectively, these accounts are told in the words of the victors, presented in the images of the victors, clothed in the prejudices and predilections of the victors, while the losers are largely excluded.  Those who spoke out against or doubted the suitability of the constitution, for whatever reason, have largely been removed from the dominant accounts of constitution-making.  More often than not they have been &#145;character assassinated&#146; or held up to public ridicule by Alfred Deakin, the master narrator of the Conventions and federation movement and by his latter-day disciples.  Those who opposed Deakin I have labelled anti-Deakinites.

To anti-Deakinites, the journey to federation was characterised by compromises and concessions that reflected or produced a series of exclusions (of individuals, groups and ideas) from Deakinite stories of federation, often for reasons of political exigency.  They acknowledge that compromises had to be made in bringing about federation.  Men with a national viewpoint they believe, often acquiesced to states&#146; rights men whose primary interest was a good deal for their state or colony.  Anti-Deakinites are critical of the heroes in Deakinite accounts (of the Ultra-Federalists) believing that these men would have federated any time after 1891 with an undemocratic and illiberal constitution.

Events that were to influence the course of Australian history took place during the 1880-90s.  Yet the dominant accounts of constitution-making do not acknowledge the context within which the constitution was written.  It is difficult denying that these must have influenced the Constitution-makers as they began their work in 1891.  The central claim of my thesis is that many accounts of Australian constitution-making and federation have been selective in their descriptions of the events and the organisations and individuals involved, leading to the misrepresentation of these seminal episodes in Australian history.  This misrepresentation has occurred as a consequence of the privileging of, what I label, the Deakinite account of constitution-making and federation over all others.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deakinite</field><field name="subject">myth</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060502.151040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating Internet Pornography as an Issue of Sex Discrimination</field><field name="creator">M.Evans@nd.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis will critically analyse Australia&#146;s censorship laws with a specific focus on the regulation of pornography distributed via the internet, a means of mass production and distribution of pornography.

It will be argued that Australia&#146;s current censorship laws are deficient because their focus is morality based.  A morality based approach does not take into account what pornography is and does; in particular, the sex equality harms to real women  and the inequality within society caused by pornography.  

This thesis will argue that the current censorship regime is an ineffective means of regulating internet pornography because it fails to address the complexities of internet regulation and the selling and marketing of sexual inequality online.  This thesis will also argue that these censorship laws have had little or no impact in reducing the availability of pornography distributed via the internet.  

This thesis argues that a civil rights/equal opportunity approach to pornographic harm, as proposed by the anti-pornography civil rights ordinance drafted by American feminists Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin  (&#147;the ordinance&#148;), should be adopted into Australian law.  The ordinance will be examined with a particular focus on how it can be amended and incorporated into Australian equal opportunity legislation in order to more effectively regulate the distribution of pornography via the internet in a manner that addresses the harms to social inequality caused by pornography.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">pornography</field><field name="subject">censorship</field><field name="subject">obscenity</field><field name="subject">ordinance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060502.151829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young Children&#146;s Construction of &#145;RACIAL&#146; Differences in an Australian Context</field><field name="creator">A.Targowska@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to explore how some young Australian children construct their racialised ideas of difference and social relations. It adopts a qualitative method of inquiry and is based on face-to face, semi-structured interviews with a small sample of twelve Western Australian children aged three, five and seven years. 

The study adopts a relatively recent perspective on children, within which they are viewed as having an active role in their own learning process and as possessing a certain level of competence (Lloyd-Smith &amp; Tarr, 2000; James &amp; James, 2004) that allows them to &#147;comprehend, process and articulate their needs and experiences&#148; (Connolly, 1996, p.172). The study also adopts a perspective of the multiplicity of the forms of racism (Hall, 1986; Miles, 1989, 1993) and their dynamic, contingent nature, specific to different political and social contexts. Within this understanding children are viewed not just as passive recipients of racist discourses, but as active agents who, in order to make sense of their social world, strive to deal with the often contradictory nature of information received in relation to the racial Other (Rizvi, 1993a; Connolly, 1996). 

Bronfenbrenner&#146;s ecological perspective on human development adopted by this study, allows us to position the development of children&#146;s racialised thinking within the specific contexts of immediate environments (Microsystem), where children experience and create reality (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). At the same time, however, it helps us to see how the experiences within the child&#146;s environments are influenced, if not determined, by the broader social processes and institutions (Exosystem), which in many aspects reflect the ideologies (Macrosystem) of racism within Australian society (Jayasuriya, 1999).
 
The study argues that young Australian children&#146;s racialised construction of difference needs to be addressed, possibly through the development of curricula and programs with an anti-racist rather than multicultural focus. Such curricula have a potential to provide children with opportunities to look critically at the dangers of racisms and to challenge everyday racist assumptions. Further qualitative research is needed to unearth the complexities of young Australian children&#146;s racialised thought.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">racialisation of difference</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060502.152443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating Classrooom Culture Based on Democratic Values: An Exploration of a Teacher&#146;s Facilitative Role</field><field name="creator">Veronicamorcom@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to examine the teacher&#146;s facilitative role to engage students in Values Education (Curriculum Council, 1998) based on a cooperative and collaborative learning pedagogy. The study was conducted in a primary school classroom with thirty-one year 4/5 students aged 9-10 years of age. 

During the research process the core shared values underpinning the Western Australian Curriculum Framework (Curriculum Council, 1998) provided the foundation to negotiate agreements for behaviour based on The Tribes process (Gibbs, 2001), which included mutual respect, in order to foster a safe, supportive and democratic classroom culture. The Tribes process was used to operationalise the teaching of values, social skills, cooperation and collaboration. Hart&#146;s (1992) collaborative framework informed the organisation of the classroom to create the conditions that supported collaboration amongst peers and the teacher. 

An action research approach was used to reflect on the classroom context and provide a focus for a range of qualitative research methods. Multiple data sources such as teacher observations, interviews, student and teacher reflection logs and sociograms were used to triangulate findings from parents, students and teachers. A sociocultural perspective (Vygotsky, 1978) provided the conceptual framework for this study as the underlying assumption is that students learn from each other, mediated by the teacher or more capable peers. The focus on the action within the social context during the development of interpersonal relationships is a key feature of peer mediated learning, which complemented the processes chosen by the teacher researcher to elucidate how a safe, supportive and democratic classroom was created. Class meetings, group work and reflective practices were used to scaffold students&#146; understandings of interpersonal relationships to promote a culture that was consistent with Australia&#146;s democratic traditions. Reflective practices in the classroom provided opportunities for new perspectives to be developed, as new knowledge and experiences were integrated with existing personal practical knowledge.

The major findings reflected the foci of student and teacher conversations about students&#146; interpersonal skills and their ability to get along with each other. In the first phase of the study establishing positive &#145;relationships&#146; based on trust, through teambuilding activities provided the impetus for the next phase of the study about &#145;leadership&#146;. This phase continued for most of the study, and provided authentic opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, which permeated the last phase of the study about &#145;friendships&#146;. Students established mutually beneficial relationships that broadened their views about discriminatory behaviours, friendship and leadership.

The major conclusions drawn from the study is that teachers play a significant role in mediating positive relationships amongst peers. Further, it was evident that the explicit teaching of core shared values (Curriculum Council, 1998) provided the foundations of productive and active citizenship during the process of creating the conditions for a safe, supportive and democratic classroom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">facilitation</field><field name="subject">peer leadership co-operation</field><field name="subject">values</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060502.153604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;Glonacal&#146; Contexts: Internationalisation Policy in the Australian Higher Education Sector and the Development of Pathway Programs</field><field name="creator">Mfiocco@cic.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Through a critique of Ball&#146;s (1990) policy analysis framework, this dissertation explores the influences that led to the deregulation of international student recruitment (&#145;the policy&#146;) and the subsequent development of pathway programs in the Australian higher education sector. In this study Ball&#146;s framework is extended to include Marginson and Rhoades&#146; (2002) glonacal heuristic to analyse the global, national and local contexts that contributed to the creation and implementation of &#145;the policy&#146;. The development of pathway programs is chosen as one aspect of implementation to allow for an exploration that progresses from a macro to a microanalysis of &#145;the policy&#146; cycle.

The study examines the key &#145;players&#146; or individuals who contributed to &#145;the policy&#146;s&#146; creation, the ideologies that influenced these individuals and the contexts within which decisions were made. The research found that glonacal influences of neoliberalism, globalisation, internationalisation and commercialisation were paramount in the formation of &#145;the policy&#146;, and in influencing key &#145;players&#146;. It was also recognized that it was not always possible to definitively describe the role of these &#145;players&#146; or &#145;actors&#146; according to a hierarchical structure and separate contexts, confirming Ball&#146;s (1990) theory that influence on policy is often ad hoc and trajectory in nature.

Education is an export industry, which contributes an income of $5.6 billion to the Australian economy. In 2004, there were 151,798 international students in the higher education sector, with 10 Australian universities depending on this industry for 15% to 40% of their total income. The development of pathway programs and universities&#146; close association with private providers has contributed significantly to the overall commercial and internationalisation objectives of these universities. The pathway model, delivered through a private provider, examined in this study is quintessentially Australian, and was a local response to the possibilities that &#145;the policy&#146; created. The model flourished because of Commonwealth and state support, the former providing a national accreditation system in the form of the Australian Qualification Framework ensuring articulation to a university course. From a state perspective, pathway programs and private providers prospered with the support of university partners and successive Western Australian state governments that recognised the commercial gains to be made through co-operative partnerships.

The research concludes that through glonacal influences the recruitment of international students to Australian universities developed into an industry that is uniquely Australian. The development of pathway programs and the involvement of private providers was one of its distinguishing characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">internationisation</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060502.154739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reedbeds for  the treatment of greywater as an application of ecological sanitation in rural Costa Rica, Central America</field><field name="creator">S.Dallas@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The widespread practice in Latin America of separating greywater from blackwater at the domestic level lends itself to the application of Ecological Sanitation, or Ecosan. In this research simple, low-cost subsurface flow wetlands, or reedbeds, were investigated not only for their potential in treating the greywater component but also to evaluate their acceptance as an appropriate Ecosan technology in rural Central America. The hypothesis for this thesis is that Ecological Sanitation, namely via reedbeds for the treatment of greywater can improve sanitation in rural Central America. 

The first aim of this research determined that untreated greywater was having a significant negative impact on the water quality of the local streams of Monteverde in Costa Rica (the site of this research) and that the associated public health risks will continue to increase in line with population growth. Local residents expressed strong dissatisfaction with the current situation and were supportive of any means to improve it. 

The second aim of this research was to determine if reedbeds designed according to the principles of Ecosan could provide a healthier, affordable and more sustainable sanitation alternative suitable for rural areas. As a result five case study reedbed systems were designed and installed. All these reedbeds made use of locally available materials and incorporated low-maintenance design features, and research with a local plant species determined a robust macrophyte suitable for use in these systems. The ability of low-cost reedbed systems to successfully treat greywater was demonstrated. The Costa Rican guidelines for wastewater reuse were found to be overly restrictive in regards to fecal coliform limits (&lt;1,000cfu/100mL) and may inhibit the wider uptake of reedbed systems if enforced. Despite this the uptake of the reedbed technology was strong and more than ten systems were installed in Costa Rica as a result of this research. An innovative environmental services contract, the first of its kind in Costa Rica, was developed to ensure on going funding for operation and maintenance of a four-household reedbed system.

The third aim was to specifically investigate the use of waste plastic (PET) bottle segments as an alternative media in reedbeds to conventional crushed rock, or gravel. Twelve mini-reedbeds, or cells, incorporating PET media and plants as the two variables, were monitored through wet and dry seasons. This experiment demonstrated that reedbeds incorporating PET segments were able to achieve comparable removal of fecal coliform and BOD when compared to conventional media reedbeds, and at a significantly reduced cost. The local plant species Coix lacryma-jobi enhanced the performance of all reedbeds, most notably in the PET-based reedbeds, which was attributed to the considerably greater root biomass achieved in these systems as compared to conventional media systems.

This research has demonstrated that reedbeds incorporating simple, low-maintenance design features are able to provide an affordable and appropriate technology for the treatment of greywater in rural Latin America.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greywater</field><field name="subject">Ecological sanitation</field><field name="subject">Reedbeds</field><field name="subject">Constructed wetlands</field><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="subject">Sanitation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060505.100927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Breakfast, Academic Performance and Vigilance in School Aged Children</field><field name="creator">Khanabdullah@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This research was designed to investigate the relationship between breakfast habits and academic performance and vigilance in upper primary children.  The content of breakfast consumed, the frequency of skipping breakfast, gender differences, social impacts and reasons for skipping breakfast in upper primary school children are also examined. There is little Australian research on children&#146;s breakfast habits or its relationship with academic performance and vigilance. Hence there is a need for research on this issue in the Australian context. 
The study involved 72 children of 5th, 6th and 7th grades from two schools in Western Australia. Data were obtained in three ways (a) the children completed a questionnaire which explored their breakfast habits, (b) the class teachers recorded the classroom performance/grades based on their classroom evaluations, and behaviour of the children based on the observations, and (c) the children were then given three vigilance tasks approximately one and a half hours into the school day. The children were divided into breakfast and no-breakfast groups based on the self-report of breakfast consumption on that day.
The study found that more than half of the children at least sometimes skip their breakfast, with no differences attributed to gender. A number of children reported eating breakfast on the way to school but the proportion of those having a nutritious breakfast on the way to school was almost negligible. Even those having breakfast regularly (55%) might not be consuming a nutritious breakfast. Children reported feeling sleepy, inactive and forgetful as a consequence of skipping breakfast on the day. Reasons offered for skipping mainly had to do with personal choice and convenience, rather than with dieting and concern about body shape. There was no relationship found between breakfast skipping and academic performance and vigilance. Evidence that breakfast skipping affects concentration span of children was found for year 6 and 7 students in the study. 
Potential strategies based on the findings of this study are discussed. Providing a nutritious breakfast for children or supplementing their daily diets with fruit are interventions which have the potential to make a significant impact on children&#146;s health and well-being. In order to have a nutritious breakfast, children should be encouraged to have breakfast at home before leaving for school as they usually tend to eat a less nutritious breakfast on the way to school or at school. Organizing a breakfast day at school will also promote the importance of having breakfast. Further emphasis on nutrition and healthy eating in schools could make a difference.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060505.150942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Television and Positive Ageing in Australia</field><field name="creator">J.Hall@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As a means to engage with others, television offers the viewer a great deal. In Australia commercial TV is particularly popular, and many turn daily to this cultural arena which graphically portrays our shared concerns and values. Viewers are kept informed and entertained, advertisements display the luxuries and necessities that direct lifestyle choices,and local and global stories are presented for mutual consideration. Audiences are connected not only with products,personalities and newsmakers, but also with fellow viewers who are sharing the experience. Retired people take particular advantage of this multi-faceted link with the outside world, when additional leisure time and reduced social and physical mobility create spaces that can be filled with the narratives and 'para-social' connections of a medium that transports the world to the viewer. Yet one definitive statement that can be made about popular television is that older people are rarely acknowledged and often ridiculed. An easily accessible and valuable communications medium marginalises those most dependent upon it - for information and entertainment, but also, I would argue, dependent upon it to help facilitate key recommendations of the 'successful ageing' formula.

Authoritative prescriptions for ageing well emphasise the benefits of social engagement, with television helping to facilitate this by involving the viewer with local concerns and wider accounts of human enterprise. Yet the popular media often presume that older people are no longer viable consumers or citizens, thus alienating them from mediated stories and populations. 'Success', according to commercial media sensibilities, is equated with youthfulness and economic means - twin attributes rarely associated with retired people. As a result, advertising is directed primarily at young, middle-class audiences, and the TV programmes to hook their attention are often typecast with similarly youthful protagonists. Older viewers are taken for granted and rarely acknowledged, and more disconcertingly, stereotyped and ridiculed to empower younger viewers. This dissertation seeks to explore these issues from a sociological perspective, primarily within the Australian context. Research strategies include a detailed analysis of the role of television in older people's lives and how they are portrayed, with results aligned with 'successful ageing' guidelines. Included in this approach is a study of how older people are portrayed on commercial TV in Australia, and a discussion of findings. The final section includes a chapter which consists of an examination of negative media portrayals from a political and human rights perspective, and the final chapter which asks how the oldest and frailest may by impacted by the cultural devaluation of old age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">positive ageing</field><field name="subject">media representation of age</field><field name="subject">television and social groups</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060505.151605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of low temperature on boron nutrition of oilseed rape and sunflower</field><field name="creator">Zhengqian Ye</field><field name="description">Several reports appear in the literature linking low temperature damage in plants with boron (B) deficiency and alleviation of low temperature injury with B application has been reported in some crops and trees. These results imply that low temperature might increase plant B requirements, beside the reduction of B uptake by plant roots, or that low B tissues might be more sensitive to cold temperature damage than B adequate tissues. In controlled experiments, it has been shown that low root zone temperature (RZT) induces B deficiency in cassava, a tropical root crop. Apart from this, there are few definitive detailed investigations on low temperature effects on B nutrition of plants, including temperate species which are more tolerant of low temperature.

Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), a crop sensitive to low B supply, is a major crop in the middle and lower Yangtse river basin, China, where low B soils are widespread. Appearance of B deficiency in oilseed rape often coincides with cold weather during its winter and spring growth. However, the incidence and severity of B deficiency of oilseed rape plants and the efficacy of B fertilization varies from year to year and location to location in ways that are not explained simply by differences in cultivar, agronomy or soil B levels. Low temperature is probably one of the important environmental factors influencing growth and yield of oilseed rape in relation to B nutrition.

Therefore,the objective of the studies in this thesis was to investigate mechanisms of low temperature effects on B nutrition of plants with emphasis on oilseed rape. Field and glasshouse experiments were carried out and the physiological basis of plant response to B at different air and root temperatures is discussed. 

A field experiment with oilseed rape cv. Zheyouyou 2 was carried out on a red soil (Hapludult, US Soil Taxonomy) with low B availability in Zhejiang province, China. Canopy covers made from transparent plastic sheets, which increased night temperatures by up to 1.5 oC around shoots for 15 days in early February, strongly increased shoot dry weight at all levels of B supply. Furthermore, covering plants increased shoot dry weight of B deficient plants without increasing their leaf B concentration. This suggests that internal B requirements were decreased by canopy covering, possibly due to higher temperatures within the canopy.

Experiments conducted to investigate the effect of RZT (10 and 20&#131;n oC) on oilseed rape cv. Hyola 42 response to B in solution culture, in summer and winter, showed that regardless of canopy conditions, low RZT (10 oC) promoted the distribution of shoot B towards the actively growing leaves, especially when B supply was low. At low B supply, B deficiency symptoms appeared later at 10 oC than 20 oC RZT and B concentrations in the youngest fully opened leaves (YOL) were higher in plants grown at RZT of 10 oC than that at 20 oC. Growth of plant dry weight (DW) was not affected

by RZT in the summer but was greatly reduced at 10 oC than 20 oC in winter. In B adequate plants, shoot to root ratio (S/R ratio) was not affected by RZT regardless of canopy conditions. By contrast, S/R ratio was smaller in low B plants at 10 oC than 20 oC. In addition, low RZT delayed occurrence of plant B deficiency symptoms regardless of plants&#161;&#166; pre-treatment RZT (either 10 or 20 oC). These results appeared to contradict the response to low RZT found in previous studies with cassava.

In a subsequent experiment, low RZT of 5 oC not only greatly reduced plant DW production of oilseed rape, but also accentuated plant B deficiency. Partitioning of B into the young growing shoots was also depressed and a significant decrease of B concentration in the youngest shoot parts was caused by 5 oC RZT in comparison with that at the control RZT (10 oC). Similar results were also observed in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Hysun 25). But B deficiency symptoms in sunflower were induced by RZT as high as 12 oC, when plants were supplied with 0.25 &#163;gM B, whilst these plants were free from B deficiency at warmer RZT (17 - 27 oC). Higher external B concentrations were required at such RZT (Chilling temperature) for plant growth free from B deficiency. Therefore, there is a RZT threshold below which an increased response to B is expected in plants of oilseed rape and sunflower. And in the range of chilling RZT, the external B requirement for shoot growth increased with lower RZT. The threshold RZT was considerably higher in the chilling-sensitive plant species, sunflower, than in oilseed rape, a chilling-resistant plant species.

At chilling RZT, leaf functioning was impaired by low B supply as measured by potassium (K) leakage from the youngest mature leaf blade (YML) of sunflower, whereas it was much less directly affected by RZT, and there was no effect of RZT on B- adequate plants. By contrast to leaves, root function was impaired more by chilling RZT than low B.

Despite their different threshold RZT, in both oilseed rape and sunflower, the rates of B uptake (BUR) and B translocation from root to shoot (BTR) were dramatically depressed by chilling RZT especially at low B supply (0.2 &#163;gM B): being only 30% of those at the control (5 oC vs 10 oC RZT) in oilseed rape and 33% (10 oC vs 20 oC RZT) in sunflower, respectively. By contrast, there was little or no difference over a range of warmer RZT (10 - 20 oC for oilseed rape, and 20 &#161;V 27 oC for sunflower). It is predicted that higher rates of B application will be required for plant growth when soil temperature is below a critical threshold, which is between 5 and 10 oC for oilseed rape, and about 17 oC for sunflower, respectively. Below the threshold RZT plant B deficiency was induced and accentuated due to impairment of B translocation into growing shoot parts besides the decrease of B uptake rate and B transport rate and greater shoot to root ratio.

In comparison with RZT, little is known about causal mechanisms linking cold air temperature and B nutrition. Experiments in this thesis showed not only B transport to the shoot was strongly reduced by low night air temperature during a 6 day period (11.719.4 vs 15.5 &#161;V 23.5 oC), but also that an overnight chilling (at 0 oC) could cause more severe injury to low B than adequate B leaves of oilseed rape plants, expressed by higher solute leakage, in comparison with control (at 10 oC). Moreover, after chilling treatment, solute leakage from low B leaves was increased by exposure to light, which suggests that low temperature injury to leaves in low B plants after a freezing night in the field is at least partly a consequence of light induced damage of leaves.

In summary, at chilling temperature, B uptake, transport and partitioning into growing shoots are strongly impaired, and B use efficiency in the growing tissues might be reduced as well. Low temperature contributes to plant B deficiency also by increasing S/R ratio, so that shoot B demand is not satisfied by available B. Furthermore, low air temperature might increase the internal B requirement for shoot growth. To further understand mechanisms of low temperature, especially the air temperature, effects on plant responses to B, more research is needed, such as the relationship between low temperature and B incorporation into cell walls which may play an important role in leaf tolerance to chilling temperature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rape</field><field name="subject">Sunflowers</field><field name="subject">Oilseed plants</field><field name="subject">Boron in plant nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060510.154332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sea Turtles and the Environmental Management of Industrial Activities in North West Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Pendoley@newton.dialix.com.au</field><field name="description">The nesting demographics of sea turtles using beaches within the Barrow, Lowendal,
Montebello (B-L-M) island complex on the North West Shelf of Western Australia were
examined in the context of their spatial and temporal distribution and potential for
exposure to industrially based artificial light sources. The distribution of overnight turtle
tracks throughout the island complex confirmed high density nesting of Chelonia mydas
(green turtles) on deep, sandy and high energy beaches and Natator depressus
(flatback turtles) on deep, sandy and low energy beaches, while Eretmochelys
imbricata (hawksbill turtle) tracks were most visible on shallow, sandy beaches
adjacent to near shore coral reef habitat. The three species exhibited a summer
nesting peak. Hawksbill turtles commenced nesting in September and continued
through to January, green turtles commenced in November and decreased in March.
Flatback turtles displayed the most constrained nesting season reported to date in
Australia with 86% of the animals visits recorded in December and January only.
Nesting population sizes estimated for the three species suggest that on a national
scale the B-L-M complex is a moderately large green turtle and a large flatback rookery
site. The hawksbill rookery is large on an international scale. While none of the green
turtle nesting beaches fell within a 1.5 km radius of industrially based artificial light
sources an estimated 42% of nesting flatback turtles and 12% of nesting hawksbill
turtles were potentially exposed to these light sources.
Testing of green turtle and hawksbill hatchling response to different wavelengths of
light indicate that hatchlings from the B-L-M region respond to low wavelength much
like hatchlings tested in North America (Witherington 1992a). Flatback hatchlings
displayed a similar preference for low wavelength light however their responses to
discrete light wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm suggest that this species may
not discriminate well between wavelengths that lie between 450 nm and 550 nm. This
response may be related to the rapid attenuation of visible light that occurs in the turbid
near shore habitats favoured by this species.
Field based arena studies carried out to investigate hatchling behaviour on nesting
beaches with light types commonly used in industrial settings found green turtle and
flatback hatchlings are significantly attracted to these lights compared to controls.
Lights that emit strongly in the low wavelength range (i.e. metal halide and fluorescent)
caused hatchling misorientation at lower intensities than the test light that emitted
relatively poorly in this range (high pressure sodium vapour). Hawksbill hatchlings
tested in situ under the influence of actual oil and gas onshore and offshore facility
based lighting were disrupted from the most direct line to the ocean by these light
emissions. Emergence fan mapping methods that measure hatchling orientation on
nesting beaches were refined and are proposed as an alternative monitoring tool for
use on beaches that are logistically difficult to access for large scale experimental
orientation studies. The hatchling behaviour was clearly complicated by beach
topography and moon phase.
Satellite tracking of post nesting female green and hawksbill turtles from North West
Shelf rookeries has identified the Western Australian location of migratory corridors and
foraging grounds for these species while Scott Reef turtles migrate from their south
Timor Sea rookery to Northern Territory waters. Green turtle nesting on Barrow Island
and Sandy Island (Scott Reef) forage at feeding grounds 200 &#150; 1000 km from their
nesting beaches. Hawksbill turtles nesting at Varanus Island and Rosemary Islands
forage at locations 50 &#150; 450 km from their nesting beaches. While all of the nesting
beaches within the B-L-M island complex are protected under the Barrow-Montebello
Marine Conservation Reserves, the only foraging ground similarly protected is the

This thesis argues that UMNO factionalism, which is seemingly a power struggle between competing UMNO elites, has been significantly shaped by contesting nationalist ideologies that reflect the unresolved questions of national identity in Malaysia. 
These two issues, that is, nationalism and UMNO factionalism, have shaped Malaysian politics in significant ways. UMNO factionalism has been related to such major political events as the 1969 ethnic riots, the introduction of the New Economic Policy, the UMNO split in 1987 and the Reformasi (Reform) movement in 1998. Frequently, the impact of these disputes extended beyond UMNO politics and affected wider Malaysian politics. At the same time, due to unresolved questions of national identity, nationalism has occupied a central position in Malaysian political discourse. There are ambiguities regarding the relationships among the various ethnic identities and national identity and between the individual and the larger Malaysian community that enable elites to construct and manipulate nationalist ideologies. In this thesis, the conflicting nationalisms are captured by five different concepts of nationalism &#150; ethnocultural, civic and multicultural nationalisms in one group and collectivist-authoritarian and individualistic-libertarian nationalisms in another. 
The Malaysian Prime Ministers have constructed nationalist ideology to define the Malaysian nation in their attempts to resolve the unresolved problems of national identity. The challengers&#146; arguments, to mobilise the community, mirror the community&#146;s (negative) responses to the Malaysian Prime Ministers&#146; nationalist visions. In addition, the ideological arguments in the disputes extend the dispute beyond the elites, involving the community as well. Furthermore, because of the ideological conflicts, these factional disputes affect the direction of government policies in significant ways. This study shows that UMNO factional disputes have followed this pattern of ideological conflicts, although the exact contents may vary. 
The 1969 factional dispute was a clash between Tunku Abdul Rahman&#146;s shift towards multicultural nationalism and its challengers&#146; ethnocultural nationalism. Tunku Abdul Rahman&#146;s nationalist vision moved away from ethnocultural nationalism in pursuit of national integration. The challengers, reflecting the Malay community&#146;s response to the Prime Minister&#146;s vision, took a strong ethnocultural Malay nationalist stance. The successful mobilisation of the Malay community by ethnocultural Malay nationalists contributed to the policy shift towards ethnocultural nationalism in the 1970s. In the 1987 dispute, Mahathir&#146;s economic policy, which moved away from ethnocultural nationalism, was challenged by Razaleigh&#146;s ethnocultural nationalist argument. After the dispute, Mahathir could only mobilise the community by tactically employing the rhetoric of ethnocultural Malay nationalism. 
In the 1990s, Mahathir&#146;s attempt to define the national identity of Malaysia by constructing a civic Malaysian nation, Bangsa Malaysia, relieved the tension surrounding the ambiguous national identity of Malaysia. It was facilitated by rapid economic growth that ameliorated ethnic contests over limited economic resources. However, the collectivist-authoritarian aspect of Mahathir&#146;s nationalism raised another nationalist question concerning the subordination of individual liberty and rights to the collective community&#146;s will and interests &#150; a nationalism that justified his authoritarian rule. There was tension between an increasingly confident civic Malaysian society and Mahathir&#146;s collectivist-authoritarian control of the society. The 1998 UMNO dispute was a clash between Mahathir&#146;s collectivist-authoritarian nationalism and Anwar Ibrahim&#146;s individualistic-libertarian nationalism. The latter attempted to mobilise Malaysian society with his nationalist position (the Reformasi movement) which was expressed in the demand for liberal political reform. After the dispute, Mahathir was able to regain lost political ground through the politics of fear. It seems, however, that the fundamental question remains unresolved. This unresolved tension between the demand for individual liberty and rights and authoritarian control by state elites is likely to shape the ideological arguments in future UMNO factional disputes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">malaysia</field><field name="subject">UMNO</field><field name="subject">factionalism</field><field name="subject">Mahathir Mohamed</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060612.120537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal Emotional Responses in Violent Offenders: (Re) examining the role of Empathy.</field><field name="creator">J.Beven@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The study of empathy has had a long history in both psychology and philosophy; however, debate has continued in relation to the exact nature of the construct. Several distinct variants of empathy have evolved over time, with some researchers viewing the construct as cognitive, while others emphasise the affective nature of empathy.  An examination of the history of the construct reveals evidence which supports both positions.  Multidimensional models of empathy, such as that posed by Davis (1994), encompass both cognitive and affective accounts of empathy, as well as their interaction.  Despite the apparent acceptance of multidimensional models of empathy, confusion still remains as to the definition of empathy. This has restrained theories of the relationship between empathy and constructs such as aggression.

The current program of study sought to clarify the relationship between aggression and empathy, focusing on a multidimensional approach.  It was argued that previous research relied on the assumed inhibitory nature of empathy on aggression, and although intuitive, had failed to acknowledge alternative explanations for a relationship between empathy and aggression.  Three possible explanations to account for a possible relationship between empathy and aggression were therefore examined. 
firstly, that the distress cues of another produce distress in the observer (personal distress) and that distress is interpreted as aversive. Personal distress produces a drive to reduce the aversive state which may result in the use of violence by some individuals.  (Empathic arousal functioning as a facilitator of aggression);
secondly, that the distress cues of another fail to produce an affective reaction in some observers. (Empathic arousal failing to function as an inhibitor of aggression); and
thirdly, that the distress cues of another produce an affective reaction in some observers, which is interpreted as an excitation (contrast empathy), and functions to reinforce the use of violence. (Empathic arousal functioning as a facilitator of aggression).

During phase 1 of the research the psychometric properties of the empathy measure, currently used with offenders, were examined in an offender sample.  Results from 88 violent offenders indicated that the measure was not suitable for use with offender samples, and therefore new scales needed to be produced before research could continue.  Two scales were constructed; the Negative Affect Intolerance Scale (NAIS) assessed offenders&#146; level of intolerance toward distress cues of others, while the Offender Contrast Affect Scale (OCAS) assessed offenders&#146; level of excitation and enjoyment of the distress cues of others.  Once scale construction had been complete, the psychometric properties of the scales were examined using sample of 166 university students.  These preliminary results indicated that both scales were reliable and valid.

Phase 2 of the research program began with a pilot study to examine the psychometric properties of the two newly constructed scales with sample of 49 incarcerated male offenders.  Both scales once again produced results which supported their reliability and validity.  A larger study was then conducted to examine the three theorised roles that empathy may play in either the production or maintenance of aggression.  Cluster analysis identified 5 clusters in a sample of 106 sentenced male offenders, based on their responses to a set of scales (including the NAIS and OCAS).  Each of these clusters was compared to a Western Australian community sample (43 low SES males).  Results supported all three explanations of a relationship between empathy and aggression, within different clusters of offenders.

The final phase of research involved postulating a theoretical role for cognitive aspects of empathy (perspective taking) in the production or inhibition of aggression.  It was argued that, despite the apparent simplicity with which the construct has been dealt with in the literature, perspective taking should be considered a two dimensional construct (frequency &amp; accuracy).  When considered in this way, perspective taking may provide additional guidance in the study and treatment of human aggression</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">offenders</field><field name="subject">empathy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060612.121317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Declared guilty, a never-ending story : an analysis of the impact of the criminal justice system upon the self</field><field name="creator">bsteels@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This study explores the experience of people who have been publicly declared guilty. It retells the narratives of offenders from the point of arrest through to conviction and, where relevant, imprisonment and release. The experiences of close relatives are also explored and provide an important part of the thesis. These accounts are set against the institutional context of the criminal justice system and a systemic account of police, courts, prisons and community corrections is provided. The main aim of the study is to investigate and document the impact of the criminal justice process on offenders&#146; sense of &#145;self&#146;.  

At a theoretical level, the study is informed by symbolic interactionism, particularly the work of Erving Goffman. This enables the development of insights into issues such as loss, shame, humiliation and loss of self. The asymmetrical power relationship in which these feelings are engendered and maintained is emphasised. At the same time, the study records the level and types of resistance among the subjects of the criminal justice system.

The findings are significant for our sociological understandings of the impact of being declared guilty, for they suggest that the criminal justice process per se contributes to a severely damaged self, and that the subjective experience of &#145;being found guilty&#146; starts at the moment of arrest and persists well after sentencing as subjects try to re-integrate into the community with a record of conviction. 

The study also suggests that these processes are not passively absorbed by subjects. As well as describing feelings of shame and loss, those participating in the research talked about the unfairness of the system, their preparedness to resist in numerous ways, and of their longing for an older, better life in which their sense of self was undamaged. 

The study concludes by arguing that profound change to the culture of the criminal justice system is needed if rehabilitation is to be successful. In this context it emphasises the importance of accountable and transparent human services concerned with the human and civil rights of offenders, court diversion schemes, alternatives to custody, and the practical application of restorative and therapeutic justice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criminal justice</field><field name="subject">Criminals</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060615.125712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to greenhouse gas reduction : U.S. and Australian perspectives</field><field name="creator">19770984@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Fossil fuel&#150;intensive companies are coming under increasing pressure to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The political environment surrounding climate change and the evolution of the carbon market are complex and in a fluid state of play. Uncertainty exists with respect to government policy, greenhouse (GH) accounting standards, interaction with stakeholders and the capacity to &#145;commoditise&#146; carbon emissions, making it difficult for companies to determine exactly how to build their internal capacity to deal with a shifting external situation.

In Australia and the United States in particular, companies are receiving mixed messages from government about the necessity of reducing GHGs and the role of emissions trading. While market-based approaches to GHG reduction are being promoted, the governments of both countries have refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and failed to establish domestic emissions trading schemes. Finally, few companies have substantial experience in managing GHGs or in market-based approaches to GHG abatement, such as emissions trading.

This research aims to provide guidance for industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to GHG reduction, recognising that generally this would require significant organisational learning and change to corporate systems. The proposed Framework facilitates organisational learning that goes beyond the detection and correction of errors to questioning and modifying existing norms and procedures and, further, to reflecting on past experience and creating new strategies.

The research included participants as integral to the study, giving their &#145;emic&#146; (insider) viewpoints centrality while allowing &#145;etic&#146; (outsider / researcher) interpretation. Within the organisational learning literature, the approach that best describes this research is that of Action Research and Appreciative Inquiry. The principles of environmental management, cleaner production, corporate social responsibility and sustainable development inform the research. Surveys, focus groups and a literature review are employed as the data collection methods, which are compared and contrasted.

The data suggest that a &#145;one size fits all&#146; approach to industry capacity building with respect to market-based approaches to GHG reduction is not optimal or possible. This is due to the differing strategic objectives, varying assessment of risk and disparate circumstances and starting points of the companies involved. Thus, rather than a prescriptive model, this research has identified and prioritised the key themes and issues that currently influence corporate capacity building. Precursors to action have been specified and a &#145;menu&#146; of choices provided. Lastly, a step-by-step Framework has been proposed to build companies&#146; capacity to participate in GHG emissions trading. It was also observed that the majority of the key themes and issues that influence companies and the preparatory actions they need to take are the same, whether a market-based system or a command-and-control system of GHG reduction is introduced. 

The thesis includes some suggestions for further research in the application and evaluation of this approach with companies in the field.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial capacity</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse</field><field name="subject">Gas</field><field name="subject">Mitigation</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060615.132356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome sequence of bacteriophage &#214;AR29 : a basis for integrative plasmid vectors</field><field name="creator">shawnseet@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The initial aim of this project was to characterise the integrative recombination mechanism of bacteriophage &#214;AR29 , to provide a better understanding for development of the shuttle plasmid pBA as a site-specific Bacteroides integration vector. RT-PCR showed that the previously identified &#214;AR29 recombination genes, integrase (Int) and excisionase (Xis), were transcribed from pBA in E. coli SCS110, B. thetaiotaomicron AR29 and B. uniformis AR20. In silico derived amino acid sequences from both genes showed only very low levels of similarity to other known Int and Xis in GenBank. To improve understanding of the phage recombination system, the &#214;AR29 genome was sequenced. This revealed a 35,558 bp double-stranded DNA genome with GC content of 39.11%. Bioinformatic analysis identified 53 open reading frames (&gt;30 codons) and gene promoters and terminators that allowed the genome arrangement to be compared with other phages. Comparison of deduced gene products with proteins from other phages identified 6 reading frames, allowed tentative identification of 7 others, but left 40 ORFs unidentified. Those with strong homology to known genes were: large terminase subunit (44.66 kDa), dnaC (27.94 kDa), helix-turn-helix (HTH) transcription regulator (14.69 kDa), cI repressor (26.48 kDa), amidase (18.42kDa) and a novel integrase (54.22 kDa). The integrase gene is located 162 base-pairs downstream of the phage attachment (attP) core site, rather than the previously suggested location upstream of the integration site. The &#214;AR29 attP was shown to include a 16-bp att core region, 117 bp upstream of the previously suggested location. Integration of &#214;AR29  was found to occur at the 3&#146;end of an arg-tRNA gene on the AR29 genome (attB). Imperfect direct repeats with a consensus sequence (ANGTTGTGCAA) were found surrounding the attP core. A review of pBA sequence showed that only the 5&#146; end (435 bp) of the newly identified Int gene was cloned in pBA. Despite this, PCR analysis revealed integration of pBA into the AR29 genome. Serial subculturing of pBA transformed AR29 was able to cure AR29 of the &#214;AR29 prophage, providing an improved host for integrative plasmids, and for detailed studies of AR29 physiology and &#214;AR29 life cycles.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacteriophages</field><field name="subject">Genetic vectors</field><field name="subject">Plasmids</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060615.135718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competing Myths of Nationalist Identity: Ideological Perceptions of Conflict in Ambon, Indonesia.</field><field name="creator">kathleenturner@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the 1999&#150;2003 case of political conflict in Ambon, in Eastern Indonesia, in the context of political change in Indonesia from 1950-1998. It is argued that political transformation during this period was closely influenced by a much longer period of unprecedented social change preceding the politics of this period. It is suggested that the ideologisation of ethnic identities is likely to occur when structures of community are disrupted by changes in the contemporary world such as economic fluctuations or state policy interventions. One result is to disrupt traditional village communities so as to place individuals in stress situations making them susceptible to new nationalist ideologies. The other impact is to dislocate authority structures so that both incumbent and aspiring elites lose their power and authority and thus search for new ways in order to re-establish their moral and political legitimacy.

It is argued that nationalism is able to offer a resolution to social disruption and thus to the community in search of social cohesion, while also functioning to rebuild elite authority. In ethnic nationalist ideology, insecurities and feelings of isolation are ameliorated by subsequent constructions of &#145;us&#146; and &#145;them&#146; where members of one distinct community are demarcated from other communities. It is suggested that myths of ancestry and homeland together with counterposed moral dichotomies appealed to the Ambonese who needed this form of ideological support. It is the insecurities and fear experienced by disrupted communities which promote this powerful ideological formula.  

It is asserted that conflict on the island has been characterised by this trend towards ideological absolutism where two conflicting ideological constructions have translated the conflict into a non-negotiable confrontation between opposing national rights. It is argued that these two ideological constructions have remained internalised on the island and embedded within the mindsets of both Ambonese Christians and Muslims, thereby rendering setbacks to conflict resolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ambon</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">nationalism</field><field name="subject">Laskar Jihad</field><field name="subject">RMS</field><field name="subject">Moluccas</field><field name="subject">Maluku</field><field name="subject">ethnic conflict</field><field name="subject">FKM</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060713.204930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of the form and level of organic versus inorganic copper and zinc in diets for growing and finishing pigs</field><field name="creator">A.Hernandez@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Pharmacological levels of inorganic forms of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are frequently used in diets for pigs to improve performance and control post-weaning colibacillosis. However, the use of such forms and levels causes mineral accumulation in the soil, and is a non-sustainable practice from an environmental perspective. Alternatively, organic complexes of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) have been proposed to be more available to pigs, and when included at lower levels than inorganic sources of these minerals have significantly reduced mineral excretion in faeces without compromising performance. However the effect of these organic minerals fed simultaneously at low levels of inclusion has not been well studied. The general hypothesis tested in this thesis was that concentrations of Cu and Zn in faecal material would be reduced when fed in an organic (Bioplex&#174;) form without compromising performance or mineral homeostasis in growing/finishing pigs, in comparison to Cu and Zn fed in an inorganic (sulphate) form.   

Two experiments were performed to test this hypothesis: Experiment 1 was designed as a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments, with two mineral forms (Bioplex&#174; and Sulphate) and two inclusion levels (High and Low). The &#147;low&#148; levels aimed at providing 80 mg/kg of dietary Cu and Zn, and the &#147;high&#148; levels aimed at providing 160 mg/kg of dietary Cu and Zn. Experiment 2 was designed as a 3x2 factorial arrangement of treatments, with two mineral forms (Bioplex&#174; and Sulphate) and three inclusion levels (Low, Medium and High). The &#147;low&#148; levels aimed at providing 25 mg/kg of Cu and 40 mg/kg of Zn, the &#147;medium&#148; levels aimed at providing 80 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn, and the &#147;high&#148; levels aimed at providing 160 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn in the diet. Unfortunately the Medium sulphate grower diet was contaminated with excess Zn while manufacturing, which led to the exclusion of this treatment from the study.  

In Experiment 1, pigs fed LB (Low Bioplex&#174;) or HS (High Sulphate) diets grew faster (P=0.014) and their carcasses were 3.5 kg heavier (P=0.020) than LS (Low Sulphate)- or HB (High Bioplex&#174;)-fed pigs. Pigs fed LB or HS diets had lower (P=0.001) levels of Zn in plasma, a higher (P=0.029) concentration of Zn in the pancreas and a lower (P=0.020) concentration of Zn in bone than pigs fed LS or HB diets. The concentration of Cu in liver increased (P=0.017) with the concentration in the diet as did Cu and Zn levels in faeces (P&lt;0.001) without any difference between mineral forms. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) tended to be improved (P=0.062) by the inclusion of Bioplex&#174; in the diet. The inclusion of Bioplex&#174; reduced (P=0.003) subcutaneous fat depth at the P2 site by 2.2 mm compared to the sulphate. In Experiment 2, there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in growth rate between experimental diets, but again there was an overall improvement (P=0.012) in FCR when Bioplex&#174; were included. Blood and tissue Cu and Zn concentrations were within normal physiological ranges in all treatments, supporting a reduction of Cu and Zn levels in the diet. Only Zn level in plasma during the growing phase and Cu and Zn concentration in tissues increased (P&lt;0.001) with the addition in the diet. None of the biomarkers of Cu or Zn status analysed in the pigs showed any difference between the inorganic and the Bioplex&#174; forms. Copper and Zn concentrations in faecal material decreased (P&lt;0.001) with their inclusion in the diet, and only in the finishing collection there was a further decrease of 10% in Zn faecal concentration when Bioplex&#174; was included instead of the sulphate at similar low levels. Carcass and meat quality measures were independent of the Cu and Zn form or level, however a higher proportion of carcasses from LB-fed pigs had &lt;14 mm subcutaneous fat depth at the P2 site. The inclusion of Bioplex&#174; failed to have a significant effect on Cu excretion and its inclusion had an inconsistent effect on Zn excretion. 

The overall findings from this thesis partially supported the hypothesis that the inclusion of Bioplex&#174; would reduce the concentration of Cu and Zn in faeces compared to the inclusion of inorganic forms at similar inclusion levels. Nevertheless, total Cu and Zn levels in growing/finishing pig diets could be reduced from 160 mg/kg of both Cu and Zn to 30 mg/kg Cu and 60 mg/kg Zn, in either the sulphate or the Bioplex&#174; form, without negatively affecting performance or mineral homeostasis in the pigs and significantly reducing Cu and Zn excretion (between 50 and 80%). The advantage of including Bioplex&#174; instead of sulphates was in the improvement in FCR. Carcass and meat quality were independent of the form and level of dietary Cu and Zn.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pigs</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">growth performance</field><field name="subject">mineral excretion</field><field name="subject">carcass</field><field name="subject">meat quality</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060727.122557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saprophytic ability and the contribution of chlamydospores and oospores to the survival of Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="creator">kathrynmccarren@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi has been recognised as a key threatening process to Australia&#146;s biodiversity by the Commonwealth&#146;s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.  Despite over 80 years of extensive research, its exact mode of survival is still poorly understood.  It is widely accepted that thin- and thick-walled chlamydospores are the main survival propagules while oospores are assumed to play no role in the survival of the pathogen in the Australian environment, yet evidence is limited.  The saprophytic ability of the pathogen is still unresolved despite the important role this could play in the ability of the pathogen to survive in the absence of susceptible hosts.  This thesis aimed to investigate chlamydospores, oospores and the saprophytic ability of P. cinnamomi to determine their contribution to survival.       

Phytophthora cinnamomi did not show saprophytic ability in non-sterile soils.  The production of thick-walled chlamydospores and selfed oospores of P. cinnamomi in vitro was documented.  Thick-walled chlamydospores were sporadically formed under sterile and non-sterile conditions in vitro but exact conditions for stimulating their formation could not be determined.  The formation of thick-walled chlamydospores emerging from mycelium of similar wall thickness was observed, challenging the current knowledge of chlamydospore formation.  

Selfed oospores were abundant in vitro on modified Ribeiro&#146;s minimal medium in one isolate.  Three other isolates tested also produced oospores but not in large numbers.  Although the selfed oospores did not germinate on a range of media, at least 16 % were found to be viable using Thiozolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide staining and staining of the nuclei with 4&#180;, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.2HCl (DAPI).  This indicated the potential of selfed oospores as survival structures and their ability to exist dormantly.  

The ability of phosphite to kill chlamydospores and selfed oospores was studied in vitro.  Results challenged the efficacy of this chemical and revealed the necessity for further study of its effect on survival propagules of P. cinnamomi in the natural environment.  Phosphite was shown to induce dormancy in thin-walled chlamydospores if present during their formation in vitro.  Interestingly, dormancy was only induced by phosphite in isolates previously reported as sensitive to phosphite and not those reported as tolerant.  

Chlamydospores were produced uniformly across the radius of the colony on control modified Ribeiro&#146;s minimal medium but on medium containing phosphite (40 or 100 &#181;g ml-1), chlamydospore production was initially inhibited before being stimulated during the log phase of growth.  This corresponded to a point in the colony morphology where mycelial density changed from tightly packed mycelium to sparse on medium containing phosphite.  This change in morphology did not occur when the pathogen was grown on liquid media refreshed every four days, and chlamydospores were evenly distributed across the radius of these colonies.  This trend was not observed in selfed oospores produced in the presence of phosphite.  Selfed oospore production was found to be inhibited by phosphite at the same concentrations that stimulated chlamydospore production.  
  
Isolates of P. cinnamomi were transformed using a protoplast/ polyethylene glycol method to contain the Green Fluorescent Protein and geneticin resistance genes to aid in future studies on survival properties of the organism.  Although time constraints meant the stability of the transgene could not be determined, it was effective in differentiating propagules of the transformed P. cinnamomi from spores of other microrganisms in a non-sterile environment.  Two different sized chlamydospores (approximately 30 &#181;m diameter and &lt; 20 &#181;m diameter) were observed in preliminary trials of transformed P. cinnamomi inoculated lupin roots floated in non-sterile soil extracts and these were easily distinguished from microbial propagules of other species.  The growth and pathogenicity was reduced in two putative transformants and their ability to fluoresce declined over ten subcultures but they still remained resistant to geneticin.  

This study has improved our knowledge on the survival abilities of P. cinnamomi in vitro and has provided a useful tool for studying these abilities under more natural glasshouse conditions.  Important implications of phosphite as a control have been raised.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">saprophyte</field><field name="subject">chlamydospores</field><field name="subject">oospores</field><field name="subject">phosphite</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">dormancy</field><field name="subject">germination</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060807.92625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring Device for Early Warning Signs of Operator Fatigue in Open Cut Mines</field><field name="creator">NMabbott@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">An investigation into technologies to detect impaired performance due to driver fatigue was undertaken. From this, a new forced-choice stimulus-reaction device was developed specifically to detect driver impairment in operators of haul trucks in open cut mines. The device was developed in conjunction with personnel from the mining industry to suit the harsh conditions of the mining environment. The technology was trialled in three open cut mines and in a driving simulator at Murdoch University in Western Australia. Data were collected on the performance of drivers and analysed to validate the technology. A significant positive correlation was found between measures of reduced operator reaction performance and measures of eye closure. It was found that the device detected few false alarms and missed few bouts of tiredness as indicated by eye closures. It is suggested that the device would be a useful tool to assist with the detection of driver fatigue in open cut mining environments.  

The forced-choice reaction-monitoring device was used to assess the performance of drivers in a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The fly-in-fly-out haul truck drivers worked 14 consecutive 12-hour night shifts, had a day off, then worked 13 consecutive 12-hour day shifts. A total of more than 3,500 hours of real-time objective performance data were collected and analysed. The main findings were that the objective performance data showed patterns of low performance that did not fit some of the performance data that would be expected from examination of past literature. Many findings are discussed in light of these anomalies. Another important finding is that the subject&#146;s background and sleep pathology is a possible predictor for poor performance on the forced-choice reaction task. 

The system was also used to measure the performance of drivers with rising blood alcohol levels in a driving simulator. Subjects drank vodka with a mixer while driving for two hours starting at both 20:00 hrs and 22:00 hrs, with a week in between the two trials. The fatigue monitor detected reaction times slower than 3 SD of baseline performance at low levels of BAC. Performance at 22:00 hrs was marginally more impaired than performance at 20:00 hrs. Drivers at low BAC levels tended to compensate easier on the reaction task at 20:00 hrs compared to at 22:00 hrs. The ARRB fatigue monitor shows good capacity to detect poor performance due to low and medium measures of BAC. 

The research undertaken within this thesis has provided data that challenges contemporary research that generally suggests that time on task is one of the largest influences of fatigue at work. It appears that both circadian influences and individual lifestyle habits will have an equal or greater impact on fatigue risk at work.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fatigue management</field><field name="subject">human performance reaction time</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060809.93310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of Scleroderma spore inoculum for Eucalyptus nurseries in China</field><field name="creator">Yinglongchen@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Scleroderma, a genus of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, is often associated with
trees in disturbed habitats and is therefore considered to be suitable for use in
plantation forestry. This study investigated aspects of Scleroderma and its
mycorrhizas with the view to its future use in plantation forestry in south China.
Spores were chosen as inoculum as they are preferred by nursery managers in south
China, due to the lack of on-site fermentation and storage facilities.
To determine the need for inoculation, Eucalyptus plantations in south China
were sampled for sporocarps and mycorrhizas over two years. This study revealed a
low diversity of ECM fungi consisting of 15 taxa fruiting beneath Eucalyptus
plantations. The most common genera were Scleroderma and Pisolithus, but they
were infrequent and the extent of root colonization was poor. Bioassay trials with E.
urophylla as a bait host, using soils collected from 8 eucalypt plantations, confirmed
low levels of inoculum in field soil. It was concluded that introduction of suitable
ECM symbionts into eucalypt nurseries in south China is desirable in the future.
As the Scleroderma genus has not been well studied in Australasia or SE Asia,
over 140 collections gathered mainly from eucalypt plantations in south China and
south-western Australia were described using sporocarp and spore morphology.
Twelve Scleroderma taxa were recognized from collections made from under
eucalypt plantations in south-western Australia and 6 of these were collected from
under eucalypt plantations in south China. In conjunction with classical taxonomy,
30 collections, including those used in inoculation trials, were further characterized
by phylogenetic analyses of ITS or LSU rDNA sequences. These studies supported classical delineation of some Scleroderma species but not all. Although a limited
number of collections were amplified, phylogenetic results showed that most
collections in this study were distinct from the European and Malaysian taxa
extracted from GenBank (89% bootstrap support for both LSU and ITS regions).
In order to optimise spore germination and root colonization, two glasshouse
trials were established to examine suitable spore density and spore storage conditions
on E. globulus and E. urophylla. A spore density of 105 spores seedling-1 was
identified as a suitable dose for promoting root colonization. Spores stored for 5
years at low temperate (4 0C) were almost as effective as freshly collected spores in
forming mycorrhizas.
As the compatibility of Scleroderma fungi with plantation trees is unknown, a
glasshouse experiment examined the ability of 15 collections of Scleroderma to form
mycorrhizas with seedlings of six plantation trees (Acacia mangium, A. mearnsii, E.
globulus, E. urophylla, Pinus elliottii and P. radiata) in a nursery potting mix. Most
collections were able to aggressively colonize eucalypts and pines, while roots of
acacias were poorly colonized. As the Australian collections were more effective in
colonizing short roots on eucalypts than the Chinese collections, it was concluded
Scleroderma should be sourced from outside China for inoculating eucalypts in
Chinese nurseries.
To optimize nursery practices to meet the demand for high quality seedlings and
clonal lines of E. urophylla and hybrids, for outplanting in south China, effects of
rooting medium and inoculation with 6 Scleroderma collections on the growth of E.
urophylla were examined in a nursery in south China. Four types of soil taken from
eucalypt plantations in south China were compared to a potting mix composed of
vermiculite, peat and sand. The inoculant Scleroderma fungi were able to out-compete indigenous mycorrhizal fungi in the rooting media. However, the
potting mix was superior to soils both for plant growth and ECM development under
nursery conditions.
This research should facilitate the use of Scleroderma spores in eucalypt
nurseries in south China. Spore orchards could be set up in China using Australian
Scleroderma spp. from under eucalypts. Spores could be stored dry at 4 0C until they
are required for inoculation in potting mixes in containerized nurseries. However,
before commercial application, further work on persistence of Scleroderma in the
nursery and field, and responses of trees in the field to inoculation, needs to be
undertaken.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scleroderma spore</field><field name="subject">eucalyptus</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060809.93928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Was it worthwhile? : an historical analysis of five women missionaries and their encounters with the Nyungar people of south-west Australia</field><field name="creator">Longw@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Was it worthwhile? The thesis asks this question of the life and work of female faith missionaries who served in Western Australia with the Australian Aborigines&#146; Mission and/or the United Aborigines&#146; Mission, during the twentieth century. 
In 1902, the New South Wales Aborigines&#146; Mission adopted faith mission principles based on those of the China Inland Mission founded in 1865. The mission expanded into Western Australia in 1908 and changed its name to the Australian Aborigines&#146; Mission. From 1929, it was known as the United Aborigines&#146; Mission. The research began with a historiography of the China Inland Mission and the United Aborigines&#146; Mission and its antecedents. The analysis of the principles of these two missions identified that some characteristics of a faith mission were present in the New South Wales Aborigines&#146; Mission from the beginning and others were never adopted. It established that from 1902, the New South Wales Aborigines&#146; Mission upheld the faith principles of trusting God to provide physical needs, not soliciting for funds and not entering into debt. Because most faith missionaries were female, the historiography proceeded to examine texts on women missionaries, including recent work by Australian writers. This recognised that issues of gender, race and class were present within both mission cultures.
Five case studies were chosen to cover a period from 1912 when Bertha Telfer arrived in Western Australia until the retirement of Mary Jones in 1971. Using written and oral source material from Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives, the research studied the work of five female faith missionaries in south-west Australia: Bertha Telfer/Alcorn, Ethel Hamer/Fryer, Hope Malcolm/Wright, Mary Jones and Melvina Langley/Rowley, with a focus on issues of Evangelicalism, race, gender and class. Preliminary investigation of the women recognized that while only one had professional training and two received missionary training, membership of the interdenominational Christian Endeavour youth movement was a formative influence on all these female missionaries. An investigation into the principles of that organisation, founded in North America in 1881, established it was influenced by the 1858-59 Revival within Evangelicalism in England and North America and it placed a strong emphasis on personal conversion and a commitment to mission. Christian Endeavour spread to Australia by 1883 and was found to have provided limited leadership opportunities to women. 
The research tracked the experience of the female faith missionaries over six decades of living by faith among the Nyungar people and discovered a lack of identification with Indigenous culture that had its roots in a widely held belief in the superiority of western culture. Associated with this was the Evangelical belief in personal conversion that did not address cross-cultural issues. The UAM identification with the rise of fundamentalism from the 1920s coincided with diminished leadership opportunities for women at a time when women were gaining more choices in the wider Australian community. 
The thesis concludes that the role of faith missionary was costly to women in terms of their health and wellbeing. In the context of oppressive government policies towards Indigenous Australians, the poverty and marginalisation experienced by the women, when combined with compassion, created solidarity with Nyungar people. In some cases, this reduced the barriers of race and gender and resulted in the conversion of some Nyungar people, contributing to the formation of an Indigenous and Evangelical church. These findings are significant because they point to new understanding of mission, conversion and Aboriginal-missionary relations and cultures and of the role played by female faith missionaries in the shared mission history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Western Australians.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women missionaries</field><field name="subject">nyungar people</field><field name="subject">faith mission</field><field name="subject">United Aborigines Mission</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060809.94516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the forests of south western Australia in relation to climate and landforms.</field><field name="creator">Jaroslav J Havel</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to test the hypothesis that the vegetational patterns in the forested region of south western Australia are primarily determined by the interaction of climate and landform.
The region is an area of 4.25 million hectares subject to recent agreement between the Commonwealth of '4ustralia and the state of Western Australia regarding long-term
protection and management of forest (Regional Forest Agreement).
The climate of the South Western forest region is warm temperate and summer dry, matching Koeppen's category Cs, usually described as mediterranean.
The dominant geological features of South Western Australia are crystalline and sedimentary plateaus and coastal plains. They are subject to a complex process of
weathering, denudation and re-deposition, which is the key determinant of landforms and soil patterns. Deep but infertile soils are prevalent.
The dominant vegetation formation of the region is open forest, which reduces to woodland in the drier north and east and increases to tall open forest in the moister
south. Floristically the vegetation is very rich, comprising over 3000 vascular plant species. The richness resides in the forest and woodland understorey and in the
shrublands, heathlands and sedgelands of edaphically extreme sites. By comparison, the forest overstorey is very simple, only one or two species being often dominant
over extensive areas.

The validation of the hypothesis that climate and landforms determine the vegetation patterns in South Western Australia is carried out in the following stages:
1) review of past studies of vegetation patterns in relation to the underlying environmental factors, relating them to one another in terms of floristics,
2) conversion of landform and climate maps for the region into vegetation maps by means of toposequences, that is gradients of topography, soils and vegetation within individual landform/climate combinations,
3) production of two sets of vegetation maps, namely six maps of vegetation complexes (1:250,000) and one map of vegetation systems (1:500,000),
4) testing the predictive capability of the resulting maps by comparing the occurrences of individual species of trees, shrubs and herbs predicted by map
legends, with their records in FloraBase, the geographic information system of the Western Australian Herbarium, and
5) using the outcomes of the above studies to assess the validity of the hypothesis.

Because the above hypothesis is so broad, it will be considered under seven headings:
a) nature of the vegetation patterns (continuum or discrete categories),
b) regional effect of climate and local effect of landform,
c) effect of landforms on soil depth, texture and fertility,
d) joint effect of slope, soil depth and texture on water balance,
e) interactive effect of landform and climate on vegetation patterns,
f) response of individual species to climate and landform, and
g) effect of other factors of environment, such as fire, on vegetation patterns.

The subsidiary hypotheses are defined in Chapter 5.
It is concluded that the vegetation of the region forms a lumpy continuum from the wet south west to the dry north east. Within that broad continuum there are localised
continua from waterlogged sites in depressions to drought-prone sites on steep stony slopes. However, the dominant vegetation of the region is open forest on plateau
uplands with deep infertile soils.
Although climate and landforms have a strong effect on vegetation patterns, they do not determine all vegetation patterns directly. Some tree species have ranges of
occurrence that are too broad for that, and others have ranges that are too restricted.
A more probable explanation is that climate and landforms, together with fire, set the stage on which the interplay of species takes place and determines the structure and
composition of the vegetation. An attempt is made to predict the likely effect of climatic changes on vegetation patterns.
The applicability of the methodology developed to the mapping of other regions, especially the adjacent ones, is examined. A review is made of how the products of
the study, in particular the maps, are currently being used, and suggestions are made how they could be used in the future.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest microclimatology</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">South-West</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060815.114944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the molecular function of the nuclear oncoprotein HOX11 in human t-cell leukaemia.</field><field name="creator">Mansour Heidari</field><field name="description">HOXll, the prototypical member of the HOXll family (HOX11, HOXllLl and HOXllL2) was originally discovered as a transcriptional regulator aberrantly expressed in tumours with an immature T-cell phenotype (T-ALL) as a result of
specific chromosomal translocations involving T-cell receptor loci. Subsequently, it was revealed that HOXll is required for normal spleen development since newborn
Hoxll-/- mice exhibit asplenia. In both its normal and abnormal roles, HOXll has been postulated to function by binding regulatory elements within specific target genes
to control gene transcription. However, very few genomic targets of HOX11 have been identified and little is known about its mode of action. In this study, we sought to
further understand the role of HOX11 in controlling differentiation and cell growth by 1) determining the identity of genomic sequences that are directly bound by HOXll and 2) determining the identity of proteins which exist within HOXll-containing nuclear complexes.

To identify direct HOXll target sequences, a whole genome PCR-based screening method was employed using immobilised recombinant HOXll that had first been expressed as a biologically active GST fusion protein. Using this approach, restriction enzyme-cleaved human genomic DNA was selected for high-affinity HOXll binding sites. Unexpectedly, almost all clones isolated contained sequences derived from satellite 2 DNA that, together with related satellite 3 DNA, is found on most chromosomes at transcriptionally inactive pericentromeric heterochromatin. The specific binding of HOXl1 to satellite 2 DNA was verified by bandshift assays using
both recombinant HOXll protein and nuclear extract derived from the T-ALL cell line, ALL-SIL. DNA-protein complexes containing HOX11 were identified by their ablation upon addition of HOXl1 antibody.

To confirm that HOXll associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin in vivo, HOXll was characterised in terms of its nuclear localisation during interphase in
unsynchronised leukaemic T-cells (ALL-SIL) harbouring a translocation involving the HOXll locus. Using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, HOXll
antibody produced a punctate pattern of staining in the nucleus with discrete areas of dense staining superimposed on a diffuse distribution of HOXll protein. By dual staining, the bright HOXll foci correlated with centromeres since they overlapped with signals detected by an antibody specific for the centromeric protein CENP-B. Further evidence for a direct interaction of HOXll with satellite 2 DNA was provided by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In the presence of HOXll antibody, DNA fragments containing satellite 2 sequences were irnmunoprecipitated from sheared, cross-linked ALL-SIL chromatin but not from chromatin isolated from the HOXll-negative T-cell line PER-1 17. Finally, using a combination of immunoprecipitation with HOXll antibody, gel electrophoresis and mass peptide fingerprinting, a set of nuclear proteins were identified as potential HOXll interactors which are known to either localise to centromeric regions or act as regulators of gene expression. Together, these results implicate HOXl 1 in a functional interaction with centromeric heterochromatin,
which may be a key feature of this oncoprotein in terms of both its T-cell transformation and transcriptional regulatory functions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeobox genes</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic</field><field name="subject">Leukemia</field><field name="subject">HOX11</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060815.123509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An electrochemical study of reactions of nickel matte in acid media.</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth M Ho</field><field name="description">Nickel matte is a nickel &amp;de concentrate produced by smelting. It consists mainly of two components: a nickel-copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni3S2); but also contains
varying amounts of djurleite,Cu 1.96 S.There are several hydrometallurgical routes for processing nickel matte. The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid
chloride or sulfate solution. Nickel is subsequently recovered fiom the leach solution by electrowinning or by hydrogen reduction. In the work described in this thesis,
various aspects of the acid leaching of nickel matte are investigated using mostly
electrochemical methods.

The first section concerns the use of copper(II) as an oxidant for the alloy component of nickel matte. In this cementation reaction, nickel goes into solution while copper is deposited on the dissolving metal swf8ce. The same reaction is important in removing traces of copper present in the nickel solution. Here nickel powder is added to the process liquor. A survey of the literature pertaining to the cementation of copper by nickel shows that there is considerable dispute as to the conditions under which cementation takes place. Evans' diagrams for the cementation reaction were constructed by superimposing the polarisation curves for the oxidation of nickel and
the reduction of copper. It was found that cementation occurred provided that the two polarisation curves intersected in the region of active nickel dissolution. Outside this region, a copper deposit could not be seen.

The second part of the thesis presents some investigations into the electrochemistry of nickel sulfides and nickel matte, and compares both chloride and sulfate media.
Oxidation and dissolution rates of nickel matte powders using copper(I1) as an oxidant were also carried out. Dissolution was chemically controlled and so the rate was very dependent upon temperature and solution potential. Displacement of copper(II) from solution to form copper sulfide was also found to be important.

In addition to the above studies, which relate directly to the oxidative leaching ofnickel matte, an investigation of the oxidation of HzS to sulfUr in acidic solution was
carried out. S u k deposition was found to be strongly dependent on substrate and pH. Under some conditions, two types of sulfUr were deposited, with the more crystalline s u k being reduced at the more negative potential.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Ores</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060815.140539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of bauxite refining residue to reduce the mobility of heavy metals in municipal waste compost.</field><field name="creator">harriehofstede@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Use of bauxite refining residue to reduce the mobility of heavy metals in municipal waste compost.

Due to the adverse environmental impact of landfills and the lack of space for nearby population centres an unprecedented interest has developed in waste recycling with the objective to reduce the volume of waste disposed. Generally organic matter represents the largest fraction in the domestic waste stream including food, garden and paper waste.

In the past efforts have been made to process this organic fraction into muniapal compost.However contamination of the compost with heavy metals has in many cases resulted in the lack of suitable markets and subsequent closure of compost facilities. A study was undertaken and aimed at reducing the concentration and mobility of heavy metals in
municipal compost.

Bauxite refining residue ha; a high capacity to immobilise metals in soils through
precipitation, cation exchange and chemisorption (Fe- and Al- oxides).

The first step in the study was to assess the metal adsorption capacity of red mud by equilibrating red mud with metal solutions. Metal removal from solution proved very high.

Subsequently, the effect of red mud addition to municipal compost was studied in relation to metal mobility. In particular the interaction of metals with the mobile soluble organic fraction, the humic and fulvic acids, was investigated. It was found that most metals remained in the insoluble humin fraction and the metals in solution remained complexed to the soluble organic fraction. Red mud appeared to be able to adsorp fulvic and humic acids
and thus indirectly immobilise the metals in solution. Red mud did not appear to be able to transfer metals from the organic fraction to the mineral red mud fraction.

ft was kypothesised that, in order for the metals to be adsorped to red mud, the red mud needed to be present in the organic waste prior to composting. Metal adsorption to red mud is a rapid chemical reaction while metal complexation to the organic fraction takes a number of weeks, since it must be sufficiently oxidised to contain functional groups.

In order to verify this hypothesis, an installation with seven incubators was developed which allowed composting to be undertaken under computer controlled conditions and
monitored for temperature, airflow and carbon dioxide respiration. The incubators were filled with 10 kg of a mixture of grass clippings and sawdust. The first incubator functioned as a control. The contents of the rest of the incubators were spiked with the following
metals: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. In addition the contents of the 3rd - 7th incubators were amended with an increasing percentage of red mud, respectively 10,20,25,30 and 40 % by weight. After the mixture was composted, the metal mobility was reduced by approx. 80 - 99 %, depending on the metal. The mobility was assessed as leachable and plant available in relation to the total metal content. Red mud did not affect the composting process if &lt; 40% red mud was added.

The next step was to compost municipal organic waste in a pilot plant (capacity 5 m3) using batches with and without red mud. Mixed waste was collected from 150 households and
the glass, metal and plastic fractions were removed bx- manual sorting. The rest was composted.

The red mud - compost had a relatively lower metal content and a reduced metal mobility compared to compost without red mud. The red mud - compost also had a 300 times higher
pH buffer capacity and 90%less soluble organic matter.

The addition of red mud prior to composting was found to reduce the concentration and mobility of metals in compost, improve the quality of compost as a soil conditioner, increased the resistance of the organic fraction against further breakdown and this process
thus adds value to both red mud and organic waste.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Waste disposal</field><field name="subject">Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Aluminum plants</field><field name="subject">Compost</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060815.143422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bio-sociological relationship between Western Australian Aboriginals and their dogs.</field><field name="creator">Margaret L Howe</field><field name="description">The hypothesis central to this study is that distinctly Aboriginal patterns of relationship between humans and dogs are still evident in contemporary Aboriginal groups. The relationship's sociological characteristics in traditional and contemporary settings and its implications for canine and human health are also investigated.
Field research employing survey, quantitative observation and specimen analysis techniques was conducted in 9 Western Australian Aboriginal groups of various
backgrounds and settings. Results were compared to historic-traditional accounts and dog ownership studies in non-Aboriginal groups.
Traditionally dogs served Aboriginals most importantly for supernatural protection and to assist the collection of small game by women. In non-isolated groups, traditional
utilitarian motives were superseded by the Western concept of dogs as companions.
Demographically, the Aboriginal dog populations surveyed were relatively large, and most dogs were classified as medium sized non-descript cross-breds.
Dogs were more commonly owned by adult and aged individuals, rather than by family units as is the Western cultural norm. Most dogs remained with their original owner
and retained their original name for life.
Traditional values of respect towards dogs were compromised to the discriminatory care of higher status animals only, effecting selection pressure against undesirable dogs, particularly females. Similarly, while many aged people were opposed to culling, most respondents regarded community pup production as excessive and accepted culling as necessary. Nevertheless prevention was the preferred option, with strong support for the previously unfamiliar concept of ovariohysterectomy.
Pups were raised in some respects like children in the traditional manner, indulgence giving way in adulthood to expectations of self-reliance rather than obedience.
Most dogs were in good physical and psychological condition, though more likely to be afflicted by sarcoptic mange than other Australian dogs. Other parasites occurred
at or below expected frequencies.
Close physical contact with dogs coupled with favourable microclimates allowed ample opportunity for transmission of canine zoonoses, but the actual risk to human health
remains poorly documented.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060815.151043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precipitation and characteristics of iron (III) oxyhydroxides from acid liquors.</field><field name="creator">Evan J Jamieson</field><field name="description">An important problem in the mineral processing industry is the removal of iron (III) from process and waste streams by precipitation as the metal hydroxide by elevation of pH. Caustic (NaOH),lime(CaO) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2,), are cheap and effective reagents for this purpose, however iron (III) oxyhydroxides often form polymeric chains when precipitated at ambient temperature. This gelatinous material is slow to settle and difficult to filter, unlike the crystalline solids obtained at higher temperature.

A systematic hdamental study was undertaken to assess the suitability of various characterisation techniques to the iron oxide and oxyhydroxide group of minerals. Techniques
such as chemical dissolution methods, surface area, TEM and thermal gravimetry were found to be very useful for comparative purposes, but were not recommended as primary
characterisation techniques. Mossbauer spectroscopy proved to be the most reliable method for deteimination of phase composition especially when used in conjunction with XRD.
However cost and time for analysis prevent this technique being used extensively. It was found that XRD, settling rate and settled sediment volume were broadly applicable and able to identify variation between samples cheaply and efficiently.

This study also methodically compared the settling rates, sediment volumes and iron oxide phases associated with using caustic solution, dry &amp; slaked lime and dry &amp; slaked magnesia.

Pure sodium hydroxide and iron (III) chloride solutions were used to represent the simplest system Factors such as temperature, mixing, neutralisation rate, heterogeneous precipitation  sulphate addition, the presence of divalent cations (Mg2') and strong iron (III) ligands (eg citrate, oxalate) were investigated with this system Generally the predominant iron phase precipitated was the poor order 0 or 2 XRD .line ferrihydrite. The temperature during
precipitation was found to be the only critical parameter in changing product crystallinity and morphology. However, some other factors were able to produce small changes in
agglomeration and settling rates, suggesting processes such as pulp recycle may prove beneficial. The iron (III) sulphate system induced a change in precipitates producing
microcrystalline goethite, although settling rates were not improved.

The use of slowly dissolving lime in the iron (III chloride system was unable to improve precipitate crystallinity or settling rate, however results suggest that lime and caustic can be used interchangeably. The lime / iron (III) sulphate system produced a co precipitate of ferrihydrite and gypsum of enhanced settling ability relative to the caustic system.

The use of sparingly soluble magnesia failed to improve the precipitate of the iron (m) chloride system, however substantial improvement was found in the crystallinity and settling rate when using the iron (III) sulphate and mixed chloride / sulphate system, provided a range of conditions were met. This product resembled "dense amorphous basic ferric sulphate" (DABFS) and was identified as a highly ordered form of ferrihydrite by Mossbauer studies. It
is suggested that this precipitate may form the basis for a new low temperature industrial precipitation process.

To further investigate the iron precipitation process, iron (II) and mixed iron (II)/(III) chloride
solutions were hydrolysed with the addition of sodium hydroxide, calcium oxide and magnesium oxide under well aerated conditions. Dense maghemite was produced with the
caustic system at ambient temperature which settled faster than magnetite precipitated at 70&#176;C. The divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+ appear to hinder precipitation of crystalline
maghemite at ambient temperature, forming the gelatinous poorly ordered ferrihydrite.

This fundamental and systematic study of the precipitation process of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides has led to an improvement in the integral understanding of iron (III)
hydrolysis. The investigation of characterisation techniques has also led to an enhanced knowledge of their interaction with these precipitates and hence their strengths and weaknesses.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060816.130615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical studies on the cementation of copper and cobalt with zinc.</field><field name="creator">Xiong Jiang</field><field name="description">The work described i n this thesis deals mainly with a fundamental study of two cementation reactions, i.e., Cu(II)/Zn and Co(II)/Zn, using the electrochemical techniques of linear potential sweep voltammetry, cyclic vol tammetry, chronopotentiometry (stripping), capacitance measurements,ring current measurements and impedance spectroscopy. In addition, solution analysis, x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were
employed to achieve a better understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of the two cementations. The half reactions of the two systems were also investigated as an essential part of the whole study. Of the two systems investigated, the Cu(II)/Zn system, was mainly used as a reference system
on which some of the new techniques could be proved.

The Cu(II)/Zn reaction has been shown to be diffusion controlled. Five methods, including solution analysis, have been used to determine the rate of reaction. The values of the rate constants thus determined were in good agreement provided allowance was made for the nonstoichiometry of this reaction due to proton displacement by zinc.

The Co(II)/Zn cementation reaction, though thermodynamically highly
favourable, is kinetically very sluggish. Of the factors affecting this reaction, the solution pH was found to play a substantial role. For example, while the reaction is largely under chemical control, at pH 5 the reaction rate becomes limited by the speed at which cobalt(I1) ions diffuse to the reacting metal surface. The favourable influence of a higher pH on the reduction of cobalt(II) carried out either electrochemically or chemically using zinc powder was ascribed to the increasing formation of the electrochemically active species, CoOH+ . Increasing the temperature also favours the shift from chemical control to diffusion control.

Values for the rate constants of the Co(II)/Zn reaction in the absence of added zn2+ ions were determined from Evans' diagram, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy, The reasons for the differences in the values of rate thus obtained were discussed.

The presence of zinc ions in the reaction solution greatly suppressed the rate of Co(II)/Zn cementation reaction. Several factors have been identified as contributing to the reduced reaction rate. These are the double layer effect, zinc ion and hydrogen atom adsorption, and precipitation of basic zinc salts which blanket the reacting metal surface.

The action of compounds such as Sb(III) and As(III), which are commonly used to activate the Co(II)/Zn reaction in the presence of large amounts of zn2+, was investigated mainly by impedance spectroscopy. From the similarity of the impedance spectra for the reaction i n the presence of
benzoqui none, it was inferred that one role of the activators was to suppress the formation of adsorbed hydrogen on the reacting surface and to allow a higher concentration of the active species, COOH'.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">Cementation</field><field name="subject">Zinc</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Cobalt</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060816.135721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemistry of the leaching of chalcopyrite</field><field name="creator">Mar&#237;a Isabel L&#225;zaro-B&#225;ez</field><field name="description">The potential region in which chalcopyrite dissolves during

leaching of pre-reduced nickel laterites in ammonia-ammonium carbonate solution.
Although the process has undergone various improvements since it was first introduced,
the total recoveries are still relatively low, averaging at 80% for nickel and 45-50% for
cobalt. The lack of sound fundamental information regarding the mechanisms and the
kinetics of the dissolution of nickel and cobalt from iron-alloy grains produced by the
reduction roasting of lateritic ores is seen as the main obstacle to establishing the
reasons for the lack of adequate recovery and to defining alternative processing
strategies which would lead to improved extraction and better process optimisation.
Based on fimdamental electrochemical studies and bench scale leaching tests, as well as
on-site measurements at an industrial plant where this process is applied, the work
presented in the thesis introduces significant new evidence and sheds more light on the
understanding of the mechanism of the dissolution process and on the reasons for the
low extractions of nickel and cobalt.
It has been established that the oxidative dissolution of the iron-alloy grains formed
during the reduction roasting takes place primarily via a reaction involving reduction of
dissolved cobalt (111) to cobalt (11), and also that the reduction of water is not a
significant component of the reactions involved in the dissolution process. Open-circuit
potential measurements with various metals and iron-alloys selected to model the reduced material in various solutions which simulated the leaching conditions were also
conducted and revealed that passivation takes place during the leaching process. This
brings to light a possible new reason for the low recoveries of nickel and cobalt which
has not been previously considered. In addition, a kinetic study was conducted, in which
the dissolution rates for the various metals, iron-alloys and solutions were measured as a
function of time, and the results of which shed more light on the development of the
process of passivation.
The passivation itself is attributed to formation of iron-oxide on the surface of the
dissolving iron-alloy grains, which restricts the transfer of electrons to the reduced
metal and brings the oxidative leaching reaction to an end. It has been shown that the
passivation can occur in two ways.
On the one hand, particularly high concentration of dispersed and dissolved oxygen in
the leaching reactors causes passivation by overcoming the limiting current density for
the oxidation of iron to divalent iron ions and taking the potential to the region where
the direct oxidation to trivalent ions becomes favourable resulting in the formation of an
iron-oxide film on the surface.
On the other hand, in normally aerated solutions, the passivation of the dissolving ironalloy
grains occurs due to the formation of a cobalt and nickel sulphide layer, as a byproduct
of the reduction of thiosulphate on the metal surface, which in turn gradually
shrinks the area available for the oxidation of iron, again leading to a situation where
the oxidising agents present in the solution under standard aerated conditions become
sufficient to shift the mixed potential to the region where the iron-oxide forming
reaction becomes favourable.
The presence of thiosulphate has a decisive role in the second type of passivation. What
is more, besides preventing further dissolution of the nickel and cobalt locked in the
iron-alloy matrix, the loss of nickel and cobalt by precipitation in the presence of
thiosulphate can further reduce the recovery of these metals. For this reason, a method
was developed for the oxidation and removal of thiosulphate fkom the actual plant
liquor.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leaching</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Nickel</field><field name="subject">Electrometallurgy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060818.132232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of four commercial fish species in a seasonally closed estuary</field><field name="creator">Pia Orr</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to determine the size and age compositions, growth
rates, reproductive biology, dietary compositions and mesh selectivity of the King
George whiting Sillaginodes punctata, the Australian herring Arripis georgiana, the
yelloweye mullet Aldrichetta forsteri and the sea mullet Mugil cephalus in Wilson Inlet.
These biological variables were chosen for analysis since the resultant data would be of
use for managing these commercially important marine species in this seasonally closed
estuary, which is located on the southern coast of Western Australia.
Samples of each of the above species were typically collected, in at least every
other month between April 1988 and April 1990, by using seine netting and gill netting
at several sites, distributed at regular intervals throughout the 48 km2 basin of Wilson
Inlet, and by gill netting at one site in each of two tributary rivers. The ages of
Sillaginodes punctata, Aldrichetta forsteri and Mugil cephalus were determined using
the annuli on scales, whereas those of Arripis georgiana were determined using the
annuli on otoliths. The annuli on the above hard structures of the four species were
shown to be formed annually before they were used for aging purposes.
Although at least four year classes of each species were found in Wilson Inlet,
the 0+ year class of none of the species was well represented in this estuary. The
paucity of this age class was probably attributable, in most cases, to the spawning
grounds of these species being located some distance away on the lower west coast of
Australia. However, the absence of any 0+ S. punctata in one year was attributed to the
mouth of Wilson Inlet being closed at a crucial time, which thereby prevented the
recruitment of this species into this estuary.

Virtually all of the S. punctata caught in Wilson Inlet were less than the LSo at
first maturity, which implies that none of this species return to this estuary after they
have emigrated to sea, matured and spawned. However, appreciable numbers of each of
the other three species were found at lengths greater than their respective Lsos. There
was clear evidence that large A. forsteri tended to leave the estuary soon after the bar at
the estuary mouth was breached. In contrast, length-frequency distributions indicated
that large A. georgiana often tended to remain in the estuary, even when they exceeded
the LSo at first maturity and the estuary mouth was open. The maximum lengths
attained by S. punctata, A. georgiana, A. forsteri and M. cephalus were 491,373,430
and 525 mm, respectively, while the maximum ages attained by these four species were
5+, 7+, 5+ and 4+, respectively. While there was no significant difference between the
growth rates of the two sexes of either S. punctata or M. cephalus, the overall growth
rates of the females of A. georgiana and A. forsteri were both greater than those of their
males.
Each fish was assigned a maturity stage using the criteria of Laevastu (1965).
The maximum maturity stage recorded for the gonads of S. punctata was IV (maturing).
The fact that no S. punctata with spawning (stage VI), spent (stage VII), recovering
spent (stage VIII) or resorbing gonads were found provides overwhelming evidence that
this whiting species neither spawns in Wilson Inlet nor returns to this estuary after it has
spawned at sea. Furthermore, spawning and recently-spent gonads were never found in
individuals of either A. georgiana, A. forsteri or M. cephalus, whch implies that these
species also do not spawn in the estuary. However, some A. georgiana and A. forsteri
with recovering spent gonads were found in Wilson Inlet, which indicates that some
individuals of these two species enter the estuary after spawning at sea. There was no
indication that this also applied with M. cephalus. Yet, the gonads of some individuals of this latter species and also of A. georgiana contained resorbing gonads, i. e gonads
that had reached a reasonably advanced stage, but not maturity, and which were now
undergoing regression. The fish with these gonads had presumably been trapped in the
estuary at the time their gonads were developing and could not therefore emigrate out to
their marine spawning areas.
The dietary compositions of the four species were shown to be significantly
different. Sillaginodes punctata and A. georgiana fed mainly on benthic
macroinvertebrates, while all but the smallest M. cephalus were detritivores and
A. forsteri was an omnivore. Furthermore, S. punctata fed mainly on errant polychaetes
and nemerteans, whereas A. georgiana ingested decapods, mysids and other teleosts.
The diets of each species underwent size-related changes. The differences in dietary
compositions among and within species would reduce the likelihood of inter- and
intraspecific competition for food resources.
Comparisons have been made between traditional methods for estimating the
selectivity of S. punctata, A. georgiana, A. forsteri and M. cephalus in gill nets and a
new method of analysis developed (with Dr. N. Hall), which incorporates the best
features of the traditional methods.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Wilson Inlet</field><field name="subject">Habitat</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060818.133418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Santalum album L. plantations : a complex interaction between parasite and host</field><field name="creator">Andrew M Radomiljac</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a broad spectrum of physiological and silvicultural features of the highly
valued woody angiosperm hemi-parasite Santalurn album L. (Indian sandalwood) in relation to
its culture in plantations in northern Western Australia. Topics covered include allometry of
host and Santalum when grown as single plant pairings in both field and pot culture, nutritional
interactions between Santalum and beneficial and non-beneficial hosts, deleterious influences
of parasitism on plantation productivity and heartwood induction in young trees.

In Western Australia sandalwood is grown in the nursery for 8 months before establishment in
the field and during this time a pot host is introduced. Survival of Santalurn after field
establishment and its subsequent growth were significantly affected by the time of introduction
of the pot host, Alternanthera nana. Increasing the period of the Santalum : Alternanthera
association in the nursery to 109 days prior to field establishment markedly increased early
growth of Salztalum plantations. Introduction at 134 days prior to field establishment was
detrimental to the parasite as the Alternanthera was too vigorous for the small Santalum
seedlings. Santalurn plants had a lower root : shoot ratio lower when cultured with
Alternanthera in the nursery prior to field establishment compared with seedlings grown
without Alternanthera. Alterrzantlzera survival in the field was high when it had been grown
with Santalum for 12 weeks or more in the nursery prior to field establishment. After 1 1 weeks
in the field a strong negative linear relationship was shown between Santalunz root : shoot ratio
and Alternarzthera dry weight, and a positive linear relationship between Salztalum DW and
Alternanthera DW.

In Western Australia Santalu~n is established in the field with an intermediate host which
nourishes the parasite for 3-5 years before Santalum becomes dependent on its long-term host
and the intermediate host dies. The relationship between Santalum and several species tested as
intermediate hosts was examined by pairing Santalum seedlings with intermediate host
seedlings in 25 litre pots over a 10 month period. Growth of Santalum in pot culture with three
N2-fixing woody intermediate hosts (Sesbania forrnosa, Acacia traclzycarpa and A. ampliceps),
the woody non N2-fixing Eucalyptus camaldulensis or without a host varied considerably
between host treatments. Santalum growth was greater and root : shoot ratio lower for
seedlings grown with N2-fixing hosts compared with seedlings grown with E. carnaldulensis or
with no host. The root : shoot ratio of unattached Santalum increased exponentially over time,
whereas for all other treatments it remained relatively constant. An assessment of the value of
the hosts, termed host use efficiency, was computed as Santalum shoot DW / host shoot DW.
The host use efficiency of A. trachycalpa was greater than that of the other hosts.

The xylem sap of hosts and Sarztalum, and ethanolic extracts of endophytic tissue of haustoria
of Santalzkm were analysed for amino acids, organic acids and sugars to determine which
solutes were available in the host and which were extracted by the Santalum haustoria from
different hosts. There were similarities between Santalum and legume hosts in concentration
and composition of xylem sap amino acids, and in the amino acid spectra of the corresponding
Santalum endophytic tissue, whereas there were low N levels in xylem sap of E. camaldulensis
and dissimilarities between its amino acid composition and that of Santalum. This indicated
substantial direct intake of xylem N by Santalum from legume hosts but little N from the xylem
sap of E. canzaldulensis. There were high concentrations of asparagine, glutamate, aspartate
and y-amino glutamate in the xylem sap of the legume hosts, while in the non-legume the most
common amino acids were glutamate, aspartate, glutamine and arginine. Proline, the
predominant amino acid in the xylem sap of Santalum acurninatum growing in natural
vegetation (Tennakoon et al. 1997) was not detected or present in very low concentrations in
Santalurn album under these conditions. in the non-legume. Xylem sap of hosts contained
variable amounts of sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) and organic acids (fumaric, citric
and malic acid), whereas that of the parasitic Santalum was dominated by fructose and malic
acid. Dissimilarities in the proportional amounts of xylem-borne sugars and organic acids were
particularly evident for the E. camaldulensis : Santalum partnership.

Diurnal profiles of photosynthesis and transpiration of Santalum were closely similar to those
for corresponding hosts, whereas the midday leaf water potential of Santalum was consistently
more negative than that of corresponding hosts. Net photosynthesis and water use efficiency
was lower, but transpiration rates were similar to that of corresponding hosts. Nitrogen
concentrations of foliage of Santalum were higher than their hosts, and higher when on legume
hosts than on E. camaldulensis, or without a host. Nitrogen concentrations of Santalum foliage
was strongly correlated with net photosynthesis and water use efficiency of Santalum. 813C
values of shoot dry matter of Santalum were poorly correlated with instantaneous water use
efficiency of Santalum. Tissue water relations of Santalum were similar to that of water-stress
tolerant species.

S. formosa proved the best host followed by Acacia ampliceps and A. traclzycarpa based on dry
matter gains of Santalum. Estimates of heterotrophic gain of C of Santalum when grown in
association with the legume hosts over a nine week period indicate 57.9% of C was derived from A. ampliceps, 45.5% from A. trachycarpa and 34.6% fiom S. fomosa. Abundance of
haustorial attachments on roots of hosts was poorly correlated to Santalum shoot DW. Root
nodules of legume hosts were parasitised by a small proportion of Santalum haustoria.

Sodium and phosphorus concentrations of foliage of Santalum were generally higher than that
of corresponding hosts. Net gains of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sodium in Santalum
was greatest when grown in association with hosts richest in the corresponding element. Net
losses or only small gains of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sodium were recorded when
Santalum was grown with E. camaldulensis or without a host suggesting that Santalum has
limited ability for uptake of those minerals through its own root system.

To understand the effect of hosts on the productivity of a Santalum plantation a young
plantation of Santalum with three host species Cathormion umbellatum, Sesbania formosa and
Acacia anuera was selected to study the relationship between host quality and distance of hosts
from Santalunz on Santalum health. The selected plantation showed marked decline in health
and vigour of both Santalum and hosts between years 3 and 5. Parameters of the host plants
were assessed to select the best predictor of Santalunz crown health. The height and diameter
growth increment of Santalum between years 3 and 5 was strongly correlated to Santalum
crown health. Santaluin crown health and growth increased as host quality increased, and the
distance of host fiom Santalum decreased. An index, which combined host quality and the
distance of the host from that of Santalum, was a better predictor of Santalum crown health
than host distance or quality alone.

The age at which heartwood is initiated in Santalum album under plantation conditions in
Western Australia in unknown, but in natural stands in India it occurs between 10-13 years of
age (Rai 1990). A field experiment was conducted to determine the efficacy of stem injections
of paraquat andlor ethrel in initiating heartwood formation in five year old Santalum trees in a
plantation. Trees injected with paraquat alone had a significantly greater extension of induced
heartwood, both radially and vertically, than those trees injected with ethrel alone or distilled
water. Eight months after treatment with paraquat or ethrel or a combination of these
chemicals induced heartwood was formed, which had high lipid, and low starch and
polysaccharide concentrations compared to the sapwood. Induced heartwood from both
chemical treatments and their combinations contained total volatile oil and santalol oil (alpha
and beta santalol) concentrations that were equal to or greater than that of naturally formed
heartwood and greater than that of sapwood. Moisture content, and concentrations of K and
Mg, and in some treatments Ca of induced heartwood were significantly lower than that of sapwood.
The thesis concludes with a synthesis of the findings and suggestions for future research, with
special reference to mid-rotation aspects of Santaltrm plantation silviculture.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sandalwood</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant-pathogen relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060818.134603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age compositions, growth rates, reproductive biology and diets of the black bream Acanthopagrus butcheri in four estuaries and a coastal saline lake in south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">G A Sarre</field><field name="description">The aims of the studies undertaken for this thesis on the black bream
Acanthopagrus butcheri, a species which is confined to estuaries, were to determine the
following. (1) The age compositions, growth rates, reproductive biology and diets of the
populations of this species in four different estuaries (Swan River, Moore River,
NomaluplWalpole and Wellstead estuaries) and a landlocked saline lake (Lake Clifton)
and (2) the seasonal and regional distributions of this species within one estuary (Swan
River Estuary). Acanthopagrus butcheri were collected at regular intervals from
nearshore, shallow (&lt; 2 m) and offshore, deeper (&gt; 2.5 m) waters of the permanently open
Swan River Estuary and intermittently open Moore River Estuary on the lower west coast
of Australia and from the permanently open Nomalup/Walpole Estuary and normally
closed Wellstead Estuary on the southern coast of Western Australia. One hundred
A. butcheri were also obtained from a landlocked, coastal saline lake (Lake Clifton), 90 km
south of the Swan River Estuary. Sampling employed seine nets, composite gill nets and
rod and line.

In the Swan River Estuary, black bream typically occur in the saline reaches of the
tributary rivers which constitute the upper estuary. However, during heavy freshwater
discharge in winter, many individuals are swept downstream into the basins that constitute
the middle estuary. These fish migrate back into the upper estuary in spring and the larger
fish spawn in this region between the middle of spring and early summer. Although
smaller fish tend to remain in the upper estuary during summer as salinities increase, the
larger fish migrate further upstream where salinities are lower. The salinities in which
A. butcheri spawned in the different systems ranged from as low as 5.5 - 6.8 %CJin the
Moore River Estuary to as high as 40.7 - 45.2 %O in the Wellstead Estuary.

The use of marginal increment analyses demonstrated that the opaque zones
revealed in otoliths by sectioning are formed annually and could thus be used for ageing
individual fish and that the opaque zones visible in whole otoliths prior to sectioning could
be used for ageing fish up to six years old. The number of annuli on scales did not
provide a reliable estimate of age. The structure of the age compositions in the four
estuaries varied, presumably reflecting differences in fishing pressure and, in one case, the
lack of recruitment in some years. The growth rates of A. butcheri in the four estuaries
and landlocked lake differed, which is probably related to variations in one or more of the
following; water temperature, density of fish, salinity and the type of food available.

The monthly trends exhibited by gonadosomatic indices and the prevalence of
different gonadal maturity stages and mature oocytes demonstrate that spawning typically
occurs in spring and early summer. The frequent occurrence of yolk vesicle, yolk granule
oocytes and post-ovulatory follicles in the ovaries of some mature fish provides strong
circumstantial evidence that A. butcheri is a multiple spawner, i.e. spawns more than once
during each breeding season. Estimates of the minimum total fecundity ranged between
9.07 x lo4 and 7.09 x lo6, with a mean of 1.58 x lo6. Variations amongst the lengths and
ages at first maturity in three of the estuarine populations of A. butcheri could apparently
be attributed to the influence of variations in growth rate.

Female and male Acanthopagrus butcheri both possess an ovotestis, a feature
characteristic of the Sparidae. There is strong circumstantial evidence that, once a member
of this species reaches maturity, it can be considered a rudimentary hermaphrodite, i.e. it
possesses either functional ovaries and far smaller and immature testes or functional testes
and immature ovaries of variable size. There was no evidence that this species undergoes
either a protogynous or protandrous sex change.

Acanthopagrus butcheri can consume various benthic and epibenthic prey,
including crustaceans, polychaetes, molluscs and teleosts, and can also ingest considerable
volumes of algae. However, the dietary compositions of A. butcheri in the four estuaries
and Lake Clifton differed markedly, whch, together with information on the biota in those
systems, indicate that A. butcheri feeds on those prey items that are most abundant in their
environment. Yet, there is also evidence that, in any given system, A. butcheri will focus on
a particular prey, even when other prey, which are regularly consumed in considerable
volume in other systems, are abundant. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri in each
estuary underwent ontogenetic changes, which would reduce the potential for intraspecific
competition for food resources.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acanthopagrus butcheri</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">South-West</field><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060818.135836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic corrosion inhibitors</field><field name="creator">Swee Hain Tan</field><field name="description">The overall aims of this thesis were to conduct a broad survey of possible organic
corrosion inhibitors in near-neutral chloride solutions and to elucidate the
mechanisms of such action.
Altogether, 130 organic compounds were studied as possible corrosion inhibitors for
pure iron, mild steel, copper and aluminium in aerated near-neutral (pH = 8.4)
solutions containing 500 ppm NaCl and 100 ppm NaHCO,, conditions often
encountered in water-based automotive engine coolants. Inhibitor behaviour was
investigated using steady-state electrochemical techniques including polarisation
curves, Stern-Geary and corrosion potential (Em,) measurements.
The organic compounds examined were found to be highly specific in their
inhibitive action toward the metals studied. Typical examples of highly effective
corrosion inhibitors were: sebacate and octanoate for pure iron; oleate and sebacate
for mild steel; benzotriazole and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole for copper; and laurate
and oleate for aluminium.
E, was found to provide a rapid and convenient screening test for evaluating the
inhibitor performance of organic compounds toward pure iron, mild steel and
aluminium but was less useful for copper.
Good organic inhibitors were found to act as anodic inhibitors toward pure iron and
mild steel but as anodic or mixed-type inhibitors toward copper. For aluminium,
the majority of the compounds studied were found to act as anodic inhibitors.
However,However, it was also found that only pit initiation was inhibited, i.e. existing pits
were not prevented from developing. Optical microscopy of pitted aluminium
surfaces indicated their nature varied considerably with inhibition efficiency.
The role of complex formation in organic corrosion inhibitors was found to vary
with the metal. Complexation of either iron(I1) or iron(II1) ions was found to have
an insignificant effect on mild steel. The corrosion rate of copper was found to
increase with the copper(LI) complex stability, thus indicating complex formation to
be the rate-determining step. For aluminium, the observed effects were found to
depend on complex stability. For weak to moderate complexants, inhibitor
efficiency (measured as E,,) increased with increasing complexation. However, very
strong complexing agents were sufficiently stable to dissolve the aluminium oxide
surface, leading to poor inhibition. Aluminium pit morphology was found, using
scanning electron microscopy, to change from hemispherical in the uninhibited
solution to irregular in the presence of complexing inhibitors.
No simple relationships between inhibitor efficiency and molecular structure were
found. However, carbon chain length, the nature of functional group(s) and their
location in the molecule were found to be important but varied according to the
metal.
The inhibiting ability of sebacate (a straight chain C, dicarboxylate) was found not
to be compromised by water movement (stirring) or pre-existing corrosion product
layers. Immersion tests showed that passive film formation on mild steel in
sebacate solution involved two stages and was complete only after -100 h
immersion.
The ion selective properties of several iron(II1) carboxylates and hydrated iron(II1)
oxide films were studied by membrane potential measurements in neutral sodium
chloride solutions. Some specimens were also studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy.
These results show that dicarboxylates are good inhibitors toward mild steel because
they form impermeable films. Poor inhibitor performance is associated with the
anion selectivity of the film which in turn appears to be related to the film purity.
A model is suggested for the inhibition mechanism of mild steel corrosion by
dicarboxylates in aerated near-neutral chloride solutions.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corrosion</field><field name="subject">Anti-corrosives</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds</field><field name="subject">Chloride</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060818.150145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emerging canine tick-borne diseases in Australia and phylogenetic studies of the canine Piroplasmida</field><field name="creator">ryanj@ichr.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Canine tick-borne diseases are an emerging problem within Australia and throughout the world. This thesis investigates Babesia gibsoni and Anaplasma platys infections in dogs in Australia and also explores the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of the canine piroplasm species and the members of the order Piroplasmida.

A nested PCR-RFLP assay was developed for the detection and differentiation of the canine piroplasm species and was found to have a high detection limit, capable of detecting a 2.7 x 10-7 % parasitaemia or the equivalent of 1.2 molecules of target DNA. Detection of piroplasm DNA applied to Whatman FTA&#147; classic cards using nested-PCR was found to have a lower detection limit than when using DNA extracted from whole blood but higher than IsoCode&#145; Stix or QIAamp extraction from filter paper based techniques. The nested PCR-RFLP assay was further evaluated for the detection of B. gibsoni infection in dogs being exported from Australia to New Zealand and compared to the current screening methods, the Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and microscopy. Of 235 dogs screened, 11 were IFAT positive, 1 was microscopy positive and 3 were PCR positive for B. gibsoni, highlighting the discordance that exists between various detection techniques. Replacing microscopic examination of blood smears with PCR-RFLP is suggested for screening dogs entering New Zealand, in addition to revising the current IFAT cut-off titre to minimize false positive results. The first case of B. gibsoni in New South Wales is also reported.

A study was also conducted to further investigate the recent discovery of B. gibsoni in Australia and the association of this infection with American Pit Bull Terriers in an epidemiological study. Both American Pit Bull Terriers (n = 100) and other dog breeds (n = 51) were screened for B. gibsoni using IFAT and PCR-RFLP. A questionnaire was also completed by each dog owner regarding thethe husbandry and habits these dogs. Fourteen dogs were positive for B. gibsoni using IFAT and/or PCR-RFLP and all were American Pit Bull Terriers. Dogs that were male and/or were bitten by or were biters of other American Pit Bull Terriers were statistically more likely to be B. gibsoni positive, thus suggesting that blood-to-blood transmission may contribute to the spread of this disease. 

Experimental B. gibsoni infections were established in vivo to investigate the efficacy of combined atovaquone and azithromycin therapy and to determine the detection limits of PCR, IFAT and microscopy during various stages of infection. While atovaquone and azithromycin produced a reduction in circulating parasite levels, it did not cause total eradication, and possible drug resistance also developed in one dog. PCR was found to be most useful in detecting early and acute stage infections, while IFAT was most useful during chronic and acute infections. Microscopy is suggested to be only useful for detecting acute stage infections. This study also describes the detection of B. gibsoni in tissue samples during chronic infection for the first time, suggesting possible sequestration of this parasite.

Anaplasma platys has also only recently been reported in Australia and the distribution, molecular-charcterisation, pathogenesis, co-infection with Babesia canis vogeli and treatment of infection with doxycycline were investigated. For the first time, A. platys is reported in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria, with each isolate found to be genetically identical on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene. No correlation could be established between A. platys infection and the development of clinical signs or pathogenesis and definitive treatment using doxycycline could not be determined.

Isolates of canine piroplasms from various geographical locations worldwide (n = 46), including Australia were characterised on the basis of multiple gene loci to explore the distribution, genetic variation and possible phylogeographical relationships of these species. Separate genotypes of B. canis vogeli, B. canis canis and B. gibsoni are suggested and may be correlated to different geographical origins. Characterization of B. canis vogeli, B. canis canis and B. canis rossi on the basis of the HSP 70 gene and B. gibsoni on the basis of the ITS 1, 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS 2 is described for the first time. Elevation of each of the B. canis subspecies, with the exclusion of B. canis presentii, to separate species is also proposed.

The current paraphyly and taxonomic confusion associated with the members of the order Piroplasmida led to a review of the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of this group of organisms. Phylogenetic relationships are determined using 18S rRNA gene, 5.8S rRNA gene, HSP 70 gene and combined loci analyses. Rearrangement of the Piroplasmida into three families, including the new family Piroplasmiidae is proposed, in addition to the establishment of two new genera, the Piroplasma (Patton, 1895) and the Achromaticus (Dionisi, 1899). Other proposed schemes of classification and the limitations of phenotypic characteristics in taxonomic classification within the Piroplasmida are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">canine</field><field name="subject">piroplasm</field><field name="subject">Babesia</field><field name="subject">Anaplasma</field><field name="subject">tick</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060825.112520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canine zoonoses in Aboriginal communities : the effects of a canine breeding program in the Kimberley Region, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Wilks</field><field name="description">The hypothesis central to this study is that the implementation of a canine breeding and parasite
control program in Aboriginal communities results in a reduction in the reservoir of zoonotic
parasites within communities. The effect of the parasite and breeding control program on the
health status of dogs as well as the population characteristics of dogs in communities was also
investigated.

The study was conducted in 17 Aboriginal communities of the Kimberley region of Western
Australia, divided into three regions according to cultural and geographical attributes. All dogs
from each community were permanently identified using a microchip system. Owners of dogs
were asked the usual location of their animals, the origins of their dogs and the whereabouts of
any missing animals at subsequent visits. Every three months dogs were treated with 200ygikg
iverrnectin (a potent endo- and ecto-parasiticide) subcutaneously and adult female dogs were
treated with an injectable contraceptive (10-30mgkg proligestone) at the request of their
owners. At the time of treatment, dogs were assessed for ecto-parasites and photographs taken
for later comparison and diagnosis of alopecic skin conditions. Faecal and blood samples were
collected every three to six months and skin scrapings were collected from dogs that were
refractory to treatment. The samples were used to determine internal parasite prevalence (using
formal ethyl acetate sedimentation), blood parameters (for anaemia status) and evidence of
scabies or Demodex infestation.

A pilot study at one group of communities, involving weekly assessment of dogs after one
iverrnectin treatment, showed that the treatment was effective in reducing the prevalence of
scabies (as determined by clinical evaluation), hookworm and ticks. The treatment resulted in
improvement in animal health as evidenced by a reduction in the number of dogs with anaemia.

The long-term use of the ivermectin treatments at the other communities showed that over a
period of three years, the prevalence of scabies and hookworm had reduced at most areas. The
initial scabies prevalence varied from 17 to 52% and reduced to below 10% for all communities.
The hookworm infection rates were affected by seasonal factors, as was evidenced by a seasonal
variance in prevalence. Animals that were treated with ivermectin, though, had lower
prevalences of hookworm than those that were not.

There was a reasonable compliance rate for contraceptive treatments for female dogs (greater
than 60% at each visit) and fewer puppies were born within communities when compared with
rates before and after the establishment of the treatment program. High rates of acquisition of
puppies from other communities continued to maintain the dog population numbers despite the
reduction in breeding within communities.

The dog population was young, biased towards male dogs, and very unstable (almost 50% of
dogs died or went missing in a one year period). The rate of dog ownership across the
Kimberley varied according to the region investigated and always remained higher or equal to
ownership rates at the town centres of the Kimberley Region (as determined by a survey
conducted during the study).

Overall the canine parasite and breeding control program resulted in a reduction in scabies and
hookworm prevalence in dogs (and hence a reduction in the potential zoonotic transmission), a
reduction in dog breeding within communities, an improvement in dog health, and an
understanding in the dynamics and health status of dogs within communities.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoonoses</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Kimberley</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal communitiies</field><field name="subject">Canine</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060829.145909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing curriculum change within a state education department region : analysis and conceptualization</field><field name="creator">Bryan Reid</field><field name="description">The major aim of this study was to develop a conceptual model representing the implementation process of a curriculum change occurring in a State Education Department region. This development had its genesis in the now extensive body of literature related to the organizational phenomenon of planned change.
Since its early development in the 1960ts, the study of planned change occurring i n organizations has grown in sophistication, encompassing a steadily evolving number of theoretical constructs. Such a construct, of recent origin, was that of perceiving implementation of the innovation as a discrete process within the total planned change process. Although stillinits infancy, this concept has attracted a steadily growing body of research, The present study co-ordi nated some of these findings to form the basis for a four-stage model representing the implementation process under a special set of circumstances.

The application of the model was tested under field conditions. A longitudinal case study design was adopted because this was ideally suited to test the assumption of implementationas a process. The design was divided in to four sections : concepts related to the decision to change; concepts related to the effect the rationale for implementation had on teachers' behaviour; concepts related to the sequence of involvement of implementers; and finally, concepts related to the measurementof the degree of implementation for teachers and pupils.

Field work was applied inarural educational region of the State of Western Australia. This region was established in 1979 as part of an Australia-wide trend. I t is well documented that at the commencement of the 19701s, Austral ian governmentcontrol led education systems were highly centralized. By the beginning of the 1980ts, all were facing major change, each incorporating some form of decentral ization. In Western Australia, a shift in power from central authorities to Regional Superintendents occurred. With the increase i n power, the Regions received more duties and became more complex organizations.

To meet the demand of testing a complex theoretical model in the intricate field setting of a State Education Department region, a wide range of data-gathering techniques was used. Questionnaires were employed, some specifically designed to suit this study and some selected from other research. The breadth and depth of the data collected was extended by the use of interviews, both focused and unstructured. Information from a wide variety of perspectives was gathered by using direct observation. This was applied to the testing of the theoretical model and also used to validate data drawn from other sources. Content analysis techniques were also used to triangulate the findings from questionnaire and interview techniques.

The findings of the analysis of the data,within a matrix of hypotheses and sub-hypotheses, provided powerful statistical evidence indicating that the innovation was judged as being implemented by the teachers and the pupils. Data collected were also analysed as part of the research plan incorporating four major hypotheses and twenty six sub-sections. Each sub-section has been investigated empirically. This strategy was used to test the applicability of the conceptual model as a technique to represent the process of implementation followed by an innovation in Oral English introduced into a rural region of a State Education Department.

The model proved to be a very effective device, aiding in the comprehension of an implementation process that occurred under the particular conditions described in the thesis.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum change</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060829.160229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organization development and the implementation of planned change</field><field name="creator">John Charles Henderson</field><field name="description">This case study, conducted in a vocational and technical education institution at post secondary level, was concerned with the effects of an organization development intervention on the ability of an organization to implement a planned change initiated by itself.

More specifically, the study hypothesized that organization development, or change to the organization itself, could enhance the process of planned change by the organization.

The study develops at length the concept and theory of implementing planned change, of the critical importance of common understandings and shared expectations to this process, and of the centrality of resocialization
and social interaction in successful implementation.

The study also lists in detail the events and procedures used in this particular organization development intervention, as well as the concept and theory underlying organization development. A number of principles
which guided the author's intervention activities are also listed and examined.

Data on organizational change induced by the intervention were collected over a period of two years through a questionnaire, used for repeated measures, and through participant observation. These data are presented
both quantitatively and qualitatively in the study. The qualitative data are presented in the form Eisner (1979) has described as "educational criticism".

Data on the implementation of planned change were collected through a questionnaire, used for repeated measures, a structured interview technique closely based on the Levels of Use methodology (Ha22 et aZ,
1975), and through participant observation data. Data were again collected over a period of two years and are presented both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The study indicates clearly that the organizational intervention was successful in bringing about organizational change across a broad range of variables. These changes included organizational elements which
research has identified as determinants of the implementation process, The study also indicates that during the period of the intervention the education institution concerned enhanced its ability to implement
planned change, and that this enhanced ability was closely related to the organizational changes which had occurred as a result of the organization development intervention.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational innovations</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060830.120730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prolonged and continuous heat stress in cattle: Physiology, welfare, and electrolyte and nutritional interventions</field><field name="creator">dbeatty@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The live export of cattle is an important industry for Australia. Concerns have arisen about animal welfare and in particular heat stress which may cause production losses and death. Cattle shipped live to the Middle East from a southern Australian winter can face continuous and prolonged periods of high heat and humidity as they cross the equator and arrive into a northern hemisphere summer, leading to heat stress and excessive heat load. Some live animal exporters treat heat stressed cattle with electrolyte supplements, but no scientific data exists as to whether this is beneficial to cattle in these unique environmental conditions. 
In response to industry&#146;s concerns, the experiments described here monitored the physiological responses of Bos taurus and Bos indicus to conditions similar to those experienced by cattle being shipped from southern Australian to the Middle East. Initial experiments were conducted in climate controlled rooms at Murdoch University where intensive monitoring was possible. In the Bos taurus, increases in core body temperature, reductions in feed intake, and increased water intake were measured. There were also changes in blood gas variables consistent with the observed panting causing a compensated respiratory alkalosis. Following the heating period, there were decreases in blood and urinary pH. Bos indicus showed similar responses to the heat, but the changes were less pronounced at the temperatures tested. A pair feeding experiment was conducted to separate the effects of heat from the reductions in feed intake, and this indicated that the major measured effects were due to the responses to heat. On the basis of the measured responses, an electrolyte supplement was formulated and tested on Bos taurus, in the climate controlled rooms, and then on a commercial live export vessel. Results from these experiments indicated improved buffering capacity and a weight advantage for supplemented cattle, even in the absence of extreme heat stress.
A final experiment investigated the effects of amount and quality of roughage in a pelleted feed on core and rumen temperature and feed intakes in Bos taurus subjected to hot environmental conditions in climate controlled rooms at Murdoch University. Both pelleted feeds had approximately the same metabolisable energy and crude protein but differed in content and type of roughage. There were no differences in feed intake, core temperature or rumen temperature between diets. 
This work has led to a greater understanding of the physiological responses of cattle to prolonged and continuous high heat and humidity, the requirements and effects of supplemental electrolytes in these conditions, and the effect of manipulating export diets. The demonstration of advantages in weight and buffering capacity with the electrolyte supplement highlights future areas of research to investigate electrolyte doses, route and types of supplementation, and dietary manipulation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">heat stress</field><field name="subject">live export</field><field name="subject">electrolytes</field><field name="subject">acid base balance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060831.144000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Critical Numeracy at the Tertiary level</field><field name="creator">M.Kemp@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Students at university encounter quantitative information in tables and graphs or through prose in textbooks, journals, electronic sources and in lectures. The degree to which students are able to engage with this kind of information and draw their own conclusions, influences the extent to which they need to rely on the interpretation of others. In particular, students who are studying in non-mathematical disciplines often fail to engage seriously with such material for a number of reasons. These may include a lack of confidence in their ability to do mathematics, a lack of mathematical skills required to understand the data, or a lack of an awareness of the importance of being able to read and interpret the data for themselves. In this thesis, the successful choice and use of skills to interpret quantitative information is referred to as numeracy.
The level of numeracy exhibited by a student can vary depending on the social or cultural context, his/her confidence to engage with the quantitative information, the sophistication of the mathematics required, and his/her ability to evaluate the findings. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the conceptualisation of numeracy and its relationship to mathematics. 
The empirical study that follows this is focused on an aspect of numeracy of importance to university students: the reading and interpreting of tables of data in a range of non-mathematical contexts. The students who participated in this study were enrolled in degree programs in the social sciences. The study was designed to measure the effectiveness of a one-hour intervention workshop aimed at improving the levels of the students&#146; numeracy. The short length of the intervention was dictated by practical and organisational constraints. This workshop involved reading and interpreting a table of data using strategies based on the SOLO taxonomy (Biggs &amp; Collis, 1982). 
The SOLO taxonomy was developed mainly as a means of classifying the quality of responses across both arts and science disciplines. The categorisation uses five levels: prestructural, unistructural, multistructural, relational and extended abstract. It can be used as a diagnostic tool at all levels of education as it can be seen as a spiral learning structure repeating itself with increasing levels of abstraction. It can also be used as a teaching tool in feedback to students. 
A measuring instrument, also based on the SOLO taxonomy, was designed to gauge the levels of the students&#146; responses to these tasks. Each response was allocated a level that was subsequently coded as a number from zero to seven. Because the responses were in distinct ordered categories, it was possible to analyse the scores using the Rasch Model (Rasch 1960/80) for polytomous responses, placing both the difficulty of the tasks and the ability of the students on an equal interval scale. The Rasch Model was also used to evaluate the measuring instrument itself. Some adjustments were made to the instrument in the light of this analysis. It was found that it is possible to construct an instrument to distinguish between levels of students&#146; written responses for each of the chosen table interpretation tasks. 
The workshop was evaluated through a comparison of the levels achieved by individual students before and after the workshop. T-tests for dependent samples indicated a significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01) in student performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">numeracy</field><field name="subject">statistical literacy</field><field name="subject">critical numeracy</field><field name="subject">student learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060831.171947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the Outer - Not on the Outer: Women and Australian Rules Football</field><field name="creator">debbiehindley@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis identifies, examines and probes the nature of women&#146;s involvement in Australian Rules Football. Rather than have a single theoretical underpinning, an interdisciplinary approach, albeit with a feminist perspective, was applied because of the broad scope of the study. Australian Rules Football is an institution that can transcend class, race, and gender. It is also a multi-billion dollar industry. The game traces its origins back to 1858 and claims influences from rugby and an Aboriginal game called marn-grook. While it is played mainly by men, exclusively at league level, interest and involvement is not limited by gender.  

Academics and administrators have frequently written off women&#146;s involvement with football. Even though scholarly interest in both sport and feminism has grown since the 1970s, little significant work has been undertaken to examine women&#146;s interaction with Australian Rules Football. Leading Australian feminist Anne Summers rejected the notion that women could find anything of value in football apart from following players as devoted wives, mothers, girlfriends or &#145;groupies.&#146; Through investigation of monographs and edited collections, I reveal that myriad scholars, feminists and historians have missed the point of sporting scholarship: many women enjoy involvement with football, they understand the game and its strategies and value being part of the football community in diverse and evolving capacities. 

The original contribution to knowledge in this doctorate is to demonstrate that while women have had a central role in the development and maintenance of Australian Rules Football since the game was founded in colonial times, their contribution has gone unacknowledged by historians and administrators. My thesis places on record those omissions. Particularly, I highlight the lack of acknowledgement and respect for the work of a woman who authored a comprehensive and seminal social history written on the game. This is the archetypal example of how women, in many roles &#150; both professional and personal &#150; have been marginalized, despite playing pivotal roles with Australian Rules Football. The original contribution contained in these pages tracks Australian gender relations through the social institution of Australian Rules Football. To create both space and strategies for the revaluation of women in football history, a new model of female fandom is offered. The testimony of the women included is weighty in numbers and pithy in content. The scale of interviews represents diversity in age, class, ethnicity, regionality and role or function with football. Superficially it may appear that women can be placed in taxonomy. Women&#146;s involvement with Australian Rules Football is complex and their involvement enmeshes in the many facets and spheres of the game.

The completion of this thesis follows the long overdue appointment of the A.F.L.&#146;s first female commissioner, Samantha Mostyn, in June 2005. Without disrespecting Mostyn, this was a tokenistic cultural shift by adding a commissioner to the existing eight males with the goal of adding further business expertise, not a new insight or strategic cultural intervention. It also comes at a time when the Australian Football League&#146;s has a new challenge to address, with the growing interest and participation in Association Football in Australia after the qualification for the 2006 World Cup. At this moment of change and contestation, Women&#146;s Australian Rules competitions are impoverished through lack of structural and financial support while women&#146;s Association Football, both in Australia and internationally, is flourishing.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Australian Rules Football</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060913.85805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why circus works : how the values and structures of circus make it a significant developmental experience for young people</field><field name="creator">Reginald Bolton</field><field name="description">Circus is increasingly being used as a developmental and remedial activity for children. However, it is in the paradoxical nature of circus that it operates in a way both mysterious and easily accessible. This thesis proposes that circus as education is more effective when both teacher and student have a better understanding of circus as an art form.

To explain this I first introduce six 'elements' of childhood, whose absence often seems to result in an incomplete personal maturity. Ith en conduct a wide exploration of both the real and the imagined circus, showing how these elements occur or are evoked there, and I establish a correspondence or 'homology' between the two entities - childhood and circus. The discoveries shed light on the aesthetic code of circus itself, leading to the conclusion that circus works as an artform because its essentialcomposition recalls profound experiences of childhood. 

I argue that contemporary Western childhood presents unexpected hazards, mostly involving passivity and over-protection. I n other parts of the world, and in some Western populations, childhood has other problems, linked to deprivation, exploitation and physical danger. I n either case, a child involved in circus activities has a chance to make good some deficits, by experiencing constructive physical risk, aspiration, trust, fun, self-individuation and hard work. My hope is that this dissertation will contribute some strength to the case for well-designed programmes of circus activities for young
people,in both formal and informal settings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Circus</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060915.142429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding Pastorally to the Ageing Population:  With a Proposed Training Programme for Clergy and Lay Pastoral Workers</field><field name="creator">blennard@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The increased longevity in contemporary western society is impacting on many service and caring organisations in that they are needing to find ways of responding to the increasing number of older persons who need support.  The Church is not immune from this as statistics demonstrate that the age demographic within the Church is rapidly changing to include many more older persons.  However, evidence is strong that the Church to date has not been as alert as it could have been to the implications of the ageing population, nor has it been awake to the potential available within adult ministry.  Therefore scholars and gerontologists are strident in their attempts to wake the Church from its slumber with respect to responding to the ageing population.

The impetus of this research was to determine how alert the Anglican Diocese of Perth is to this rapidly increasing age demographic, and how well equipped its clergy and lay pastoral workers are to respond to the increasing number of older persons both within the Church and within society.  To achieve this, a survey was conducted amongst a selection of clergy and lay pastoral workers in the Diocese of Perth.  As part of the survey, comments were sought from participants on how important they believed training in ministry to older persons was for them, and what factors would enable and encourage them to attend training in this area. 

The literature reviewed for this research, the survey results, and the ensuing discussion combine to underline the need for ministry to older persons to be taken seriously by the Church.  As a way of stimulating interest, and equipping clergy and lay pastoral workers, in the area of pastoral care of older persons, this thesis provides the structure of a training programme that it is envisaged will be offered to the Anglican Diocese of Perth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older persons</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">pastoral care</field><field name="subject">spiritual care</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20060920.200853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma and Post-internment Japanese Diasporic Literature</field><field name="creator">teresamgoudie@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the literary archive of the Japanese diaspora in North America and uncovers evidence of an intergenerational transmission of trauma after the internment of all peoples of Japanese descent in America during World War Two. Their experience of migration, discrimination and displacement was exacerbated by the internment, the single most influential episode in their history which had a profound effect on subsequent generations.  It is argued the trauma of their experiences can be located in their writing and, drawing on the works of Freud and trauma theoreticians Cathy Caruth and Ruth Leys in particular, the thesis constructs a theoretical framework which may be applied to post-internment Japanese diasporic writing to reveal the traces of trauma in all generations, traces that are linked to what Freud referred to as a posterior moment that triggered an earlier trauma which the subject may not have experienced personally but which may be lodged in her / her psyche. An examination of the literature of the Japanese diaspora shows that trauma is carried in the language itself and impacted upon the collective psyche of the entire community.

The theoretical model is used to read the tanka poetry written by the immigrant generation, a range of texts by the first American-born generation (including an in-depth analysis of four texts spanning several decades) and the texts written by the third-generation, many of whom did not experience the internment themselves so their motivation and the influence of the internment differed greatly from earlier generations.  The thesis concludes with an analysis of David Mura's identification of the link between identity, sexuality and the influence of the internment experience as transmitted by his parents.  The future of the Japanese American community and their relationship with their past traumatic experience also makes its way into the conclusion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese Americans</field><field name="subject">internment</field><field name="subject">trauma</field><field name="subject">diaspora</field><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061012.65617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of End User Development Success</field><field name="creator">T.Mcgill@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">User development of applications provides end users with an alternative to the traditional process of systems development by allowing them to solve job related problems by developing their own software applications. User developed applications (UDAs) support decision making and organisational processes in the majority of organisations, and the ability to develop small applications forms part of the job requirements for many positions. Despite its pervasiveness, there are many risks associated with user development of applications. These risks result primarily from decreases in application quality that arise when end users have had little training and do not follow system development methodologies. 

The primary aim of the research described in this thesis is to gain a better understanding of UDA success. In particular, the thesis considers the role of system quality in UDA success and the ability of end user developers to judge whether the applications they develop will have a positive impact on their performance of tasks. The research also investigates factors that might impact upon this ability. 

The research objectives were addressed through two empirical studies. Two possible models of UDA success provided the starting point for Study 1. The first model is DeLone and McLean&#146;s (1992) model of IS success, and the second model is a version of this model that was modified to address concerns about the DeLone and McLean model and to reflect current research about UDA success. The models were tested using data from a field study involving business people participating in a business policy simulation, where they developed spreadsheet applications to assist in decision making. Structural equation modelling was used to test the models. Neither of the models was well supported by the data. However, the analysis provided strong support for relationships between perceived system quality and user satisfaction, information quality and user satisfaction, user satisfaction and intended use, and user satisfaction and individual impact. It is notable that the model paths that were supported in Study 1 were primarily those that reflect user perceptions rather than objective measures. This study highlighted that user perceptions of information systems success play a significant role in the UDA domain. The results did, however, suggest that there might be a direct relationship between system quality and individual impact. 

Study 2 was a laboratory experiment and the participants were end users from a range of organisations. A revised research model was developed based on the findings of Study 1, and structural equation modelling was again used to test the model. The model paths that were supported suggest that for small to moderate applications, increases in spreadsheet development knowledge lead to increases in system quality and consequently the development of better quality spreadsheets. They also suggest that for these kinds of applications, end users have realistic perceptions of system quality and hence that user satisfaction may be an appropriate measure of UDA success. The results of Study 2 also provided insight into the role of user involvement in end user development, clarifying the process by which benefits are obtained. The study also provided insight into the importance of spreadsheet development knowledge for successful use (as well as development) of a spreadsheet application. 

The results described in this thesis have practical implications for the management of user development of applications. They highlight the need either to increase end user levels of development knowledge via training so that end users can cope with applications of greater complexity, or to provide other forms of support for development. The role of organisational standards and guidelines is also be considered in the thesis and it is suggested that there is a particular need for guidelines on what kinds of applications are suitable for end user development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">end user</field><field name="subject">end user development</field><field name="subject">spreadsheet</field><field name="subject">system quality</field><field name="subject">user satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061017.121011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charecterisation of the Ovine Model of McArdle's Disease: Development of therapeutic Strategies.</field><field name="creator">Kendallw@cyllene.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Characterisation of the Ovine Model of McArdle&#146;s Disease: Development of Therapeutic Strategies.
McArdle&#146;s disease (OMIM 232600) is one of the most common glycogen storage diseases affecting skeletal muscle. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by a defect in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase gene (PYGM) (Ch 11q13), a key metabolic enzyme. As a result, patients are unable to mobilise muscle glucose stores to provide the energy for muscle contraction; and suffer from exercise intolerance (myalgia, tachycardia, breathlessness and early fatigue) as well as cramps / contractures and occasionally rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria after bouts of strenuous exercise. Histopathologically, McArdle&#146;s disease is characterised by an increase in subsarcolemmal storage of glycogen and reduced or absent glycogen phosphorylase activity. McArdle&#146;s disease displays significant genetic heterogeneity, with 47 different disease-causing mutations in PYGM having been identified in human sufferers. In keeping with this genetic heterogeneity, significant molecular heterogeneity is observed in patients with regard to the effect of the disease-causing mutation on the PYGM mRNA transcript. In contrast, little biochemical heterogeneity is associated with the disease, with approximately 90% of human patients having no residual pygm protein and therefore no enzyme activity.

A naturally occurring ovine model of McArdle&#146;s disease was identified a number of years ago in a flock of merino sheep in Western Australia. The disease causing mutation responsible for ovine McArdle&#146;s disease was identified and published in 1997 by Tan et al., (1997) [1]. The mutation occurs in the 3&#146; acceptor splice-site of intron 19 of the ovine PYGM gene, resulting in the activation of a cryptic splice-site site in exon 20 and the premature termination of the transcript. Hypothetically this mutant pygm protein should be 31 amino acids smaller than the wild-type. When I began my PhD, it was known that the ovine sufferers displayed exercise intolerance and histological examination of affected muscle revealed an excess subsarcolemmal storage of glycogen and absent phosphorylase, as occurs in their human counterparts. Due to their similarities in muscle mass to humans and the relative ease and low cost of maintenance, the ovine model of McArdle&#146;s disease is an important and highly relevant test-bed for therapeutic strategies. 

This thesis can essentially be divided into two parts:
1) The characterisation of the ovine model of McArdle&#146;s disease-
In particular, determining the effect of the disease-causing mutation on both the PYGM mRNA and protein, characterising the sequences of the ovine glycogen phosphorylase isoforms and their developmental and tissue specific expression patterns, as well as determining the identity and the activity of the glycogen phosphorylase isoforms expressed in certain muscle groups (cardiac, extraocular and smooth muscles) which appear to be protected from the disease. 

Based upon this data and making use of the ovine model;
2) Development of therapeutic strategies-
A number of potential therapeutic strategies were investigated including: 
&#149;	The upregulation of a functionally related gene, through the re-expression of non-muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase via notexin induced muscle regeneration. 
&#149;	As well as the replacement of the PYGM gene using modified adenovirus 5 (AdV5) and adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV-2) vectors. 

Based upon the ability of the non-muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase to function in-vivo in McArdle&#146;s muscle in the absence of the muscle isoform, the ability of tributyrin (a butyrate prodrug and potent histone deacetylase inhibitor) to re-express brain glycogen phosphorylase in mature mouse muscle was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">x</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.125658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variation of flour colour in Western Australia adapted wheat: comparative genomics, molecular markers and QTL analysis</field><field name="creator">kryan@ccg.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The yellowness of flour colour ranges is an important quality trait in wheat for end-use products and is determined by the accumulation of carotenoids in the endosperm.  The aims of this study were to develop EST-based molecular markers for genes encoding enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway leading to xanthophyll accumulation and identify quantitative trait loci for flour colour (b*) and xanthophyll content in Western Australian adapted germplasm.  
A novel bioinformatic strategy was developed to identify rice genes encoding key enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and to predict wheat orthologues on the short arm of chromosome 3 or long arm of chromosome 7.  The bioinformatic strategy involved the identification of rice carotenoid genes on BAC/PAC contigs aligned to wheat mapped ESTs.  Rice genes predicted to have wheat orthologues were selected based on ESTs mapping to regions on wheat homoeologous chromosomes 3 and 7 known to be involved in flour colour.  The rice genes predicted to have wheat orthologues were Geranylgeranyltransferase I &#131;&#210;&#161;Vsubunit (GGT-Ibeta) and Rab geranylgeranyltransferase component A (RGGT-A) on the short arm of chromosome 3, Lycopene &#131;&#210;&#161;Vcylcase (LBC) on the long arm of chromosome 3 and Lycopene &#163;`&#161;Vcylcase (LEC) on the long arm of chromosome 7.  
The prediction of these wheat orthologues provided the basis for development of EST-based molecular markers for detecting variation in xanthophyll content.  Wheat ESTs with unknown chromosomal locations and having the highest similarity to GGT-Ibeta, RGGT-A and LBC were selected for the development of molecular markers.  No EST homologues were identified for LEC and therefore this gene was not further considered.  Orthology was confirmed by sequencing and deletion lines were used to confirm chromosomal locations.  Two partial orthologues of GGT-Ibeta were identified on the short arms of chromosomes 3B and 3D.  A partial orthologue of RGGT-A was mapped to the proximal regions of the short and long arms of chromosome 3B.  At least two or more orthologues of LBC were identified from nullisomic-tetrasomic lines.  An EST-based molecular marker for GGT-Ibeta was found to be involved in minor variation of xanthophyll content in a Westonia*2/Janz doubled haploid population.  
QTL analysis from three doubled haploid populations indicated variation in WA-adapted germplasm may be due to different alleles controlling flour colour.  QTLs for b* and xanthophyll content were found to coincide on the short arms of chromosomes 3A, 4D, and 7B and the long arm of chromosomes 7A and 7B in WA-adapted germplasm.  Homoeologous expression of regions controlling variation in b* and xanthophyll content on the long arm of chromosomes 7A and 7B suggests the shut-down of genes in the same region on chromosome 7D.  The main outcome of this study is flour colour and identification of gene orthologues in wheat controlling variation in xanthophyll content is complex most likely because of the interaction of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with other pathways.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flour colour</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.130337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing Nature: The Infinite in the Flesh</field><field name="creator">Vicvang@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relation between two interpretations of ch&#244;ra, drawn from a
reading of Plato&#146;s Timaeus. The first I label the elemental ch&#244;ra. The second, I call the
social ch&#244;ra. The first chapter addresses the elements in Ionian philosophy, with an eye
toward the political and social backdrop of the important cosmological notion of
isonomia, law of equals. Here social and elemental are continuous. Chapter two looks
at the next phase of Presocratic thought, Elea, specifically Parmenides and his influence
on later thought, then turns to Heidegger&#146;s reading of Parmenides&#146; through the key word
of al&#234;theia. Finally, I offer a reading of Parmenides through a different key word&#151;
trust. The third chapter examines Plato&#146;s cosmology in the Timaeus, focusing on the
way the beginning of this dialogue inflects the dialogue in a political/social direction,
putting the social ch&#244;ra in tension with the elemental ch&#244;ra that the body of the
Timaeus&#146; discusses. In the fourth chapter, which examines the Phaedrus, this tension is
inverted, since this dialogue on writing and justice set in what proves to be the
mesmerizing and erotic elemental milieu of the world outside the walls of the polis.
The second half of the dissertation turns to some modern thinkers within the
phenomenological tradition or its wake who write about elementals. Chapter five
examines Gaston Bachelard&#146;s reveries on imagination which dream the natural world of
fire, air, water, and earth from the standpoint of what he calls material and dynamic
imagination, concepts that imply a strong sense of embodiment. Chapter six treats
Levinas&#146; description of the elemental and fixes it in a stark relation to the human. I will
suggest some possible points of contact between the elemental and the social in
Levinas. Chapter seven turns to John Sallis&#146; analysis of the imagination as the means of
access proper to the elemental in ways that differ from Bachelard. He position the earth
as a fundamental other. I will suggest that in the end his position inherits Heidegger&#146;s
lack of emphasis on embodied and needy humanity. Alphonso Lingis offers his own
unique reading of the elemental in a more Levinasian and Merleau-Pontian vein,
speaking of the directives the world, both human and natural, puts to us, and returning
to a philosophy of substance that puts the body in the picture. Chapter eight uses his
thought to focus the issue of the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chora</field><field name="subject">flesh</field><field name="subject">plato</field><field name="subject">levinas</field><field name="subject">nature</field><field name="subject">elemental</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.130930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Pathology of Devil Facial Tumour Disease in Tasmanian Devils (Sarcophilus Harrisii)</field><field name="creator">thefishvet@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The pathology of a disfiguring and debilitating fatal disease affecting a
high proportion of the wild population of Tasmanian Devils (Sarcophilus
harrisii) that was discovered is described. The disease, named devil
facial tumour disease (DFTD), has been identified in devils found across
60% of the Tasmanian landscape. The prevalence of this disease was
extremely variable, possibly reflecting seasonal trapping success.
Between 2001 and 2004, 91 DFTD cases were obtained for pathological
description. Grossly, the tumours presented as large, solid, soft tissue
masses usually with flattened, centrally ulcerated and exudative surfaces.
They were typically multi-centric, appearing first in the oral, face or neck
regions. Histologically, the tumours were composed of circumscribed to
infiltrative nodular aggregates of round to spindle-shaped cells often
within a pseudocapsule and divided into lobules by delicate fibrous
septae. They were locally aggressive and metastasised in 65% of cases.
There was minimal cytological differentiation amongst the tumour cell
population under light and electron microscopy. The diagnostic values of
a number of immunohistochemical stains were employed to further
characterise up to 50 representative cases. They were negative for
cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, von Willebrand factor, desmin,
glial fibrillary acid protein, CD16, CD57, CD3 and LSP1. DFTD cells were
positive for vimentin, S-100, melan A, neuron specific enolase,
chromogranin A and synaptophysin. In conclusion, the morphological
and immunohistochemical characteristics together with the primary
distribution of the neoplasms indicate that DFTD is an undifferentiated
neoplasm of neuroendocrine histogenesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tasmanian devil</field><field name="subject">sarcophilus harrisii</field><field name="subject">neoplasia</field><field name="subject">NET</field><field name="subject">DFTD tumour</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.131524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multivariate Adaptive Trimmed Likelihood Algorithm</field><field name="creator">Daniel.Schubert@csiro.au</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis describes a new algorithm which can be used to

challenges surrounding sustainable land use of rangelands by European leaseholders
in Western Australia. A study of historical, socio-economic and technological events,
combined with the development of social values and policy, exposed a broad suite of
factors that shaped pastoralism and grazing, and continues to influence development
in these regions today. The thesis also explained how the emergence of the
sustainable development paradigm is raising awareness of the ways societies define
the issues of development, and the influence of this paradigm on attempts to shape
change.
Extensive changes in animal production systems have been made in response to
complex factors driving change in pastoralism and grazing in recent years. In the
Upper Gascoyne, the change to cattle has resulted in extensive changes in
infrastructure and raised new hopes for viable production systems in the future.
Station amalgamation or sale of stations to Government Departments have been key
factors of change in this region. In the Mt Magnet region, wool production remains
dominant. However severe drought conditions and declining wool prices are
increasingly forcing change to production of feral goats or Damara sheep.
Increasing conflict in the rangelands centred around competing claims to land and its
use, against a backdrop of dry seasons and changing socio-economics, are escalating
leaseholders&#146; fears and concerns about growing community demands for multiple
rangeland use. Government approaches now focus on multiple use of rangelands,
providing incentives or opportunities to develop alternative methods of use for rangeland resources. However, environmental barriers to sustainable land use and
diverse perceptions of sustainability continue to create difficulties for developing
effective policies and strategies for change. There is now an urgent need for a
paradigm shift in attitudes towards rangelands that promotes more sustainable uses
for the land, a greater equality in sharing resources and constructive integration of
the values of all rangeland stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.133353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boys in and out of school:Narratives of early school leaving</field><field name="creator">D.Hodgson@ecu.edu.au</field><field name="description">Research and public attention into boys&#146; education has increased in recent times among
an emerging concern about the performance and retention of boys in schools. This
concern, in many ways, constitutes a &#147;moral panic&#148; (Foster, Kimmel &amp; Skelton, 2001,
p.1) sometimes producing generalised and alarming statements such as &#145;all boys are
underachieving in school&#146; and are therefore becoming the &#147;new disadvantaged&#148; (Foster,
et, al., 2001, p.7). Alongside these populist concerns about boys in schools generally, is
an emerging body of contemporary academic studies into early school leaving, (Trent &amp;
Slade, 2001; Smyth, Hattam, Cannon, Edwards, Wilson &amp; Wurst,. 2000; Smyth &amp;
Hattam, 2004) boys&#146; experiences of schooling, (Martino &amp; Pallotta-Chiarolli, 2003), as
well as some broader statistical evidence indicating a general decline in school retention
rates in Australia since the early 1990s (Lamb, 1998). Performance in schools
generally, and declining retention rates specifically, has been described as an
&#147;unacknowledged national crisis&#148; (Smyth &amp; Hattam, 2002, p.375).

This study investigates boys&#146; education generally and early school leaving specifically,
by focusing on boys who leave school before completing year 10. The study explores
the stories, meanings and constructed experiences of a small sample (5) of young boys
aged 14 &#150; 16 years, who have left secondary school just prior to being interviewed.
This is a qualitative critical ethnographic (L. Harvey, 1990) study located within a
constructivist epistemology (Crotty, 1998). It aims to investigate early school leaving
through narrative (Cortazzi, 1993; Way, 1997) and ethnographic inspired analysis
(Robson, 2002) of transcribed interview data. Such analyses are referenced against a
macro socio-political, economic, and cultural context characterised by changing global
socio-economic and political circumstances, especially in regard to how these impact on
schools and future possibilities for young people (Spierings, 2002). It seeks further
understanding by drawing from a framework of concepts that invoke discussion of
school culture, identity practices and how these are inferred (Smyth &amp; Hattam, 2004),
produced, understood and enacted within schools and social contexts.

This study reveals that schools (as cultural and institutional practices) co-construct the
often painful, lengthy and contradictory processes and experiences of early school
leaving. Early school leaving therefore needs to be seen as an institutional and not
merely personal or individual phenomenon. Appreciating the way schools assist in the
process of early school leaving is important to understand, as it is within this domain
that alternative educational practices can be located, constructed and enacted. It is
hoped that this study will contribute to the current public policy debates on boys in
schools, and as such be seen as an important contribution to public discourses and
policy processes that help shape responses to boys in schools in general, and early
school leaving in particular.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boys eduction</field><field name="subject">early school leaving</field><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="subject">sociolgy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.140656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular andImmunogenic Analysis of Jembrana Disease Virus Tat</field><field name="creator">ssetiyan@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease is an acute and severe disease of Bali cattle (Bos javanicus)
endemic in Indonesia that is caused by a bovine lentivirus designated Jembrana
disease virus (JDV). Previous studies have demonstrated that it is possible to
induce a protective immunity against the disease by immunisation with a crude
whole virus vaccine prepared from the tissues of infected cattle. This vaccine has
been demonstrated to ameliorate the clinical signs of disease resulting from
exposure to virus infection but a safer vaccine amenable to commercial
production techniques is required.
JDV, like all lentiviruses, encodes a transcriptional trans-activator Tat protein that
is encoded from one or both of two exons of the tat gene. Tat is particularly
essential for virus replication and it was hypothesised that the induction of an
immune response in cattle against JDV Tat may effect protection against virus
infection. Investigations were therefore conducted on JDV Tat to provide basic
information on the protein that would enable it to be further investigated as a
potential immunogen for incorporation into vaccines for the control of Jembrana
disease.
Analysis of tat transcripts obtained from tissues of cattle infected with three
strains of JDV suggested that, during the acute clinical disease, Tat produced at
this stage of the disease process was translated from the first coding exon only.
Nucleotide variation in this exon, which would have translated into amino acid
variations in the Tat protein, was evident especially between strains from
geographically different regions of Indonesia. There was; however, conservation
of the essential functional domains of cysteine-rich, core and basic regions, which
suggested immunity to a single Tat protein might protect against infection by
heterologous strains. Subsequent studies on Tat reported in the thesis therefore
concentrated on the protein encoded by tat exon 1 of a single strain of JDV. The exon 1 of tat was cloned into the pGEX vector and recombinant Tat
expressed in Escherichia coli. Methods for the purification of the expressed
protein were developed. Immunogenicity of the recombinant protein was initially
demonstrated by inoculation of the protein into a sheep which developed a high
titred specific antibody response. Antibodies induced by this recombinant protein
recognised native Tat proteins produced by three JDV strains in Bali cattle and
provided a valuable reagent for the subsequent detection of Tat in vitro and in
vivo.
Aspects of the antibody response to Tat were determined in cattle that had been
infected naturally or experimentally with JDV, and compared with the levels of
antibody to the immunodominant capsid protein. Tat antibodies were detected in
23 % of 128 Bali cattle from Jembrana disease-endemic areas of Indonesia; in all
these cattle, evidence of previous virus infection had been demonstrated by
detection of antibody to the JDV capsid protein by Western blot analysis. In cattle
experimentally infected with JDV, low levels of serum antibody to Tat were
detected by Western blot in the first month post-infection but the levels of
antibody then decreased; levels of antibody to the JDV capsid protein increased
over the 6-month observation period following infection. The detection of Tatantibody
soon after the acute clinical disease suggested that this protein is
secreted extracellularly during JDV infection in cattle. In contrast to the antibody
response to Tat in JDV-infected cattle, an apparently greater antibody response
to Tat was induced by injection of recombinant Tat in Bali cattle. The strong
antibody response resulting from inoculation of the recombinant Tat and low
levels of Tat antibody in animals that had been naturally or experimentally
infected with virus suggested there might be a conformational difference in the
recombinant and native Tat protein and that the native protein was a poor
immunogen, or that the levels of Tat in infected cattle were too low to induce a
strong antibody response. As an alternative means of inducing an immune response to JDV Tat, perhaps
one associated with a greater cell-mediated rather than an antibody response, a
candidate tat DNA vaccine was produced by insertion of tat exon 1 into a DNA
vaccine vector. Transfection of this naked DNA plasmid into mammalian cells
induced the expression of a functional Tat protein which maintained antigenicity.
The results suggested this construct merits further animal studies attempting to
induce a protective immune response against Jembrana disease in cattle. A
method of assaying the trans-acting function of Tat was also developed which will
have application for quality control procedures for large-scale production of tat
DNA vaccine.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jembrana disease</field><field name="subject">c attle</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.150917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rock n Roll Cinema</field><field name="creator">a.trainer@curtin.edu.my</field><field name="description">Popular music and film are separate media, framed by specific discourses, histories of
distribution and reception, semiotic relationships and literacies. Through these divergent
manifestations and ideologies nodes of convergence exist. At moments of connection,
new and innovative textual and contextual possibilities emerge, transforming the ways in
which audiences both engage and read these media. Whilst often driven by capitalist
goals, both popular music and film capture and tether personal expression and collective
memory. Through these processes of signification, popular cultural texts belonging to
both media forms are able to resist their commodified origins to inform and construct
both collective and individual identities.
This thesis charts the movement of popular music across cinema. Rock&#146;n&#146;Roll is utilized
not only as an amalgam of texts made up of sounds and images, but also as a critical and
interpretative apparatus through which specific cultural identities are configured. This
work is concerned with various manifestations of political resistance in popular culture,
and the ways in which this resistance is moderated through cultural commodification.
Using an interdisciplinary approach &#150; converging film analysis, popular music studies
and music journalism &#150; this thesis constructs an ideological framework through which
film and popular music can be aligned, and through which this alignment can be
researched.
Through an engagement with myriad cinematic and popular cultural texts, executed  through interdisciplinary methods, this thesis establishes a theoretical framework for
understanding and analyzing the convergence of popular music and cinema. Its original
contribution to knowledge is an evaluation of the ways in which these media are changed
through their alignment and how they inform each other both structurally, as tangible
manifestations of specific media codes and structures, and politically, in the ideological
embodiment of particular identities and representational realities. This goal is achieved
through the selection of specific research materials, especially those which have not been
subject to detailed investigation in other scholarly studies. Specific filmic and musical
texts are discussed because they embody the aesthetic and political synergy of these two
media forms as well as demonstrating the cultural processes through which this synergy
is enacted.
This thesis offers interdisciplinary dialogue as a valid strategy to understand the
processes involved in the creation and reception of texts which are cinematic in nature
but utilize the language and discourse of popular music. The textual and contextual
manifestations of this process are a primary concern. Emphasis is placed on the
implications for film form in terms of the structure of texts and their existence within
specific genres, the shifting position of the auteur and the renegotiation of the term and its
meaning to film and popular music, and the conjunction and interaction between
creativity and commerce. In addressing the political and aesthetic possibilities of the film
and popular music hybrid, as well as the cultural implications of their convergence, this
thesis provides new perspectives for the analysis of both forms.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.151505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#147;You have to hit some people, it&#146;s all they understand!&#148;:
Are Violent Sentiments More Criminogenic than Attributing Hostile Intent in the escalation of grievances?</field><field name="creator">sallyfstevenson@yahoo.co.uk</field><field name="description">Is it what adult violent offenders think or how they think that discriminates them most
from non-offenders? This study investigates whether violent and criminal sentiments,
attributional biases and violence based grievance resolution strategies represent dynamic
criminogenic risk factors. The results indicate that it is what offenders think that
discriminates them more than how they think.
The participants were 546 adults comprising 105 violent offenders, 238 university
students and 203 men and women from a stratified random community sample. Using
interview data from high-risk violent offenders, two scales were specifically developed to
measure the variables of interest. The differences between offenders and non-offenders in
violent attitudes was measured by expanding the scope of the Criminal Sentiments Scale.
The differences in attributional biases and problem solving was assessed by a second
scale developed for this study.
The results showed that offenders were clearly different from non-offenders with the
offenders endorsing significantly higher criminal and violent sentiments with an effect
size of h2 =.46. The offenders also reported a significantly higher level of violence-based
resolution strategies to end grievances than non-offenders. However, the surprising
finding was that the adult male high-risk offenders did not demonstrate more pronounced
hostile attributional biases than either adult men and women students or men and women
from the community. The results imply that believing violence is acceptable and being
prepared to use violence is more criminogenic than how you interpret the social
behaviour of others. These findings have important implications for our understanding of
why grievances escalate and the development of more effective intervention programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">offenders</field><field name="subject">criminals</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.152626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Archi-texture : meditations on the mediations of dwelling</field><field name="creator">wendyseana@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This thesis is an inter-disciplinary and inter- cultural exploration of home as understood as the place in which we usually live.

Motivated by an interest in what threads contribute to the weave of contemporary household dwelling, this thesis revisits the two questions used by Heidegger to frame his essay &#145;Building Dwelling Thinking&#146;: &#147;What is it to dwell?&#148; and &#147;How does building belong to dwelling?&#148; It is an inquiry committed to its respondents as bearers and representatives of &#145;structures of feeling&#146; circulating within the socio-cultural milieu or habitus in which they live and engage with the idea of &#145;home.&#146; This inquiry offers an exploration of the chief constituent mediums of home which I call its &#145;archi-texture&#146;. As such, it looks at location, physical and material attributes, domestic technology and household membership as framed by the presence or absence of a family. This thesis is almost certainly the only example of an empirically grounded examination of Heidegger&#146;s ontological exposition of dwelling.

they age. A lifespan developmental perspective is employed in investigating the
effects of societal aging stereotypes on will-to-live and risk-taking skills. Results
suggest negative aging stereotypes may have deleterious effects on the elderly, but
not young individuals in terms of will-to-live, but have no effect on risk-taking
abilities. Furthermore, a cross-cultural analysis of Americans and Japanese reveals
robust differences in self-concept between countries, which in turn partially mediate
the effects of culture and age on control strategies. It appears culture and age may
play important roles in determining individuals&#146; self-concept, motivation, and
regulation of behavior.

The first part of Study 1 examined whether stereotypes of aging contribute to
decisions the elderly make about when to die. Elderly and young participants (n =
64) were subliminally primed with either negative or positive stereotypes of old age
using a computer, and then responded to hypothetical medical situations involving
potentially fatal illnesses. Consistent with my prediction, the aged participants
primed with negative stereotypes tended to refuse life-prolonging interventions,
whereas those primed with positive age stereotypes tended to accept the
interventions. This priming effect did not emerge among the young participants for
whom the stereotypes were less relevant. The results suggest that sociallytransmitted
negative stereotypes of aging can weaken elderly will-to-live, or at the
very least, willingness to pursue medical intervention.

The second part of Study 1 examined whether the older adults demonstrate
similar risk-taking skills to the younger adults, and whether this ability is preserved,
even after exposure to age stereotypes. Sixteen young and 16 older participants were
tested on a risk-taking decision task following exposure to subliminal aging
stereotypes. In all conditions, both the old and young participants systematically and
equivalently increased their willingness to take risks as risk level decreased.
Furthermore, response times were an inverted U shape curve with slower response
times recorded at the medium risk level and faster times as risk levels shifted up or
down. The findings suggest the ability to make decisions based on risk level is
maintained into old age.

Study 2 investigated results reported by a number of studies finding that
primary control remains stable in old age, is lower in Asian countries, and that
secondary control increases in old age and is higher in Asian countries. I examined
whether these patterns may be due to the mediating influence of an interdependent
self-concept. In a sample of 557 young and older adults in Japan and the United
States, primary and secondary control, age, and interdependence were studied. I
found that interdependence partially mediated the influence of culture on secondary
control and interdependence partially mediated the influence of age on both primary
and secondary control. Findings suggest that interdependence is an important factor
that should be considered in trying to understand the determinants of control crossculturally
and developmentally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lifespan</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">stereotypes</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">developmental</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">stereotyping</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">risk taking</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061020.101103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Textual Criticism and the Synoptic Question - A study based on the Passion Narrative</field><field name="creator">marc.chan05@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Since the eighteenth century, various hypotheses have been proposed by scholars in an attempt to solve the Synoptic Question.  Most of these scholars have used more or less the same Greek text, yet they have come up with different conclusions.  So, the question arises whether it is possible to find a trend in the manuscripts dating up to the fifth century which sheds additional clues on the relationships among the Synoptic Gospels.  To address this, I have taken the text of the 27th edition of Nestle-Aland as the basis for analysis through the use of the colour-coded scheme proposed by the Karawara Gospels Project.  However, in the same colour-coding exercise, the variant readings from the relevant manuscripts are also displayed.  This facilitates the identification of any particularities. 

Since the Synoptic Gospels contain too much to cover within the constraints of this research project, there is a need to select enough material to make the study relevant.  The passion narrative has been selected on the basis of its content and the generally agreed closeness of the texts in all three Synoptic Gospels.  So, all the sections, as defined in the Aland Synopsis, in the Triple Tradition are colour-coded and analysed.  The relevant variant readings in these sections are also taken into consideration.  To display the colour-coding more accurately, it was found that a commonly used and available format is more appropriate since printing is still not a viable alternative.  Thus, all the colour-coded sections, as found on the attached CD ROM, are converted into the PDF format and the Adobe Acrobat Reader, widely available through the Internet, can be used to view them.  This study has pointed out that in spite of the commonly agreed closeness of the texts, that of Luke varies quite markedly from the other two.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textual Criticism</field><field name="subject">Synoptic Question</field><field name="subject">Synoptic Gospels</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061020.84843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transitions between ecological regimes in salinising wetlands</field><field name="creator">L.Sim@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Secondary salinisation has affected large areas of inland southwestern Australia, and in particular, low lying aquatic areas; causing the loss of freshwater submerged
macrophyte communities and their replacement by salt-tolerant species. At high salinities, the salt-tolerant macrophyte-dominated ecological regime may be replaced by
a regime dominated by benthic microbial communities, further reducing the structural and functional diversity of salinised wetland ecosystems. There is little prospect of restoring salinised systems to a freshwater state, meaning that saline macrophyte dominated wetlands have a heightened structural and functional importance in this
landscape. Prior to this study, little was known about the drivers for change from one ecological regime to another in salinising wetlands or about rates of ecosystem response
to these drivers. 

This study used experimental and observational data from seven saline wetlands in order to identify some of the potential mechanisms for the transition between the salt tolerant submerged macrophyte-dominated regime and the benthic microbial community-dominated regime. The applicability of existing conceptual models for ecological regime shifts was then tested against these data. Some of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of the macrophyte-dominated regime were explored by examining the effects of salinity on germination and flowering in a series of salt-tolerant submerged macrophytes. The initiation and dominance of benthic microbial communities over a range of salinity and wetting regimes was also examined.

The results suggested that macrophyte communities are unlikely to develop in seasonally-drying wetlands at high salinities (&gt;45 ppt), but will usually germinate and
establish well at lower salinities. It was also predicted that although benthic microbial communities can survive and grow across a wide range of salinities, they are likely to be outcompeted at low salinities by macrophytes or by phytoplankton blooms if water column nutrient levels are high. However, water permanence may facilitate benthic
microbial community dominance.

Existing conceptual models of ecological regime transitions, such as the alternative regimes model, did not account for the effect of water regime on the dynamics of seasonally-drying systems. Therefore, a new conceptual model incorporating the interaction between hydrology and salinity in seasonally-drying wetlands was proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wetland</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">salinisation</field><field name="subject">alternative regime</field><field name="subject">macrophyte</field><field name="subject">microbe</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061020.92805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shelter in the Storm:Business Turmoil and Marketing Strategy Effectiveness</field><field name="creator">alewandowska@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Numerous studies have shown a positive association between the marketing concept and performance, however, it is not clear to what degree this relationship is moderated by the business environment. It is also uncertain which dimensions of the Narver and Slater (1990) measure of market orientation explain the relationship. Research conducted in four countries (Australia, China, Singapore and the Netherlands) of 217 companies found a strong association between market orientated strategies and company performance. Further, results of the research suggest that a customer orientated strategy may be a more appropriate strategy for a company to pursue when operating in a disturbed reactive or a turbulent business environment. The societal marketing concept, was found to be positively associated with company performance, and used as a 'pre-emptive' strategy by firms operating in a placid clustered environment. It would thus seem that a customer orientated strategy is more important in  very turbulent environments, such as those after September 11th, 2001, than first thought.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061020.95514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Goal Setting for Sustainability: A New Method of Environmental Education</field><field name="creator">sheehy@essun1.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">If current environmental problems are to be addressed and future environmental problems are to be prevented, significant changes are needed in the way people live. Environmental education has been identified as an important tool for encouraging people to make the changes needed for sustainability. However, environmental education has been largely ineffective in doing this. Education about the environment is being achieved, but education that creates the skills and motivation for action is not. 

The purpose of this research was to investigate the potential of goal setting to be used in environmental education programs to develop the skills and motivation required to change environmental behaviour and create positive environmental outcomes. Goal setting is one of the most replicable and reliable of psychology theories, with extensive evidence of its benefits for increasing performance and changing behaviour. The premise of this research was to take an already proven and well-established behaviour change theory and apply it within environmental education programs.

The first step was to develop a framework, which enabled goal setting to be incorporated into a program. To do this the environmental behaviour change literature was reviewed and the components of successful environmental education were identified and incorporated into the framework. The goal setting literature was also reviewed to determine the characteristics of an effective goal and how goal setting could be facilitated to create greater goal achievement. As there has been little research on the community&#146;s attitudes towards goal setting a questionnaire was developed to determine if the Perth community uses goals, the characteristics of those goals and how those goals may be linked to behaviour. The survey indicated that most people were already using goals in their daily lives and the majority of people would respond positively to the use of goal setting in an environmental education program. Thus, a new environmental education framework was developed which included providing action knowledge, teaching goal setting skills, setting goals and providing continued feedback and support. The proposed environmental education framework was then implemented and evaluated through two environmental education programs, Green Houses and Living Smart.

The Green Houses program assessed the effectiveness of the framework for reducing household energy consumption and the effectiveness of different communication methods for delivering the framework. Personal communication through the workshop was the most effective method for changing behaviour, with workshop participants reducing their energy consumption by 17%. The website and booklet approach also had reductions in energy consumption (7% &amp; 8%, respectively). The schools group was the only group not to achieve a reduction, suggesting that what the students learnt about energy saving was not being transferred to the home environment or impacting on their parent&#146;s behaviour. The groups that set goals reduced their energy consumption by an additional 5% compared to the corresponding control groups and maintained those savings for a significantly longer period of time. 

The Living Smart program then assessed the effectiveness of the framework for creating behaviour change across a range of sustainability topics. As a result of the program, participants significantly increased both their environmental knowledge and sustainable behaviours. A control group that received the same environmental information as the Living Smart group, but no goal setting skills, only increased their environmental knowledge. This demonstrated that environmental information alone is not sufficient for changing behaviour. The qualitative evaluation identified that goal setting facilitated behaviour change in participants because it gave them direction and strategy and increased their motivation and commitment to changing their behaviour. Importantly, the goal setting process worked equally well across all the sustainability topics, suggesting that the tool works for a variety of behaviours, not just energy conservation.

In conclusion, the goal setting process and framework created effective behaviour change that was maintained longer than when goal setting is not used. The goal setting process and framework can be delivered effectively through a range of communication strategies and can be applied effectively to a range of environmental behaviours. Therefore, goal setting is an effective and valuable behaviour change tool that has great potential across a range of environmental education programs to create positive environmental outcomes in, for and about the environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goal setting</field><field name="subject">environmental education</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061101.85105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic Management Accounting and Managerial Decision-Making reconceptualised: towards a collaboratively oriented theory of organizational decision enhancement (ODE)</field><field name="creator">D.Holloway@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis critically assesses the literature on strategic management accounting that is budgeting and corporate governance and also the managerial decision-making literature (primarily in the areas of strategic planning and change management).  It is essentially a theory building and analytical thesis utilising a critical social science approach.  The main aim is the construction of a collaborative theory of decision-making and associated methodology that will underpin and explain a more &#145;robust&#146; construction of decision outcomes within an individual organizational context.
In doing so it evaluates and synthesises Habermas&#146;s theory of communicative action with the intention of incorporating key elements as well as insights from Latour, complexity theory and Peirce in relation to doubt-driven inquiry in a proposed collaboratively oriented theory of organizational decision enhancement (ODE).  ODE theory is argued to be widely applicable in the decision-making process utilised by organizations (private, public and non-profit).  The claims implicit within the theory and its associated decision-making methodology are assessed empirically at the strategic planning level.  This was part of an action research project commenced in July 2001 with Tertiary Institution&#146;s  current strategic planning round covering the planning time horizon 2003-2007.
ODE theory postulates that effective decision-making in a world of uncertainty is best undertaken in a practical and collaborative group process.  The theory, that I have derived, is stated as follows: 
Optimal decision-making which a particular group of decision makers can construct in a world of uncertainty and risk is a pragmatic, recursive and democratised process.  The process minimises the role of individual power, authority, self-interest and ego.  This collaborative approach focuses on the force of the &#145;better argument&#146;, utilises constructive conflict (CC) and continuous, conscious, collaborative adaptation (CCCA) and results in the selection and monitoring of a &#145;best-option&#146; decision outcome.
The theory minimises the role of power and authority, focuses on the Habermasian concept of the force of the &#145;better argument&#146;, maximises the utility of resistance to change and results in the selection of a &#145;best-alternative&#146; option that is subjected to a rigorous, performance measure-based monitoring feedback loop.  In so doing this thesis extends significantly the earlier extant literature on organizational decision-making.  It effectively revisits the notion of teams and groups in the organizational context and argues for organizations to seriously consider &#145;reengineering&#146; the decision-making methodology and approach to one that necessitates effective devolution and delegation of decision-making powers.  I argue that organizations should allow for and promote a &#145;cascade&#146; effect to let control, power, authority and collective responsibility filter down through the organizational layers.
Effectiveness and not efficiency (falsely perceived as timely) should be the aim of well-constructed decision outcomes.   The adaptability and self-organising capability of the workforce requires an inclusive, not exclusive, decision-making methodology to unlock and realise the full future potential of the organization.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational decision making</field><field name="subject">collaborative decision making</field><field name="subject">managerialism</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">followership</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061103.115423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The underwater acoustic repertoire of the long-necked, freshwater turtle Chelodina oblonga</field><field name="creator">turtle111@aapt.net.au</field><field name="description">The major question addressed by this project was to determine if the long-necked,
freshwater turtle Chelodina oblonga, vocalise underwater and whether their vocal activity could
be related to behavioural or ecological aspects of their lives. These turtles often live in
wetlands where visibility is restricted due to habitat complexity or light limitation caused by
factors such as tannin-staining, or turbidity. For many aquatic animals, sound is a useful
means of communication over distances beyond their visual acuity. This thesis gives the
first detailed account of the underwater vocal repertoire of C. oblonga.

In total, over 230 days were spent in the field and more than 500 hours of tape recordings
were made for this research. Initially, a number of recordings took place in three wetlands
known to support turtle populations: Blue Gum Lake; Glen Brook Dam; and Lake
Leschenaultia in Perth, Western Australia; in order to determine the nature of the
freshwater sound field and place turtle vocalisations into the context in which they were
vocalising. The wetlands differed in terms of degree of enrichment, substrate material, water
depth and habitat complexity. Recordings were made over a four-week period in the last
month of summer and the first week of autumn (Feb-Mar 2003). Invertebrate sweeps were
also taken over a two-week period at each recording site to determine if invertebrate
distributions were related to patterns of sonic activity. To determine the influence of wind
on ambient noise; recordings were undertaken on winter mornings (June-August, 2003) at
Blue Gum Lake and Glen Brook Dam at locations north, south, west and east for four
different wind speeds &#150; Beaufort Wind Scale (BWS) 0,1,2 &amp; 3.

There were seven distinctive calls recognised in the recordings. The frequency bandwidth
most utilised by organisms was between 3 kHz up to around 14 kHz, with the exception of the &#145;bird-like song&#146;; which extended from 500 Hz up to around 10 kHz. Blue Gum Lake
contained a more diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates than Lake
Leschenaultia and Glen Brook Dam. Correspondingly, a greater diversity of calls was
recorded at Blue Gum Lake, as well as the presence of chorus activity, which was not heard
at the two less-enriched sites. The periods of greatest diversity and abundance of
macroinvertebrates was synonymous with the increased sonic activity at dusk and midnight
with noise levels greatest at dusk in particular, and to a lesser extent at midnight. There was
no difference in ambient noise at Blue Gum Lake or Glen Brook Dam at wind speeds of
Beaufort Wind Scale 0, 1 and 2.

Turtles from three populations were recorded in artificial environments: consisting of
round, plastic, above-ground ponds (1.8m dia. x 0.65m depth), which were set up to recreate
small wetlands. Recordings occurred from September to October, 2003 and from
February to December, 2004 as well as January, 2005. Seven hatchling and five juvenile
turtles (CL &lt;10cm) were also recorded in order to ascertain whether very young turtles
vocalised. Hatchlings were recorded in a glass aquarium (35.5cm length x 20cm width x
22.0cm depth) and juveniles were placed into a below-ground outdoor pond (1m length x
0.5m width x 0.4m depth). Recordings occurred from as early as 4.30am (dawn recordings)
to as late as 1.30am (evening recordings).

The recordings revealed that turtles utilise an underwater acoustic communication system
(calling at the water&#146;s surface was also noted but these were not recorded or a part of this
research) involving a repertoire of both complex and percussive sounds with short, medium
and potentially long-range propagation characteristics. Complex structures included
harmonically related elements (richly or sparsely) and different rates of frequency
modulation. Frequency use extended beyond the in-air auditory sensitivity known for a
single species of turtle studied from the family Chelidae; with calls ranging from around 100
Hz in some of the percussive displays, to as high as 3.5 kHz in some complex calls, with
&#145;clicks&#146; extending beyond the 20 kHz upper limit of the recording system. However, most
of C. oblonga&#146;s vocalisations had dominant frequencies below 1 kHz. Turtles were
intermittent callers with an extensive vocal repertoire of seventeen (17) vocal categories -
highly suggestive of complex social organisation. Vocalisations included: a) clacks; b) clicks;
c) squawks; d) hoots; e) short chirps; f) high short chirps; g) medium chirps; h) long chirps;
i) high calls; j) cries or wails; k) cat whines; l) grunts; m) growls; n) blow bursts; o) staccatos;
p) a wild howl; and q) drum rolling. Also, two sustained &#145;pulse-bouts&#146; were recorded during
the breeding months, hypothesised to function as acoustic advertisement displays &#150; possibly
&#145;calling songs&#146;. Hatchling turtles were not heard to vocalise within the audible range. Only a
single complex vocalisation was heard produced by the juvenile turtles, with a number of
percussive calls.
Preliminary playback trials were conducted under free-field conditions and within an
artificial environment, which consisted of a below ground rectangular tank (2.4m length x
0.8m width x 0.6m deep). A number of turtle calls recorded in the artificial ponds were
selected for playback. A UW 30 speaker was used for broadcast of calls. The free-field
playbacks occurred at Mabel Talbot Lake and Blue Gum Lake during the months of April
and May, 2005. Playback using 14 seconds of an artificially constructed sequence from the
sustained &#145;pulse-bout&#146; occurred in the artificial channels. This sequence consisted of some
of the first phase pulses followed by a section of the &#145;vibrato&#146;.

The preliminary free-field playback trials indicated that turtles had some interest in the calls
being played by responding with an &#145;alert posture&#146;. Turtles were shown to remain in the
alert posture for a significantly longer time than when no sound was played or when white
noise was played. The extensive repertoire and initial responses to the free-field playbacks
indicated that sound has some biological importance for C. oblonga, although results of
playbacks under artificial conditions were inconclusive.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">turtles</field><field name="subject">vocalization</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">chelodina</field><field name="subject">animal communication</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061121.103729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the blink of an eye : an investigation into the concept of the 'decisive moment' (Augenblick) as found in nineteenth and twentieth century western philosophy</field><field name="creator">kward@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">&#145;In the blink of an eye&#146; is a figurative expression which, in its most basic interpretation describes the experience of a fleeting but momentous event.

It notes how nostalgia and the collective memory, together with a strong sense of place are reflected in celebrations which honour national and local historic characters and events, and observes the ways in which isolated rural towns reconcile their new tourist image with their pioneering past.   It will be argued that the concepts of nation and national identity are increasingly being challenged by the need for a social and cultural identity which belongs to the local community. A range of diverse cultures and heritage sites has been studied in order to analyse the dilemmas facing local, outback, and Indigenous communities in reconstructing a regional identity today. 

The Heritage Trail can be seen as a symbolic rite of passage, and this thesis is indeed a personal journey divided into two major components. First, it takes the form of documentary, a visual component consisting of three video films which capture the heritage tourism product along the Tropic of Capricorn. On the Western Line documents the author&#146;s journey on &#145;The Spirit of the Outback&#146; from the central coast to Winton and Kynuna, the home of Waltzing Matilda in far western Queensland. Two further historical productions The Legend of King O'Malley and The Triumph and Tragedy of Tommy Wills record local and national narratives, which both deliver a controversial picture of federation politics and pioneer settlement, colonial sport and frontier war, each focusing on a regional perspective within a wider national vision.

The second, written component reflects upon the role of the documentary maker in recording a social history of these diverse communities. It examines the auteur/director&#146;s own perceptions of regional identity, and the oppositions and ambiguities of reality are juxtaposed with legend and myth.  This essay explores the different layers of meaning inscribed within central images of cultural tourism such as: the Stockman&#146;s Hall of Fame at Longreach; the Australian Worker&#146;s Heritage Centre at Barcaldine; local museums at Mt. Morgan and Emu Park; the Dreamtime Cultural Centre; and the South Sea Islanders&#146; Sugar Trail. Following Bennett and Bourdieu&#146;s work on museum visitors, the author&#146;s preliminary survey of tourists seeking Capricornia&#146;s increasingly popular heritage destinations is discussed.   In conclusion, it can be argued that the rapid growth of Central Queensland&#146;s cultural centres, local museums, and bicentennially funded outdoor art and &#145;unusual&#146; monuments, has produced new sources of income in a community desperately seeking to survive.  The cultural tourist has become a major producer of the heritage industry which impacts strongly on regional identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Popular culture</field><field name="subject">Heritage tourism</field><field name="subject">Central Queensland's</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061121.145704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on polymorphic alu insertions and genomic diversity within the major histocompatibility complex</field><field name="creator">ddunn@cbbc.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">After the initiation of the human genome sequencing project and the introduction of the field of &#145;bioinformatics&#146;, interest in human genetic diversity studies has been increased. Sequence diversity has helped define differences between genes and genomic regions that were previously unknown or difficult to determine. In this thesis I have undertaken to study sequence diversity in the human genome in three areas; 1) investigated diversity in the MHC as represented by the MICA alleles with respect to the known HLA alleles, 2) investigated the structure and diversity in the intergenic region from an MHC related (paralogous) genomic region and related the structural and diversity findings to the knowledge available on the MHC and the wider genome, and 3) described the identification of three and characterization of five new MHC class I polymorphic markers (Alu) and their polymorphic characteristics in worldwide populations and their associations with skin cancer.
1.  Phylogenetic analysis of MICA alpha-domain (extracellular) sequences demonstrated relationships with HLA-B cross-reactive serogroups. The HLA-B and MICA loci are in linkage disequilibrium. The data indicated that MICA and HLA-B have evolved in concert from their common ancestors and that the transmembrane polymorphisms have arisen independently and more recently. 
2.  Sequence analysis of the CD1 genomic region confirmed the presence of five CD1 genes and revealed that there are four unrelated intergenic regions (IGRs). The IGRs are composed mostly of retroelements including five full-length L1 PA sequences and various pseudogenes. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses support the view that the human CD1 gene copies were duplicated prior to the evolution of primates and the bulk of the HLA class I genes found in humans. 
3.  Five polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) were identified (two from previous studies) and located within the 1.8 megabase of the MHC class I genomic region. All five POALINs are polymorphic, and are positively associated with the HLA-A and HLA-B alleles. The AluyHJ insertion was found most frequently associated with HLA-A1 or A24, AluyHG with HLA-A2, AluyHF with HLA-A2, A-10 or -A26 and AluyTF showed a marginal association with HLA-A29. The AluyMICB insertion was strongly associated with HLA-B17 (HLA-B57, HLA-B58) and HLA-B13. The presence of three Alu insertions (AluyHJ, AluyHG and AluyHF) was found in only one HLA class I haplotype (HLA-A1, -B57, -Cw6) in the 10th IHW cell lines. A novel positive association between the presence of AluyMICB and the &#145;MICAdel/MICBnull/HLA-B48&#146; haplotype was determined. The AluyMICB insertion was also associated with at least three different MICB alleles (*0102, *0107N and *0105) and three different HLA-B alleles (B13, B48 and B57). Based on the analysis of associations between different polymorphic markers within the beta block, the MICB*0102 allele was inferred to be the ancestral form of the MICB*0105 and MICB*0107N alleles. The AluyMICB polymorphism can be used to further investigate haplotype relationship and consequently their lineage origins. Some of the MHC POALINs are haplospecific and associate strongly with certain groups of HLA class I alleles and MHC ancestral haplotypes.  The AluyTF frequency was significantly associated with skin cancer (p&lt;0.005).  
MICA gene diversity is derived from two different evolving paths, therefore one or the other alone cannot reliably mark an ancestral haplotype.  The CD1 duplicons originated well before the HLA class I duplicons. The MHC POALINs provide new lineage and linkage markers for the fine mapping study of different haplotypes and variations in linkage groups across 1.8 Mb of the MHC class I region. The POALINs may also prove useful in investigating the origins and history of human populations and in determining the role of human genetic diversity in disease risk.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human genome</field><field name="subject">human gene mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061121.94752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology, ecology and taxonomy of Phytophthora citricola in native plant communities in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Felicity J Bunny</field><field name="description">The objectives of the project were to develop an understanding of the disease dynamics caused
by Phytophthora citricola in native plant communities in the south of Western Australia. Prior
to 1983, the pathogen had only been reported twice from Australian forests. Since then,
P. citricola has been extensively recorded from plant communities north and south of Perth, and
is currently the second most frequently recovered Phytophthora species from the northern jarrah
forest and the northern sandplains.
The objectives were addressed by examining the biology, ecology and taxonomy of
isolates of P. citricola local to the southwest. Examination of the intraspecific variation of
P. citricola by isozyme analysis resolved three major electrophoretic subgroups (SG), and these
were aligned with morphological and cultural variation within the species. One electrophoretic
SG was confined to forested areas. This SG differed from other SGs in sporangial dimensions,
growth rate on two media and in vitro sensitivity to phosphonate. A redescription of the species
may be warranted.
P. citricola was positively associated with two roads in the northern jarrah forest. Road
surfaces were sampled, then soil overburden was removed and the surface of the concreted
lateritic layer beneath was sampled. Isolation of P. citricola declined away from the road into the
adjacent forest and was more frequently recovered from the caprock (up to 1 metre below soil
surface) than from the soil surface. The most probable source of introduction was from infested
soil on vehicles using the roads.
Oospores were shown to be produced in two soils, a lateritic gravelly loam and sand,
and in plants. In soil, the electrophoretic SG confined to the forest (loamy soil) produced only
limited numbers of oospores in the sandy soil of the northern sandplain. The restriction of this
SG to the forested areas is probably physiological, rather than limited dispersal, with the SG
currently occupying the full extent of its range. Estimation of the relative persistence of
oospores, zoospores and plant material colonised by P. citricola established that only oospores
(either free in soil or in colonised plant material) were important in long tern survival in soil.
Oospores were still viable after six months at two field sites, and after 18 months in soil in the
laboratory.
Phosphonate is currently the most promising method of control of Phytophthora induced
disease in native plant cornmunites of the southwest. The efficacy of phosphonate against
P. citricola was examined in vivo and in vitro against two SGs. Phosphonate successfully
inhibited lesion growth of both SGs in vivo, but of only one electrophoretic subgroup in vitro.
The ecological implications of infestation of native plant communities in the southwest
of Australia are discussed.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jarrah dieback</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">phytophthora</field><field name="subject">citricola diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.122739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individual team and organizational learning:underpinnings of competitive advantage</field><field name="creator">Christopher Ching Ann Chan</field><field name="description">Many academicians and practitioners have recognized that organizational learning is a
viable paradigm for contemporary organizations aspiring to attain competitive
advantage in an increasingly turbulent business environment. Despite tremendous
interest in endeavoring to understand the nature of learning organizations, there is a
dearth of empirical evidence to support the anecdotal claims that learning in
organizations results in positive outcomes such as team performance, service quality,
job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Most studies either focus on the
antecedents and obstacles to learning or speculate how learning produces positive
outcomes. Consequently, the purpose of this research was to examine the interactions
of individual, team and organizational learning and to examine how learning at the three
levels contributed to competitive advantage. In the framework of this study competitive
advantage was conceptualized to be made up of team performance, service quality, job
satisfaction, and organizational commitment.
Accordingly, a cross-sectional study was conducted at a 230-bed capacity Australian
hospital. The study respondents were drawn from all fill time hospital workers -
nurses, executives, managers, professions allied to health, administration and clerical
workers. As the doctors are contracted, they were not surveyed. All respondents
completed a complex questionnaire. In addition to demographic information, the
instruments used in the questionnaire included the Individual Learning Scale (Arnes and
Archer, 1988), Team Learning Survey (Edrnondson, 1996), Organizational Learning Survey (Goh and Richards, 1997), Team Performance Survey (Edmondson, 1996),
SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, 1991), job satisfaction section of the
Job Diagnostic Survey (Hackman and Oldham, 1979, and Organizational Commitment
Questionnaire (Porter, Steers, Mowday, and Boulian, 1976). These instruments were
deliberately chosen because of their previously recorded acceptable psychometric
properties (i.e. validity and reliability) in similar assessments, and hence, they were
considered appropriate for the purpose of this study.
A comprehensive methodology was used to assess the hypotheses. Relevant literature
pertaining to the variables examined in this study was reviewed. In light of the
literature review, a number of hypotheses and a conceptual model were developed. A
quantitative methodology was used to test the proposed hypotheses and qualitative
information was sought to provide some explanation of the results. This pluralist
approach is gaining recognition in contemporary research because of the
complementary nature of qualitative to quantitative methodology (Edmondson, 1996;
Shaffer and Harrison, 2001). In total 700 questionnaires were administered for
completion during a period of two weeks. A total of 189 questionnaires were returned,
generating an overall response rate of 27.0 percent. The lower-than-expected response
rate was a concern, as biasness in results could occur (Churchill, 1991; Hunt, 1990), so
a non-response bias assessment was conducted by comparing early and late respondents
(Rulke, Zaheer, and Anderson, 2000; Wright, 1997). The results indicated no grave
problem with non-response bias, and therefore, the data was deemed suitable for
analyses.
Several statistical procedures were employed to evaluate the data. For example, factor
analyses and reliability analyses were used to assess the psychometric properties of the
scales. The results of psychometric assessments indicated that the scales had good
validities and reliabilities, and the data was robust. Then, path analysis was used to test
the hypotheses, which were developed in Chapter Two. The results of path analysis
indicated that individual learning was negatively related to team learning, two service
quality facets, and two organizational learning facets. Also, the predictions that team
learning would enhance organizational learning and team performance were fully
supported. Furthermore, the relationships between organizational learning and three
relevant outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and service quality)
received some support. Finally, it was found that three job satisfaction facets were
related to organizational commitment. Implications for these findings are
comprehensively discussed in the implications section of Chapter Five.
A feature of this study is the use of informal focus groups to improve the understanding
of statistical results. The Quality Coordinator of the hospital organized seven sessions
and every employee was invited to attend. Each session lasted fifteen to twenty
minutes. The Chief Executive Officer, who attended most the sessions, displayed
tremendous interest and support for the study. There were two objectives for the
informal discussions. Firstly, this strategy allowed a better interpretation of the results
from the mindsets of some employees. During the sessions, attendees were asked to
recall instances that support the findings. Secondly, the session allowed staff members
to discuss any job-related issues with the Quality Coordinator and Chief Executive Officer. Indeed, as suggested by contemporary management researchers (Bond, Fu, and
Pasa, 2001; de Ruyter, Moorman, and Lemrnink, 2001; Teagarden, Von Glinow,
Bowen, Frayne, Nason, Huo, Milliman, Arias, Butler, Geringer, Kim, Scullion, Lowe,
and Drost, 1995), this informal qualitative approach was complementary to the
statistical method.
The study represents an original attempt to empirically examine the individual, team
and organizational learning constructs and their outcomes. Discussion of results is
preceded by a review of the outcomes of individual learning, which include team
learning, organizational learning, and service quality. Next, the outcomes of team
learning, such as organizational learning, team performance and service quality, are
discussed. Subsequently, the effects of organizational learning on job satisfaction,
organizational commitment and service quality are discussed. The discussion is
concluded with explanations for the reciprocal relationship between the affective
variables of job satisfaction and organizational commitment as well as the effects of the
two variables on service quality. Following the discussion of results, the limitations and
strengths of the study are presented. Finally, suggestions for future research are
provided.
A number of theoretical and practical contributions have resulted from this study.
These can be broadly summarized to include four features. The first contribution of
this study is an advancement of the currently available knowledge about individual,
team and organizational learning by empirically examining the linkages. A second contribution of the study is an assessment of the appropriateness of the Individual
Learning Survey, Team Learning Survey, Organizational Learning Survey, and the
SERVQUAL instrument in assessing learning capabilities and service quality in the
context of an Australian hospital, with the potential of a wider application across the
health care industry. Next, evidence supporting the organizational learning facets that
have contributed to employee attitude and behavior, such as job satisfaction and
organizational commitment, may help bolster arguments for initiatives to improve the
quality of life of health care staff. Finally, identifying the organizational learning facets
that have contributed to service quality has the potential to encourage hospital
management to incorporate human resource policies into operational plans to improve
service quality. Implications of the findings for managers and theory developments are
discussed comprehensively in Chapter Five.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.124600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban rail perspectives in Perth, Western Australia : modal competition, public transport, and government policy in Perth since 1880</field><field name="creator">Peter Cole</field><field name="description">The decline of public transport in Western Australia is observed in four separate
historical studies which narrate the political and administrative history of each major
urban transport mode. Perth's suburban railway system is examined as part of the State's
widespread rail network, including the extravagantly-equipped short-lived suburban
railway in Kalgoorlie. Political interference in early railway operations is studied in
detail to determine why Perth's rail-based public transport systems were so poorly
developed and then neglected or abandoned for much of the twentieth century. The
llnique events in Kalgoorlie at the turn of the century are presented as potent reasons for
the early closure of Perth's urban tramway system and the fact that no purpose-built
suburban railways were constructed in Perth until 1993. The road funding arrangements
of the late nineteenth century are considered next, in order to demonstrate the very early
basis for the present lavish non-repayable grants of money for road construction and
maintenance by all three layers of government. The development of private and
government bus networks is detailed last, with particular attention paid to the failure of
private urban bus operators in the 1950s and the subsequent formation of a government
owned and operated urban bus monopoly. The capital structure and accounting
practices of public transport modes are analysed to provide a critique of popular myths
concerning the merits of each. In order to obtain an impression of the changing political
view of different transport modes, the attitude of politicians to public transport and the
private motor car over the last one hundred and twenty years is captured in summary
narrations of some of the more important parliamentary transport debates. Two possible
explanations of public transport decline are discussed in conclusion; one relying a neoclassical
economic theory of marginal pricing, and the other on an observation on the fate
of large capital investments in the modern party-based democratic system of
government.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transportation</field><field name="subject">Automotive</field><field name="subject">History Local transit</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.125641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The availability of international judicial review of government act for breaches of human rights</field><field name="creator">adt@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to provide description, analysis and criticism on
the existing international instruments for the promotion of respect and protection of
human rights, as well as a suggestion to the international community through the
United Nations mechanism to adopt an additional legal instrument as a
complementary procedure. This, in turn, should serve as an extra-pressure upon the
State governments to bring their internal legal system in the same line as the
international standards for the protection of human rights.

It is being argued in this work that the current international procedures available to
individual alleging their human rights have been abused by State are no longer
sufficient and therefore another procedure should be introduced and put into place.
The chapter "The Case of Indonesia" serves as a good (or bad?) example of State
abusive conduct and remain "untouchable" under international mechanisms.
Despite gross and systematic violations of human rights Indonesian government is
still immune due to executive-heavy legislation system, restricted judicial review as a
result of a corrupt judiciary and impunity of government and other public agencies.

The study fvstly concentrates on the procedures available at international level for
dealing with individual complaint alleging human rights violations. Different
procedures both under Charter and treaty provisions are analysed in the attempt to
describe their advantages and disadvantages. Two Charter-based procedures dealt
with in the discussion cover the communication procedure under the United Nations
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) which includes the "1503" procedure.
Treaty-based procedures are given special attention in this thesis which include the
procedure before the Human Rights Committee (HRC), the Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the Committee against Torture
(CAT) and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW).

The discussion further presents a critical appraisal of those procedures in which the
limitations and weaknesses of the procedures are analysed followed by the suggestion 
to adopt an additional procedure to complement the current mechanisms available 
to individual seeking remedies for human rights violations. The limitations
of the procedures featured largely by the fact that the decisions resulted from those
procedures are legally non-binding. And this all what an individual can receive after
being allowed to bring hisher petition before the Committee. Before one is
permitted to communicate with one of the Committee hetshe must first meet all the
conditions of admissibility. The condition "exhaustion of all domestic remedies" can
virtually be seen as a hindrance for individual to communicate with the Committee.
Jn order to support this argument several decisions on several individual complaints
handed down by the HRC are presented in this study.

Finally, the study introduces a complementary procedure called International
Judicial Review by which the State Constitutions and legislation can be examined
whether or not they are in conformity with international human rights standards
and norms. If found inconsistent the Constitutions or legislation must be declared
invalid. The power to review is given to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as
the "principal judicial organ of The United Nations". And as a World Court the
decision made by the ICJ has legally binding power.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="subject">Judicial review</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.131327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge production and transfer in physical and life sciences</field><field name="creator">Daniela Nicolau</field><field name="description">Questions about knowledge flows between different fields of science are important &amp;om
a policy perspective.
This thesis focuses on knowledge transfer between physical sciences and life sciences.
Science and technology are increasingly intemvined in a complex continuum. This
complexity of the science and technology today asks for a concerted, articulated and
comprehensive understanding of the process of science and technology.
The approach that this research has taken is to analyse the process of science and
technology. The thesis asks: What is the trade of science and technologv? In order to
answer this question we developed an anatomy of knowledge and we analysed the
internal developments in science via the analysis of the role of the researchers as carriers
and producers of knowledge.

Secondly the thesis asks: What are the mechanisms and directions on which scientzjic
knowledge migrates? This research postulates that the analysis of the process of science
and technology translates to the analysis of the production and transfer of scientific and
technological knowledge.
What is obvious and essential for science and technology is the difference between the
specific mechanisms of knowledge production. This thesis suggests that the modem
mode of knowledge production is characterized by an increasing density of
communication on three levels: between science and technology - on one hand - and
society on the other-; between scientific practitioners; and with the entities of the physical and social world. Central to our research is the concept of 'mode of knowledge
production ' with mode 1 and mode 2 being defined by Gibbons.

The four case studies employed emphasise on how collaboration across disciplines is
highly important for the production of new knowledge. The main characteristic of newly
emerging fields in an increasing synergy between disciplines, which leads to several
types of communication between them.
With the increasing of the interdisciplinary intensity the border between the production of
knowledge and the transfer of knowledge begins to be blurred. The transfer of knowledge
occurs today at a more conceptual level. It follows that the production of knowledge has a
large .component of knowledge transfer. To study it, ths thesis proposes a quasiquantitative
model. In h s unified &amp;mework for the knowledge tmnsfer mechanisms,
transfer is seen as a process with a number of stages and forms. We tested our framework
on four case studies.

The third part of the thesis proposes a taxonomy of interdsciplinarity. and deals with the
social engineering of knowledge transfer that is the design of adequate guidelines for
policies aiming at maximization of knowledge transfer. In this way the thesis aims to
contribute to the understanding of processes of development of new emerging scientific
fields.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.141122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomy of a traffic disaster : towards a sustainable solution to Bangkok's transport problems</field><field name="creator">adt@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Bangkok's extreme traffic problems have been traditionally explained in terms of a lack
of road infrastructure and policy responses for many years have almost exclusively
stressed road investment to the exclusion of all other forms of transport infrastructure
development. This thesis questions this interpretation of the traffic problem and its
chief policy response: building still more roads. It suggests that in order to effectively
analyse Bangkok's traffic predicament and to formulate more sustainable responses to
the crisis, an understanding is required of Bangkok's land use and transport
development, as well as a systematic and detailed perspective on the similarities and
differences between Bangkok and many other cities around the world, particularly
those in Asia.

This thesis suggests that Bangkok has passed through three key periods: a water-based
transport and walking period, a transport modernisation period and a motorisation
period. In each period up to motorisation Bangkok appeared to maintain a harmonious
relationship between its high density, mixed use urban form, ideally suited to nonmotorised
modes and to public transport. Even in the motorisation period, high
density, mixed use development has mostly followed major road corridors and
remains well-suited to much higher public transport and non-motorised mode use than
currently exist. However, in this period, rapidly rising motor vehicle ownership and use
began to come into conflict with the city's pre-automobile form. Road infrastructure
could not be built fast enough to keep pace with traffic growth, despite almost
exclusive commitment of resources to roads. High capacity public transport systems,
including rail, renewed water transport and busways failed to materialise to help curb
the motorisation process and to provide much needed relief on the roads. A basic
conflict or mismatch between urban form and transport began to emerge, leaving the
city ill-equipped to cope with the automobile and subject to large environmental, social
and economic impacts from congestion.

The thesis argues that while Bangkok's per capita road supply is low in an
international sense, it is not atypical for an Asian city and road availability per hectare
is similar to many other cities around the world. Likewise, common arguments about
an inadequate road hierarchy are systematically analysed and are shown to be
insufficient in explaining Bangkok's present crisis. The thesis thus suggests that
attempting to tackle the traffic problem through an intensification of road building
efforts will not provide the relief sought, but will only exacerbate the traffic impacts
which are shown to be already at the limits of international experience.

The international comparison of Bangkok with other cities, highlighting basic
similarities and differences in land use and transport features, continues to build upon
this argument. It shows that Bangkok lies at one extreme in many transport
characteristics such as the amount of travel per hectare, and within the Asian cities, it
is very high in vehicle ownership and use and energy use, comparatively low in public
transport use and very low in non-motorised modes. The thesis suggests that in
physical planning terms, Bangkok's traffic crisis appears to stem from a set of
mismatches between its transport patterns, urban form and transport infrastructure.
These mismatches are between: (1) vehicle use and urban form: higher levels of private
vehicle use than can be properly accommodated in its dense, tightly woven urban
fabric; (2) vehicle use and road supply: levels of private vehicle use which are
incompatible with its road availability and which are uncharacteristically high
compared to other Asian cities; (3) transit use, urban form and road supply: lower
levels of overall transit use than would be expected in a city of its urban form and road
availability; (4) transit infrastructure, urban form and road supply: a public transport
infrastructure which is inadequate to meet the demands for transit movement inherent
in such a dense city, particularly a lack of rail infrastructure; (5) non-motorised modes
and urban form: levels of non-motorised mode use which are uncharacteristically low
for such a dense, mixed use urban fabric. These mismatches are mainly the consequence
of a long series of inappropriate and ineffective transport policies and investments
which are biased towards private transport and which have at least in part arisen
from narrow and outdated transport planning processes.

In order for transport planning in Bangkok to address the suggested roots of the crisis,
the thesis contends that at least two key constraints would have to be dealt with: the
traditional urban transport planning process and the institutional fragmentation in
transport policy and implementation. Notwithstanding, there are forces pushing in the
direction of change and these are examined in terms of the growing global and local
trends towards sustainability, community outrage over traffic and the role of NGOs.

Based on these findings, this thesis provides a case for a series of policies to help deal
with Bangkok's traffic disaster. In line with global trends towards sustainability as an
organising principle for urban policy development, these policies are offered within a
framework of developing a more sustainable transport system in Bangkok. The policies
suggested cover priority to public transport infrastructure development, transitoriented,
mixed land use development, transport demand management, improvement
of waterway transportation, facilitation of walking and cycling and institutional
reform of Bangkok's transport decision making structure. Opportunities for further
complementary research are suggested.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic safety</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Bangkok</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.142856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The colonization of prime time : soaps and the question of pleasure</field><field name="creator">adt@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The Colonization of Prime Time: Soaps and the Question of Pleasure
analyzes the conversations o f adult and teenage fans o f Australian,
British and American soap operas in order to understand how fans may
deal with ideological constructions with in their fanship networks,
particularly with dominant notions of femininity and the family . Like
women's domestic labor which is invisible in economic statistics , soap
opera audiences have been similarly invisible or marginalized and
stigmatized in dominant discourse by virtue of the fact  that they watch
soap operas. These fans, however, exist as par t of a secondary oral
culture which exists among women. Soaps texts are highly influenced by
the oral characteristics of this culture . In addition to clarifying
the oral characteristics o f soaps, I have theorized that when feminine
subjects, in this case soap opera fans, understand their subordinate
position with in a society and speak t o each other with this type of
knowledge, they are speaking what I have called feminine discourse.

The discursive position involved establishes boundaries for
women's oral culture and legitimizes the experience of women as soap
fans. In the marginalized discourse o f soap opera fanship, part of the
pleasure which fans experience in watching and talking about soaps is
the affirmation of their subjectivity , even though their position in
society is subordinate. Another aspect o f pleasure in soap opera
fanship is the mutual strengthening which comes from the power of talk
outside of the control o f dominant discourses. In addition, gossip
among women has the potential for keeping women from being politically isolated, 
giving them space and time to talk with each other without
the constraints imposed by dominant culture. While soaps knowledge
marks the boundaries of this aspect of women's culture, laughter and
irony seem to place these women in some ways outside of dominant
discourse. Although feminine soap opera audiences are structured by
the producers as consumers in and for the home and the patriarchal
family, in these interviews they negotiate spaces for their own
critical interpretations of patriarchical conventions.

The private discourse of soap opera audienceness in which these
viewers of soap operas engage is further negotiated in this work with
the public discourses about soap opera audiences which struggle to
contain the meanings of femaleness within patriarchical culture. What
I call the ideology of dependence works discursively on multiple levels
to assure that women and girls conform to dominant notions of feminity
in order to live comfortably in a world that is full of contradictions
for women. Multiple cultural discourses reinforce the expected codes
of behavior, but particular sites provide spaces where discursive
containment leaks through narrative seams. This happens in soap opera
texts and soap opera fanship networks partially because of the
impossibility of fully containing orality. This dissertation examines
both public and private, academic and less formal, written and oral
discourses for evidence of discursive ruptures where meaning evades
containment.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061122.154001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy and mechanisms of action of EMDR as a treatment for PTSD.</field><field name="creator">chris.lee@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The first aim of this thesis was to describe the characteristics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and to elucidate its place as a symptom disorder that sometimes develops when people are exposed to a traumatic event.  The current major theoretical approaches to account for why some people who are exposed to trauma develop PTSD and the mechanisms by which this occurs were described.  Three classes of theories were reviewed: conditioning/learning approach; information processing theories with a particular focus on the meaning of the trauma event; and biological models with an emphasis on recent neurocircuitry and neurochemistry models.  

Successful treatment approaches were then reviewed which indicated two major contenders for the most efficacious treatment for PTSD:  traditional cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) using either stress inoculation or prolonged exposure; and eye movement desensitisation and processing (EMDR).  Prior to the first study (Lee, Gavriel, Drummond, Richards, &amp; Greenwald, 2002), a review of the literature indicated equivalent effects for EMDR and CBT.  There had been very few direct comparison studies and each had serious methodological flaws, particularly with respect to random assignment and treatment fidelity. Therefore, the first study ensured adequate attention to these areas and involved a direct comparison between the two procedures using a sample of 24 participants diagnosed with PTSD. EMDR and stress inoculation training with prolonged exposure were found to lead to similar symptom improvement at the end of treatment, apart from a slight advantage for EMDR on intrusion symptoms. Both treatments led to significantly greater symptom reduction than a wait list control condition.   At follow-up, EMDR led to greater gains on both self-report and observer rated measures of PTSD and self-report measures of depression.   Overall, the findings were similar to those described in previously published studies, with a suggestion that EMDR was slightly more efficient than the standard CBT approach.  

Given that the evidence suggested that EMDR was a more efficient treatment, it became critical to understand the underlying processes.  A process study was undertaken that examined the responses of people with PTSD receiving EMDR treatment (Lee, Taylor, and Drummond, 2006). Guided by process studies of other treatments and theories that might account for why EMDR is effective, participants&#146; responses were examined to see which models better accounted for symptom improvement.  The main analysis tested whether or not the responses were consistent with processes that occurred during traditional CBT treatment, which prior research had identified as reliving, or whether they were more consistent with Shapiro&#146;s proposal that enhanced information processing occurs because there is a dual focus of attention (that is, the person simultaneously focuses on an external stimulus and on the traumatic memory) (Shapiro, 1995).  The responses made by 44 participants were coded by an independent rater according to whether they were primarily reliving, distancing, affect or material other than the primary trauma.  The coding system was found to have satisfactory inter-rater reliability.  Greatest improvement occurred when the participant processed in a more detached or distant manner, whereas reliving responses were not associated with improvement.  Cross-lagged panel correlations suggested that processing in a more detached manner was a consequence of the EMDR procedure rather than a measure that co-varied with improvement.  The findings underscored a difference in the processes that underlie EMDR and traditional CBT.

The major question left unanswered from this second study was what causes this distancing process?   Competing views were that it was facilitated by eye movement; alternatively, the therapist&#146;s instructions to participants might have precipitated this distancing phenomenon.  The third study tested these ideas by randomly assigning 48 participants to either an eye movement or a no eye movement condition under two types of therapist instructions (reliving or distancing).  Participants recalled personal distressing memories, and measures of distress and vividness were taken after treatment and at follow up.  Only the eye movements made a significant difference to people&#146;s level of distress.  
This conclusion appeared at odds with some of the previous literature that had tested the effects of eye movement on levels of distress.  A meta-analysis of some of this research had suggested that there was no significant advantage of including eye movement in EMDR treatment unless the person had been diagnosed with PTSD.  However, a close examination of this meta-analysis indicated some major methodological flaws in the computation; therefore, this was recalculated. The conclusion from this fourth study was consistent with study three in that EMDR with eye movement was found to lead to significantly greater improvement that EMDR without eye movement.  

The results of these four studies were then discussed in terms of their implications for the theoretical models presented in Chapter 1. Aspects of learning theory that might account for EMDR efficiency were discussed as well as the failure of this model to account for treatment gains following EMDR.  Information processing models were seen to better account for some of the phenomena observed in EMDR and for the findings from the four studies.  Some suggestions of how eye movements might facilitate improved information processing were presented.

Finally, the relative merits of EMDR and CBT treatments were discussed and suggestions made for when to combine approaches.  The conclusions highlight the point that EMDR appears to be the most promising treatment for PTSD.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">EMDR</field><field name="subject">PTSD</field><field name="subject">eye movement</field><field name="subject">exposure</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061123.120536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age composition and growth rates of selected fish species in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">bwise@fish.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Growth typically varies considerably amongst the individuals in a population and between individuals in different populations of the same species, especially when those populations are found in environments in which the characteristics differ markedly. Although the annuli in hard structures are often used to age fish, such growth zones are not always clearly defined in these structures. Thus, in these cases, it is necessary to use alternative methods for ageing, such as analysis of modal progressions in length-frequency data. However, these types of techniques can usually only identify distinct size classes that correspond to an age class. They thus only enable an individual fish to be aged when it is a member of a discrete size cohort. Such a situation generally only applies to the younger age classes. This thesis reports the results of studies on a species that can be aged using the annuli in one of its hard parts (asteriscus otoliths), i.e. Cnidoglanis macrocephalus, and four species (Amniataba caudavitatta, Apogon rueppellii, Pseudogobius olorum and Favionigobius lateralis) for which it was necessary to use a method such as length-frequency analysis for ageing.

Cnidoglanis macrocephalus is an important recreational and commercial species caught in coastal marine and estuarine environments in south-western Australia. However, all previous detailed studies on the age and growth on this species have focused on estuarine populations. This thesis reports the results of a study of the biology of C. macrocephalus in Princess Royal Harbour, a marine embayment on the south coast of Western Australia. Samples of C. macrocephalus were collected from amongst the macroalgae that were removed from this highly eutrophic embayment by mechanical harvesters. Analysis of the reproductive and size composition data derived from these catches showed that spawning occurs between October and December and that fecundity ranged from 75 in a 384 mm fish to 465 in a 443 mm fish. Small fish (&lt;200 mm) were rarely caught, reflecting the fact that the young of this species are difficult to capture. 

Analysis of the trends exhibited by the marginal increments on otoliths showed that the number of annuli on this hard structure could be used to age C. macrocephalus. The samples of C. macrocephalus collected from Princess Royal Harbour contained female and male fish that had lived for up to 10 and 9 years in age and reached maximum lengths and weights of 523 mm and 745.3 g and 557 mm and 735.8 g, respectively. To overcome the paucity of small fish, von Bertalanffy growth curves were constructed using back-calculated lengths and employing the scale proportional hypothesis and body proportional hypothesis (see Francis 1990). The growth rates of females and males were slower than those in a nearby seasonally closed estuary (Wilson Inlet) and in a permanently open estuary on the lower west coast of Australia (Swan River Estuary). Yield per recruit analyses were conducted in order to ascertain what minimum legal lengths were appropriate for the capture of C. macrocephalus in Princess Royal Harbour, the Swan River Estuary and Wilson Inlet in order to sustain the stocks in those water bodies.

The age and growth of Amniataba caudavittata and Apogon rueppellii in the Swan River Estuary were determined by analysing the trends exhibited by modes in sequential monthly length-frequency data. This was achieved by employing MULTIFAN, which constrained the means of the lengths of the cohorts in successive monthly samples to a seasonal form of the von Bertalanffy growth curve. The resulting growth parameters derived by MULTIFAN were similar to those derived from the growth curves fitted to the means of the cohorts determined independently for each monthly sample by MIX. 

The discreteness of the distributions and modes of size classes in length-frequency data for A. caudavittata and A. rueppellii enabled sound growth curves to be constructed for both of these species. The growth curves of these two sexes of both species were significantly different, with K being lower and L&#61605; being higher for females. The trends exhibited by these growth curves emphasised that the growth of both species is highly seasonal, with little or no increase in length occurring during the cooler part of the year. The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth equations implied that &#147;negative growth&#148; occurred in winter, but this is an artefact produced by size-related differences in offshore movements that occur at that time of the year. 

The age and growth of two further species from the Swan River Estuary, Pseudogobius olorum and Favonigobius lateralis, were also studied.  Since P. olorum and F. lateralis both spawn at different times of the year and these times (spring and autumn) are not regularly spaced during the year, they produce new 0+ recruits at two irregularly-spaced times of the year. Consequently, MUTLIFAN cannot be used to analyse the size-distribution data for these two gobiid species. Thus, MIX was used to identify the size classes present in sequential samples and to provide means for the length distributions of those size classes. von Bertalanffy growth equations were then fitted to the mean lengths at the inferred age of the males and females of each size class of each species. It was found appropriate to use the traditional von Bertalanffy growth curve for describing the growth of the product of the spring-spawning group of both species and a seasonal von Bertalanffy growth curve for that of the product of the autumn-spawning groups of both species.

The growth curves, when considered in conjunction with the trends exhibited by reproductive variables, demonstrate that female F. lateralis attains sexual maturity more rapidly and at a larger size than P. olorum. The majority of the female and male progeny of the summer and autumn-spawning groups of F. lateralis reach maturity when they are approximately 3&#189; and 8&#189; months old, respectively, compared with five and seven months old, respectively, for P. olorum.

Models, incorporating data on water temperature and salinity and the growth and reproduction characteristics of P. olorum and F. lateralis, were used to postulate how environmental factors might be regulating when these two gobiid species spawn. The results of these models support the conclusion that the bimodal timing of spawning of P. olorum in the upper estuary was regulated by water temperature, with spawning occurring between 20 and 25oC but inhibited by temperatures greater than 25oC. They also showed that, although water temperature also influenced the timing of spawning of F. lateralis in the lower estuary, the onset of spawning by this species only occurred when salinities had reached 300/00.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061123.120638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chinese Combat Film Since 1949: Variants of 'Regulation', 'Reform' and 'Renewal'</field><field name="creator">M.Stein@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines variations of the Chinese &#145;combat film&#146;, from its origins within cinema in 1949, through to the contemporary period. My argument transposes the critical approach of &#145;genre&#146;, as a popular style within conventional film criticism, to a specific Chinese form. In particular, this study investigates the &#145;combat film&#146; as a prevailing mode in Chinese cinema, with a particular history, form of progression and set of aesthetics.   

The argument initially applies the &#145;war film&#146; and &#145;combat genre&#146; categorisations to Chinese forms. Consequently three major variants emerge, manifest in the &#145;regulated&#146; (1949-1966), &#145;reformed&#146; (1980s) and &#145;renewed&#146; (1990s) styles, respectively. These modes are subsequently examined in rigorous narratological and cinematic contexts, resulting in an expanded conception of the Chinese &#145;combat&#146; film.   

This thesis offers an integrative appreciation of variegations of the Chinese &#145;combat film&#146; since 1949, sutured to wider discursive and socio-political changes within the country. Moreover, this argument produces a framework for a more expansive and complex comprehension of Chinese cinema, one undergoing continual modes of re-negotiation as the medium progresses into the Twenty First Century.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motion pictures China</field><field name="subject">film genre</field><field name="subject">media China</field><field name="subject">culture China</field><field name="subject">combat films</field><field name="subject">social and cultural change China</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061123.141154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You Look Normal To Me:The Social Construction of Disability in Australian National Cinema in the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Katie.Ellis@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the social construction of disability in Australian national
cinema throughout the 1990s. During that decade, disability was an issue that
remained in the background of many film narratives and is (still) under-theorised
in academic scholarship. Disability continues to be tangential to many social
critiques, particularly in relation to cultural diversity and national identity. When
it is foregrounded, as in Liz Ferrier&#146;s (2001) work, its theoretical premise is
chiefly located in a damaged body, rather than examined through the lens of
cultural construction.
The growing number of culturally diverse filmmakers in the Australian film
industry during the 1990s initiated a critical focus on diversity, multiculturalism
and minority group interests. However, an examination of the social construction
of disability is conspicuously absent. I argue that a disability identity that
focuses attention away from the body and onto society should be incorporated
into notions of diversity concerning Australian national cinema.
In this thesis I investigate both thematic and stylistic representations of disability
with reference to socio-political contexts and influences. A disability identity &#151;
as it is included or excluded from Australian national identity &#151; is explored
through a variety of close readings of local films. I examine the methods
filmmakers employ to problematise diversity in relation to the limitations of
dominant representations of disability.
This thesis recognises the historical lack of scholarship in relation to disability as
a diversity issue in Australian national cinema of the 1990s and is an attempt to
open up this field to new modes of criticism.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">australian cinema</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061123.144826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Seagrass Photosynthesis Using Pulse Amplitude Modulated (Pam) Fluorometry and its Practical Applications, Specifically in Regard to Transplantation</field><field name="creator">L.Horn@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Photosynthetic activity of three seagrass species, Posidonia sinuosa Cambridge et Kuo,
Posidonia australis Hook. f. and Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook., growing in Cockburn
Sound, Western Australia, was assessed using an underwater pulse amplitude modulated
fluorometer (Diving-PAM). The study aimed to determine possible causes and the
extent of stress to seagrasses during transplantation, so that rehabilitation efforts can be
improved by reducing stress during the transplant process.

Absorptance factors for each species were determined as 0.64 &#177; 0.04 for P. sinuosa,
0.59 &#177; 0.02 for P. australis and 0.55 &#177; 0.02 for H. ovalis, which were substantially
lower than previously reported photosynthetic absorption factors. Transmittance,
reflectance and non-photosynthetic absorptance of light diverted between 35-45% of
irradiance from use in photosynthesis. An investigation of potential errors during
measurement of rapid light curves (RLCs) reinforced the importance of ensuring that
leaves remained stationary in the Universal Sample Holder. Any movement of seagrass
leaves resulted in incorrect measurements of electron transport rates (ETR).

A study on seasonal photosynthetic rates of each species found that maximum ETR
(ETRmax) varied seasonally and among species. The highest ETRmax for each species
occurred during summer, when ambient irradiances were at a maximum, and decreased
during autumn. H. ovalis had the highest overall ETRmax in summer, followed by
P. australis and P. sinuosa. Effective quantum yield(&#916;F/Fm&#8242;)of each species varied
seasonally, changing inversely with irradiance, which agrees with previously reported
studies. ETRmax for each species also showed a diurnal pattern coincident with
irradiance throughout the day. The &#196;F/Fm for all species demonstrated a diurnal
decrease in photosynthetic efficiency coincident with the midday irradiance maximum.
Large natural variation in ETR was detected in all species, indicating that the effects of
external stress on ETR may be difficult to detect.

Two adjacent, physically separated seagrass meadows were examined to determine if
apparent visual differences between the sites were reflected by measured physical and
photosynthetic characteristics. ETR, leaf area index and sediment grain size differed
between sites, but &#916;F/Fm, canopy height, shoot density and epiphyte biomass did not,
indicating a poor connection between physical and photosynthetic characteristics at
these two meadows. Therefore caution should be used when attempting to visually
assess the photosynthetic activity of a site based on physical characteristics.

Changes in photosynthetic activity were monitored to determine seagrass stress during
transplantation, and post-transplantation recovery. Two transplantation methods, sprigs
and plugs, were examined, and photosynthetic activity was compared before, during and
after transplantation. ETRmax of sprigs took one to two months to increase to the same
level recorded at a control meadow, primarily due to desiccation stress suffered during
transport. The &#916;F/Fm&#8242; decreased below 0.2 after transplantation, but fully recovered
after three months. Survival of sprigs was reduced due to strong currents and heavy
epiphytic fouling. The ETRmax of transplanted plugs (5, 10 and 15 cm diameter) took up
to one week to recover to the same level recorded at a control meadow. Survival of
plugs was reduced due to winter swells and storms. Since the leading human-controlled
cause of transplant failure was desiccation stress, future transplanting efforts should
endeavour to keep seagrasses submerged at all times during the transplanting process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">transplantation</field><field name="subject">Diving-PAM</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061123.150231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation</field><field name="creator">thompsona@missionaustralia.com.au</field><field name="description">This study has examined the knowledge required for the publication of an
Entrepreneurship and Business Innovation (E&amp;BI) focused teaching text. The
research design was based on a constructivist, interpretive paradigm, and
utilised a qualitative methodology to support the development of a framework
and content for a text. Data collection occurred through formal research,
discovery and exploration of knowledge rather than verification, and was subject
to my interpretation arising from my participation as an academic.

The analysis of data required a conceptual framework to be developed
consistent with the research paradigm, and be so designed as to provide a way
for me through a participatory process, to identify and evaluate knowledge in
E&amp;BI and investigate the research questions. The study rationalised that E&amp;BI
educational programs must first be consistent with, and reflective of, the mission
of the institution providing such programs, and also, must address the learning
needs of students. Previous research undertaken for this thesis had clearly
identified a strong demand for material on E&amp;BI that combined theory and
practice with case studies drawn from real world entrepreneurial practices.

The outcome of this study resulted in the design of a formal text that was
suitable for use by secondary, community and adult education institutions within
Australia, for delivery to both a digital and print audience and representative of
international E&amp;BI good practice. The text &#147;Entrepreneurship and Business
Innovation&#148; was published in 2005.

The published text was designed to provide new entrepreneurs and existing
Small to Medium Enterprise owners with a practical guide on how to pursue
business success based on established entrepreneurial and enterprise
management techniques. The thesis has explicated the scholarly coherence and
originality of the published work, and further places the text within a pedagogical

A total of 502 elasmobranchs representing 36 species, in addition to 1531 teleosts representing 46 species, were captured. In regard to elasmobranch species known to frequent riverine habitats, the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas was captured in the highest number, followed by the freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon, the freshwater whipray Himantura chaophraya and the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata. Although these species were generally captured in low numbers, all were widely distributed throughout the region. Furthermore, the waters of King Sound, Western Australia, and the rivers entering it, i.e. the Fitzroy, May and Robinson rivers, were found to contain far higher numbers of P. microdon and P. clavata than any of the other rivers sampled, as well as the northern river shark Glyphis sp. C, and which subsequently provided an ideal locality to study the biology of these species.

The Fitzroy River was shown to act as a nursery for P. microdon and P. clavata, where immature individuals remain for a maximum of four or five years before migrating to marine waters. Investigations of the rostra and rostral tooth morphology of P. microdon indicated their usefulness as a diagnostic tool in differentiating this species from other members of the genus, including P. clavata, and for differentiating between the sexes, i.e. female P. microdon generally possess 17-21 teeth cf. 19-23 teeth in males. However, no significant difference in the number of rostral teeth was found between female and male P. clavata, with both sexes possessing an average of 42. Furthermore, the facts that P. clavata was captured up to 2332 mm in total length and all of the individuals were immature, indicates that the description of this species as a &#145;dwarf&#146; sawfish is erroneous.

The use of rivers of northern Australia as nurseries was also apparent for C. leucas, with none of the 111 individuals dissected (ranging in length from 681 to 1365 mm TL) being mature. Furthermore, this species appeared to remain within the rivers for approximately four years. Stomach content analysis and field observations confirmed an opportunistic, and often aggressive, feeding nature, and thus the species may pose some risk to bathers utilising inland waters far upstream (i.e. over 300 km).

Morphometrics and radiographs of 10 Glyphis sp. C captured from the macrotidal waters of King Sound (the first capture of this species in Western Australia) indicated that these specimens possessed both a wider range in total vertebral count (i.e. 140-151 cf. 147-148) and number of diplospondylous caudal centra (i.e. 64-70 cf. 65-68) than that previously reported and lent support for its synonymisation with Glyphis gangeticus. Radiographs also revealed the spinal deformation and fusing of vertebrae in three of the ten individuals, which may be attributable to a genetic abnormality indicative of inbreeding within a small gene pool.

Analyses of stomach content and stable carbon (&#228;13C) and nitrogen (&#228;15N) isotope ratios of fishes occurring in the Fitzroy River indicated that the diets of a majority of the species present are broad, and greatly influenced by the seasonal availability of different prey types. While stomach content analysis suggested that aquatic insects, and to a lesser extent filamentous algae, represent vitally important food sources for many of the species present, stable isotope analysis strongly suggested that this latter food source may not be an important direct energy source, and that prey types which persist throughout the year (e.g. fish, molluscs and Macrobrachium rosenbergii) may in fact be more important sources of the energy than dietary data revealed. Dietary overlap was found to be the highest during the wet season when prey availability was high, decreased in the early dry season as fishes became more specialised in their feeding, before increasing again in the late wet when food became very limited. These analyses also supported the views that juvenile fishes may target high energy food items to attain higher growth rates and a large size rapidly, in order to achieve competitive feeding advantages and reduce the risk of predation, and that many species will maximise their energy intake in response to changes in resource availability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elasmobranch</field><field name="subject">sawfish</field><field name="subject">glyphis</field><field name="subject">stable isotype</field><field name="subject">fish</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.105505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Larval fish assemblages in coastal, shelf and offshore waters of south-western Australia.</field><field name="creator">barb.muhling@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Larval fish assemblages were investigated during a three-year multidisciplinary project conducted off the coast of south-western Australia. Larvae were sampled using replicated oblique bongo net tows along a five-station transect extending from inshore (18m depth) to offshore waters (1000m depth). A total of 148 taxa from 93 teleost families were identified. Larvae of Gobiidae, and Blenniidae were abundant inshore, while larvae of pelagic and reef-dwelling families, such as Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Carangidae and Labridae were common in continental shelf waters. Larvae of oceanic families, particularly Myctophidae, Phosichthydae and Gonostomatidae, dominated offshore assemblages. Inshore larval fish assemblages were the most seasonal, in terms of species composition and abundance, with offshore
assemblages the least so. 

Multivariate statistical analyses revealed larval fish assemblages to have a strong temporal and spatial structure. Assemblages were closely correlated to water masses, with species distributions reflecting both cross shelf and along-shore oceanographic processes and events. The strength and position of the warm, southward flowing Leeuwin Current, and of the cool, seasonal, northward flowing Capes Current were shown to drive much of the variability in the marine environment, and thus larval fish assemblages.

Many of the distinctions between larval fish assemblages on the continental shelf were attributable to patterns of abundance in clupeiform larvae. While larvae of Engraulis australis and Spratelloides robustus showed clear seasonal and spatial distribution patterns, larvae of Sardinops sagax and Etrumeus teres were found throughout the year, with high interannual variability in abundance. Abundances of larvae from all pelagic clupeiform species were negatively correlated to microzooplankton concentrations. Peaks of abundance of S. sagax and E. teres, in particular, appeared to be better aligned with favourable transport and retention conditions. 

A detailed comparison of the horizontal and vertical distribution of larval fishes highlighted the influence of contrasting oceanographic conditions between summer and winter on larval fish assemblages. Although most fish larvae were found above the thermocline, depth distributions differed between taxa, and were shown to influence their offshore transport. Neustonic fish larvae showed potential for significant dispersion during summer, as a result of offshore Ekman transport. 

Mesoscale Leeuwin Current eddies were a feature of the oceanography of the region, and their influence on larval fish assemblages was examined in both an anti-cyclonic eddy (warm-core) and a cyclonic eddy (cold-core). The warm-core eddy contained larval fish assemblages that were distinct from those in the cold-core eddy, with lower larval fish concentrations, especially in the eddy centre. Although the eddies originated near the continental shelf, larval fish assemblages within both eddies were largely oceanic, probably a result of the age of the eddies when they were sampled (about 5 months). 

Overall, larval fish assemblages showed strong temporal and spatial structure, and were well aligned to water masses in the region. The unique oceanography off south western Australia thus has considerable implications for both larval fish transport, and potential recruitment to regional fisheries.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">larval fish</field><field name="subject">ichthyoplankton</field><field name="subject">oceanography</field><field name="subject">Leeuwin Current</field><field name="subject">Capes Current</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.110448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shame, Admiration, and Self-Esteem</field><field name="creator">Clearly@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the shame that inheres in not being able to self-admire. I call this incapacity to admire oneself ontological shame, and I argue that it is the source of the masquerades, concealments and negative emotions that surround the pursuit and defence of a self-esteem founded on an impoverished form of pride. I argue that there is a radical asymmetry between our admiration and esteem for others and how we evaluate our own sense of self-worth. Where admiration at its highest pitch is the wonderful agape experience of apprehending preciousness in others, our own sense of self-worth is limited to experiences of pride and other forms of self-affirmation; none of which allow us the joy of seeing ourselves as wonders in the world. Because we can admire and want to be admired, not being able to self-admire amounts to a limitation of a sort which carries with it a primordial resentment against life itself. It is largely how we respond to our ontological limitation and to our resentment that determines the positive or negative manner in which we interact with others, and whether or not we are likely to have an envious or humble disposition. 

In the first three chapters I lay the groundwork for the main argument of the thesis by highlighting the difficulties self-esteem theorists have in agreeing upon the value of &#145;high&#146; self-esteem, introduce the relation between self-esteem and shame, argue for a distinction between self-esteem and public esteem, and provide an account of the gift-exchange nature of admiration which explains why we cannot self-admire. In the central chapters I focus on shame; on acts of concealment that can be either appropriate covering for, or deceitful denial of our ontological limitation; how self-worth is created through a reconciliation to shame, and why the &#145;self-act dissociation&#146; theories of guilt fail to capture the shame attached to &#145;being guilty&#146; of a wrongdoing. In Chapters Seven and Eight I examine envy, first in how it can be disguised as moral resentment; how it differs to admiration in its role in emulation, and finally how as a disposition it stands in stark contrast to humility. It is in humility that we grasp the benefits associated with our own incapacity to self-admire through our need to interact and exchange gifts with others.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shame</field><field name="subject">sef-esteem</field><field name="subject">moral psychology</field><field name="subject">envy</field><field name="subject">resentment</field><field name="subject">humility</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.122025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baby Graves: Infant Mortality in Merthyr Tydfil 1865-1908.</field><field name="creator">Lberes@bigpond.net.au</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the problem of infant mortality in Merthyr Tydfil 1865-
1908. In particular it investigates why Merthyr Tydfil, an iron, steel and coal producing
town in south Wales, experienced high infant mortality rates throughout the nineteenth
century which rose by the end of the century despite sixty years of public health
reforms. The historiography of infant mortality in nineteenth-century Britain includes
few Welsh studies although the south Wales Coalfield played an important part in
industrial and demographic change in Britain during the second half of the nineteenth
century. The thesis argues that conditions of industrial development shaped the social,
economic and public health experience in Merthyr, ensnaring its citizens in social
disadvantage, reflected in the largely unacknowledged human toll among mothers and
babies in that process.

The thesis analyses the causes of over 17, 000 infant deaths in Merthyr Tydfil
from the primary evidence of an unusually complete series of Medical Officer of Health
Reports to identify the principal attributed causes of infant death and explain their
social origins and context. The thesis examines the work of Dr. Thomas Jones Dyke,
MOH from 1865-1900, who was the author of most of these reports, and assesses his
career in public health, but suggests that there were limits to his capacity to address the
problem of infant mortality. The analysis showed convulsions, tuberculosis, measles
and whooping cough, lung diseases, diarrhoea, nutritional causes of death and infant
deaths from antenatal causes of maternal origin to be those which drove up infant
mortality rates in Merthyr from the 1880s. From 1902 antenatal causes of infant death,
independent of the sanitary environment, and directly linked to the health of mothers,
were the only ones still rising.

Public health reforms were unable to address the social factors which
engendered poverty and ill-health. Large families dependent mainly on male
breadwinners had little margin of economic safety. Industrial conflicts in Merthyr
revealed the inability of the Poor Law to address the problems of mass destitution in an
urban setting. Women experienced few employment opportunities, married early and
undertook heavy domestic labour reflected in early death rates for women and high
perinatal infant death rates due to the poor health and socio-economic status of mothers.
The training of midwives from 1902, with the potential to save many infant lives and to
advocate for working-class mothers, failed to do so in Merthyr by 1908.

Although specifically addressing the issues of infant mortality in nineteenthcentury
Britain, the issues raised are of contemporary relevance since infant deaths
reflect many social dynamics of inequality through which infant lives are inevitably
sacrificed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infant mortality</field><field name="subject">merthyr tydfil</field><field name="subject">Wales</field><field name="subject">Social History 1865 -1905</field><field name="subject">maternal health</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.125515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Captured becomings:  An assemblage of sexual difference, neoliberal capitalism and bodies in the boys&#146; education debate.</field><field name="creator">go_brad@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">This study investigates the current influence of conservative political, social and economic forces in structuring the perspectives of five pre-service teachers on the education of boys. I argue that these perspectives are constituted by a conservative assemblage of essentialist discourses of sexuality and neoliberal capitalism and these largely extend the indomitable power of conservative forces increasingly shaping social relations inside and outside the field of education.

The interviews reveal that conservative discourses of sexual difference dominate the perspectives on boys and their schooling and this reliance on essentialist notions of sexuality effectively gives rise to a conflicting roles discourse that informs a recuperative masculinity politics and feminist backlash. I argue the social transformation effected by neoliberal economics is largely silenced when discussing boys and education and this allows participants to largely &#145;blame&#146; feminism for the transformation of labour markets, work patterns, family relationships and gendered subjectivities, silencing its powerful influence. I contend personal insecurity and anxiety generated by neoliberal economic transformation have proliferated conservative discourses of sexuality, producing a defence of rigid sexual boundaries that proscribe the potential of male and female bodies by capturing their &#145;becoming&#146;, and to this extent I argue that conservative discourses of sexual difference are coextensive with the aims of neoliberal capitalism. However, rather than position men as victims, I argue the conservative assemblage including the boys&#146; debate make available diverse ways for many individuals to experience their body powerfully, with the attributes and capacities of hegemonic masculinity being proliferated. The boys&#146; debate is one resource for producing powerful subjectivities while extending the territory of the conservative assemblage increasingly constituting our world.

Methodologically this is a qualitative inquiry that utilizes discourse analysis extensively informed by poststructural theories of knowledge, power and the subject. I also make connections with the work of Deleuze and Guattari and the theories of corporeal feminism, including a theory of the body as a machinic assemblage in order to interrogate the conservative territorialisation of subjectivity and social relations.

Many of these coastal locations share a similar post contact history of a constant effort to create and maintain sustainable communities.  Most have experienced several different dominant land uses since European occupation as various political and ideological forces have promoted new ideas and technologies to exploit the available natural resources.  Remnants of these past activities, including pre European land use, still remain and have now become an important component of the cultural heritage and tourist product in these coastal regions.  

The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region occupies the extreme south western corner of Western Australia approximately 250km south of the city of Perth and is one location that shares this experience.  The region is presently one of the fastest growing areas in Western Australia outside of the metropolitan area.  Between 1991 and 2001 the population of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region increased by 65% to 31, 911 (ABS 2001).  Although the region has been experiencing unprecedented growth since the late 1980s, it had previously comprised mostly small rural communities struggling to maintain their populations and economic viability.  The Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region has been &#145;discovered&#146; no less than seven times since European occupation in 1830.  It has been &#145;invaded&#146; by a series of different people from both the public and private sectors who have initiated diverse land uses for different objectives.  Each new land use activity was initiated from outside the region as people reappraised the environment with little consideration of the knowledge of the local environment obtained through past land use activities.  These new land uses were usually politically or demand driven and related to the broader development of the state rather than the long term viability of the local region.  Whilst the phenomenal development associated with tourism constitutes the most recent land use activity, tourism was preceded by Early European agricultural Settlement from the 1830s; the timber Industry from the 1850s; the Group Settlements and establishment of a dairy industry from the 1920s; the alternative lifestylers from the 1960s and the viticultural industry from the 1970s.

This thesis will explore both the historical and contemporary processes which have played a significant part in shaping the region&#146;s cultural landscapes and underpin the current development issues it is experiencing.  It is argued that much of the land use history of this region has been framed by a consistent frontier ethos and that it is only relatively recently the concept of sustainable development has begun to be implemented even though ironically its principles were effectively guiding land use practices for centuries before European settlement.  This thesis concludes that for the most recent land use activity of tourism to achieve the long term sustainability that has eluded so many past land uses, development must facilitate multiple land use management and encourage the continued incorporation of past land use activities to maintain the region&#146;s cultural, social and economic diversity rather than tourism overpowering them to become the dominant activity.  At the same time, of course, these multiple land uses must themselves be managed by contemporary and evolving principles of sustainable development.  All stakeholders both within and outside the region need to adopt a more holistic sustainable approach to managing the region&#146;s resources learning from both past land use attempts and the principles of Indigenous cosmology including the importance of the interconnectedness of people, environment and economy.  If this is achieved then it is more likely that both current and future generations will have a high quality of life with long term economic security that also ensures the long term maintenance of their socio-cultural and environmental resources.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.131320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occurrence and variation of Endothiella eucalypti in Eucalyptus globulus plantations of south-western Australia and the influence of some biotic and abiotic factors on the response of the host to the pathogen.</field><field name="creator">Tania.Jackson@dec.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">As the Eucalyptus globulus plantation industry expands and matures in southwestern
Australia (WA), the impact of disease within the plantation environment is predicted to
increase. This thesis investigated the most abundant canker-causing pathogen
associated with branch and stem cankers, Endothiella eucalypti the anamorph of
Cryphonectria eucalypti. Endothiella eucalypti was widespread, although at low
incidence, throughout the WA plantation estate and was frequently observed
sporulating on the bark of healthy hosts in the absence of disease. Regions with a long
(approximately 20 years) plantation history, such as Bunbury, had the highest incidence
of this pathogen. A high degree of variability in pathogenicity, growth rate and colony
morphology was observed between WA isolates of En. eucalypti.

In the glasshouse, a significant variation in susceptibility of seven E. globulus
provenances to En. eucalypti was observed. Although an interaction between
the E. globulus provenance and En. eucalypti isolate was recorded, some provenances
were generally more susceptible than others. In two 18-month-old plantations, the
susceptibility of three provenances to En. eucalypti was significantly influenced by
environmental conditions. Visual assessment of general tree health indicated that less
healthy trees had smaller lesions than healthy trees. It is hypothesised that the selection
of E. globulus provenances to suit site conditions in the future should decrease the risk
of serious disease, especially on marginal sites.

Endothiella eucalypti caused disease in intact stems of two-year-old E. globulus under
glasshouse conditions. This suggests that En. eucalypti may not require a wound to
infect in the field.

Vegetative compatibility groupings between WA En. eucalypti isolates indicated a
relatively high degree of genotypic diversity within the WA asexual population of
En. eucalypti, whereas inter-simple sequence repeats PCR (ISSR-PCR) analysis
indicated a lower level of genotypic diversity. Discrepancies between traditional and
molecular techniques, such as ISSR-PCR, was attributed to the more specific gene-togene
analysis afforded by molecular techniques. ISSR-PCR successfully distinguished
variability within the En. eucalypti population and with the teleomorph, isolated in
South Africa. It also separated Cryphonectria cubensis isolates from the C. eucalypti
isolates.

As copper is the micronutrient most limiting growth of E. globulus in WA, its role in
the resistance of two E. globulus provenances was examined in a glasshouse trial.
Lesion extension or defence responses of E. globulus to En. eucalypti did not differ
between Cu-adequate and Cu-deficient plants. It is suggested that constitutive levels of
host defence enzymes played a more important role in providing protection for the host
against En. eucalypti than the external supply of copper.

A reduction in the canopy volume of E. globulus within plantations due to insect
herbivory or foliar pathogens, such as Mycosphaerella spp., has been reported to
predispose the host to disease caused by non-aggressive canker-causing fungi. Under
two separate glasshouse trials, conditions of 100% defoliation and 80% defoliation
maintained over six weeks prior to inoculation, were required to significantly increase
lesion extension caused by En. eucalypti in E. globulus stems. The ability of defoliated
E. globulus to retain a degree of resistance to En. eucalypti was attributed to the rapid
replacement of foliage and up-regulation of photosynthesis in remaining leaves. The
carbohydrate reserves of the plant were depleted following defoliation and remained
depressed regardless of the length of time the trees remained defoliated.

In conclusion, the endophytic habit of En. eucalypti poses a threat to highly stressed
trees, however it does not appear to be an immediate threat to WA plantation health.
Although En. eucalypti has not yet been responsible for a major disease outbreak in
WA, the impact of this disease on plantation-grown eucalypts elsewhere in Australia
and worldwide serves as an indication of its potential to affect WA plantations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endothiella eucalypti</field><field name="subject">eucalyptus globulas</field><field name="subject">plantations</field><field name="subject">host response</field><field name="subject">canker pathogen</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.132615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between Phytophthora cinnamomiand Acacia pulchella: consequences on ecology and epidemiology of the pathogen</field><field name="creator">A.Jayasekera@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi is an important pathogen of many plant species in natural ecosystems and horticulture industries around the world. In Western Australia, a high proportion of native plant species are susceptible to P. cinnamomi attack. Acacia pulchella, a resistant legume species native to Western Australia has been considered as a potential biological control tool against P. cinnamomi. To develop effective control methods, it is important to understand the interactions between the control agent and the different life forms of the pathogen. In this thesis the interactions are investigated between P. cinnamomi and varieties of A. pulchella which occur in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest and sand plain ecosystems. 

The soil inoculum of P. cinnamomi was compared under the potted plants of the three common varieties of A. pulchella, var. pulchella, var. glaberrima and var. goadbyi. These were grown in infected jarrah forest soil in the glasshouse and in vitro in a sterilised soil-less mix aseptically. Acacia urophylla (a species non suppressive towards P. cinnamomi) was also included as a control. An isolate of the most commonly found clonal lineage of P. cinnamomi in the jarrah forest, A2 type 1 was selected for use in experiments after testing showed it reliably produced zoospores and chlamydospores both axenically and in non-sterile conditions, in comparison to several other isolates. The lowest survival of P. cinnamomi inoculum was found under A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants grown both in non sterile soil and in aseptic soil-less mix.

All the life forms of P. cinnamomi were affected by A. pulchella (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5). The soil leachates from potted plants of A. pulchella var. goadbyi reduced sporangial production (Chapter 2) and caused cytoplasm collapse of chlamydospores (Chapter 3). The confirmation was obtained that soil under A. pulchella was inhibitory to sporangial stage of P. cinnamomi and new evidence was obtained on chlamydospore inactivation. Cytoplasm collapse in the chlamydospores was observed both for chlamydospores on mycelial discs on Mira cloth exposed to the soil leachate and within infected roots buried in soils under the three varieties of A. pulchella plants. The effect was strongest under the plants of A. pulchella var. goadbyi and indicated that the chlamydospores of P. cinnamomi are unlikely to act as persistent structures under A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants.

In Chapter 4, bioassays were conducted with axenically produced mycelia, chlamydospores and zoospores to test the inhibitory effect of the root exudates collected from aseptically grown A. pulchella var. goadbyi plants. The zoospores of the same isolate used in the soil leachate tests were immobilised (became sluggish and encysted) within one to two minutes. When incubated for 24 h, zoospores predominantly clumped and germ tubes were observed only from the clumped ones. Chlamydospores produced by four isolates of the common A2 type 1 strain and the only one A2 type 2 strain  available at the time were tested. A higher percentage of chlamydospores collapsed and a very low percentage germinated after 24 h. Chlamydospores of all the A2 type 1 isolates were inhibited by the root exudates whilst the A2 type 2 isolate remained viable. The findings showed that the suppressive effect must be due at least in part to substances exuded by the A. pulchella plants. However, it appeared that the A2 type 1 isolates were more vulnerable to this effect than the single A2 type 2 isolate.

In Chapter 5, the effect of season on sporangial suppression of P. cinnamomi was shown using field soils collected from three jarrah forest soil vegetation types and a Banksia woodland on Bassendean sand, collected in winter and summer. The effect of age of A. pulchella plants was demonstrated using the soils collected from rehabilitated bauxite mine pits. In all the locations soils were collected under A. pulchella plants and 5 m away from the nearest A. pulchella. An effect of soil type was evident as whilst the soil leachates made from the three lateritic jarrah forest soil types where A. pulchella is common in the understorey were suppressive to the sporangial stage of P. cinnamomi, this effect was not evident in the Bassendean sand under A. pulchella. A. pulchella soils collected in winter were less suppressive towards sporangial production than soils collected in summer. An effect of plant age was demonstrated as soil leachates from four year-old A. pulchella stands in rehabilitated bauxite mine sites were more suppressive for sporangia than leachates from one year-old stands. 

Further information on the behaviour of the pathogen in soil and in potting mix with and without A. pulchella was obtained by infecting lupin radicles with an isolate of each A2 type, 1 and 2 strains of P. cinnamomi and burying them in the soil under the three varieties of A. pulchella plants. After a week, the chlamydospores were mostly collapsed and hyphae deteriorated. Oospores were observed and in significant numbers under the potted plants of A. pulchella var. glaberrima. 

Isolates of all three clonal lineages of P. cinnamomi found in Australian soil were tested for the ability to produce oospores. Two isolates of the A1 and A2 type 2 and three isolates of the common A2 type 1 were screened. The two isozyme types of the A2 clonal lineage isolated in Australia varied in ability to self and produce oospores in planta in several soils from the jarrah forest. The isozyme type 2 of the A2 clonal lineage of P. cinnamomi produced oospores under these experimental conditions. This stimulation was not effective for most of the tested isolates of the A2 type 1 and the A1 clonal lineage. The in planta oospores were viable but dormant and the oogonial-antheridial associations were amphigynous both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time it was established that, the stimulus for selfing and oospore formation in the A2 type 2 of P. cinnamomi is available in some jarrah forest soils, with and without A. pulchella and also in the potting mix used. This raises important questions for the management of the pathogen.

Several factors were identified as potential stimuli for selfing. Among them, soil nutrient levels and essentially enhanced sulphur presence were found important.  Temperature also played a key role. Oospores were produced abundantly at 21 &#150; 25 &#186;C but not over 28 &#186;C.

The biology of P. cinnamomi has been studied for several decades but some important aspects remain un-researched. This thesis pioneers research into the in planta selfing aspect of the pathogen in soil. It also improved the understanding of the interactions between P. cinnamomi and A. pulchella which to some extent supports use of A. pulchella as a biological control tool against P. cinnamomi. However, attention is drawn to the natural mechanisms of this complex pathogen to survive in planta by producing oospores, the most persistent form of its life cycle.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inviro oospores</field><field name="subject">selfed oospores</field><field name="subject">collapsed chlamydospores</field><field name="subject">jarrrah forest soil</field><field name="subject">root exudates</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere effect</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.134500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Porcine Circoviruses</field><field name="creator">jmuhling@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Two types of porcine circovirus (PCV) exist, referred to as PCV1 and PCV2.  PCV2 has been associated with disease syndromes in pigs, including that designated postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has been identified in all regions of the world bar Australia (Hamel et al., 1998; Allan et al., 1999a; Onuki et al., 1999;  Martelli et al., 2000; Kyriakis et al., 2000; Wellenberg et al., 2000; Done et al., 2001; Trujano et al., 2001; Saradell et al., 2004; Castro et al., 2004; Jemersic et al., 2004; Maldonado et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Motovski and Segales, 2004; Garkavenko et al., 2005).  PMWS affects young weaner pigs and results in weight loss, tachypnea, dyspnea, enlarged lymph nodes and jaundice (Harding, 1998).  PCV2 may also cause or contribute to other swine diseases such as congential tremors (CT) (Stevenson et al., 1999), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) (Rosell et al., 2000), reproductive failure (Meehan et al., 2001) and several other emerging disease syndromes.  PCV1 is currently considered to be non-pathogenic. Although PMWS has not been reported in Australia, information on the distribution, variation and further characterisation of PCV in Australian pigs was necessary as it might provide insights into why there is no PCV-associated disease in this country.  The results reported in this thesis involved the detection and further study of porcine circovirus in Australia.

This chapter provides an outline of this thesis and the work undertaken, while Chapter 2 is a review of the relevant literature with particular reference to circoviral diseases.  Chapter 3 describes the detection of both PCV1 and PCV2 in the Australian pig herd, using a multiplex PCR designed to differentiate between the two viral types. The association of Australian PCV with two disease outbreaks was also investigated.  Following the detection of both viruses, it was important to genetically compare Australian PCV with overseas strains known to cause disease, and this was achieved with a sequencing and phylogenetic study as described in Chapter 4.  Possible reasons for the genetic groupings and distribution of different PCV2 strains worldwide are also discussed in this chapter.

As PMWS is as yet unidentified in Australian pigs, the importation of pig meat into Australia from countries with the disease requires careful monitoring.  Current protocols for the cooking of imported pig meat were designed to inactivate porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus (PRRSV), and as such may not be effective against PCV.  In this study (Chapter 5), Australian PCV2 was successfully infected into cell culture, and detected using a variety of techniques. Subsequently, thermal stability experiments were performed using a newly-developed immunoperoxidase (IPMA) test.  It was anticipated that this study would determine whether current importation protocols require revision, and the results would suggest that this is the case, with PCV2 unaffected by treatment comparable with current cooking protocols.

While no animal experiments were undertaken in this study, it may become necessary to infect pigs with Australian PCV to determine viral pathogenicity.  Cell culture inoculums have been used in the past overseas, but problems with contamination and viral titre have been encountered (Fenaux et al., 2001).  Viral infectious clones can be used to overcome these problems, so an infectious clone of Australian PCV2 was constructed, as described in Chapter 6.  While time constraints prevented the clone from being infected into culture, it is anticipated that the construct would be infectious as it is based on a previously published method (Hattermann et al., 2004). Chapter 7 is a general discussion of the results and conclusions from this study.

The detection and characterisation of Australian PCV as described in this study has provided further information on the status of PCV in the Australian pig herd, and also developed diagnostic tests to assist in future research.  These tools will be important when assessing and managing the risk of Australia experiencing PCV-associated diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porcine</field><field name="subject">circoviruses</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.141643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributions, relative abundances and reproductive biology of the deep-water crabs Hypothalassia acerba and Chaceon bicolor in southwestern Australia</field><field name="creator">kdsmith@fish.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Three species of large crab are found in Western Australian waters, namely the champagne crab Hypothalassia acerba, the crystal crab Chaceon bicolor and the giant crab Pseudocarcinus gigas, all of which are fished commercially in these waters.  This thesis reports the results of studies carried out on the biology of the first two species, for which there were previously very little information.  The results increase our knowledge of the benthic fauna in deeper waters off the southwestern Australian coast and provide data that can be used by fisheries managers to develop plans for conserving the stocks of H. acerba and C. bicolor.
	The champagne crab Hypothalassia acerba  is found southwards of Kalbarri at ~ 27&#132;aS, 114&#132;aE on the west coast and eastwards to Eucla at ~ 32&#132;aS, 129&#132;aE on the south coast.  There is a small commercial trap fishery for H. acerba on both the lower west and south coasts of Western Australia.  However, on the west coast, H. acerba is managed as a single species fishery, whereas on the south coast it is a component of a multi-species fishery, which also includes the southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii and P. gigas.  On the west coast, the commercial catches of H. acerba increased sharply from ~ 1,500 kg in 1989 to reach maximum levels of 30-46,000 kg in 1997-99, reflecting a marked increase in fishing effort.  However, it subsequently declined to essentially zero after 2000 due to effort shifting towards fishing for C. bicolor.  Catches of H. acerba on the south coast peaked at 26-27,000 kg in 1997-98 but, in contrast to those on the west coast, remained relatively high in 2001 to 2003. 
The crystal crab Chaceon bicolor occurs in water depths of ~ 450 to 1220 m around Australia and New Zealand.  However the commercial fishery is almost entirely located between Carnarvon on the north-west coast at ~ 25&#132;aS, 113&#132;aE to approximately Windy Harbor at ~ 35&#132;aS, 116&#132;aE on the south coast.  Commercial catches of C. bicolor in southwestern Australia, which came almost entirely from the lower west coast, rose from very low levels in 1997 to ~ 222,000 kg in 2001 and then remained close to this level in 2002 and 2003.  These trends largely reflect an increase in fishing effort.   
Hypothalassia acerba was sampled seasonally by setting traps at depths of 35, 90, 145, 200, 255, 310 and 365 m on the west and south coasts of Western Australia.  Catch rates on the west and south coasts peaked sharply at depths of 200 and 145 m, respectively, but at similar temperatures of 16 - 17&#162;XC.  The catches on those coasts contained 69 and 84% males, respectively.  The carapace length of H. acerba declined significantly by 4 mm for each 100 m increase in depth.  Males attained a greater maximum carapace length than females on both the west coast, i.e. 135 vs 113 mm, and south coast, i.e. 138 vs 120 mm.  Furthermore, after adjustment to a common depth of 200 m, the mean carapace length of males was greater than females on both the west coast (96.6 vs 94.6 mm) and south coast (101.5 and 91.4 mm) and the latter difference was significant (p &lt; 0.001).   These results thus show that, for H. acerba, (1) the distribution is related to depth and temperature, (2) body size is inversely related to water depth and (3) males grow to a larger size and are more prevalent in catches than females.  There was also evidence that the distribution of H. acerba changed slightly with season and that there was spatial partitioning by this species and other large deep water invertebrate predators.
The trends exhibited by reproductive variables demonstrate that H. acerba reproduces seasonally on the lower west coast, with ovaries maturing progressively between July and December and oviposition occurring between January and March.  The characteristics of H. acerba on the south coast differed in the following ways from those on the lower west coast. (i) No ovigerous females and only two females with egg remnants were caught. (ii) Ovaries did not develop late yolk granule oocytes until females had reached a larger size. (iii) Investment in gonadal development was less. These results strongly suggest that conditions on the south coast are not as conducive for ovarian development and reproduction and indicate that females migrate from the south to lower west coast for spawning. In contrast to H. acerba, C. bicolor reproduces throughout much or all of the year on the lower west coast, presumably reflecting its occupancy of far deeper waters where environmental conditions vary less during the year. Although the mean weights of ovigerous females of H. acerba and C. bicolor were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05), the mean fecundity of the former species (356,210) was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) than that of the latter species (192,070). The relatively high fecundity of H. acerba may reflect adaptations by this species to optimise egg production during its relatively short breeding season.
The size at onset of sexual maturity (SOM) of the females of crustacean species, which is often used by fisheries managers for developing management plans for such species, is typically estimated using logistic regression analysis of the proportions of mature females in sequential size classes. The validity of this approach depends on the composition of the samples reflecting accurately that present in the environment. However, catches obtained by traps, a passive fishing method, typically contain disproportionately greater numbers of large crabs, whereas those obtained using active fishing methods, such as seine netting and otter trawling, will presumably represent far better the size composition of the population. Since H. acerba and C. bicolor could be caught in numbers only by using traps, comparisons between the influence of passive and active fishing methods were explored using the extensive data previously collected for Portunus pelagicus employing different sampling methods (de Lestang et al. 2003a,b).  These data are analysed in order to demonstrate that the females of P. pelagicus caught by trapping were predominantly mature, whereas those obtained by seining and trawling contained numerous immature as well as mature females.  The samples of females collected by trap are, therefore, clearly biased towards mature crabs. Consequently, for any size class, it would be predicted that the proportion of mature females in trap catches will be overestimated, thus shifting the logistic curve fitted to the proportions of mature crabs at each size to the left, and thereby yielding an underestimate of the SOM. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that the carapace width of female P. pelagicus, at which 50% of individuals reach maturity (SOM50), was estimated to be markedly greater when using the proportion of mature females obtained by seine-netting and otter trawling collectively, i.e. 101.1 mm, than by trapping, i.e. 86.1 mm.  From the above data for P. pelagicus, it is considered likely that, through a greater vulnerability of mature females of these species to capture by traps, the respective SOM50s derived for female H. acerba and C. bicolor from trap samples (i.e. carapace lengths of 69.7 and 90.5 mm) will represent considerable underestimates of the true SOM50s.
Many workers have assumed that the chelae of male crabs undergo a change in allometry at the pubertal moult and that this could thus be used as the basis for determining the size of those crabs at morphometric maturity.  Since initial plots of the logarithms of propodus length and carapace width (CW) of the males of P. pelagicus and carapace length (CL) of the males of H. acerba and C. bicolor revealed no conspicuous change in allometry, the question of whether the chelae of these species undergo such an allometric change was explored statistically.  The Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria were thus used to ascertain whether a linear, quadratic, broken stick or overlapping-lines model best represented the above logarithmic size data.  Since the broken stick model provided the best fit for P. pelagicus, the chelae of this species does undergo allometric change. This occurred at 80.0 mm CW, which is ~ 8 mm less than the CW at physiological maturity.  In contrast, my analyses provided no evidence that the chelae of either H. acerba or C. bicolor exhibited an inflection and thus morphometric maturity could not be determined for these two species from chela length.  Thus, mangers will have to use the SOM50 for physiological maturity, which was estimated to be 68.1 and 94.3 mm CL for H. acerba and C. bicolor, respectively.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deep water crabs</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061129.142618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemistry of Cathode Materials in Aqueous Lithium Hydroxide Electrolyte</field><field name="creator">minakshi@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Electrochemical behavior of electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD), chemically prepared battery grade manganese dioxide (BGM), titanium dioxide (TiO2), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and lithium manganese phosphate (LiMnPO4) in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte has been investigated. These materials are commonly used as cathodes in non-aqueous electrolyte lithium batteries. The main aim of the work was to determine how the electroreduction/oxidation behavior of these materials in aqueous LiOH compares with that reported in the literature in non-aqueous electrolytes in connection with lithium batteries. An objective was to establish whether these materials could also be used to develop other battery systems using aqueous LiOH as electrolyte. 

The electrochemical characteristics of the above materials were investigated by subjecting them to slow scan cyclic voltammetry and determining the charge/discharge characteristics of Zn/cathode material-aqueous LiOH batteries. The products of electroreduction/oxidation were characterized by physical techniques using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrography (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and infra-red spectrometry (IR). 

The reduction of &#227;-MnO2 (EMD) in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte is found to result in intercalation of Li+ into the host structure of &#227;-MnO2. The process was found to be reversible for many cycles. This is similar to what is known to occur for &#227;-MnO2 in non-aqueous electrolytes. The mechanism, however, differs from that for reduction/oxidation of &#227;-MnO2 in aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. KOH electrolyte is used in the state-of-art aqueous alkaline Zn/MnO2 batteries. Alkaline batteries based on aqueous KOH as the electrolyte rely upon a mechanism other than K+ intercalation into MnO2. This mechanism is not reversible. This is explained in terms of the relative ionic sizes of Li+ and K+. The lithium-intercalated MnO2 lattice is stable because Li+ and Mn4+ are of approximately the same size and hence Li+ is accommodated nicely into the host lattice of MnO2. The K+ ion which has almost double the size of Li+ cannot be appropriately accommodated into the host structure and hence the K+ -intercalated MnO2 phase is not stable. 

Chemically prepared battery grade MnO2 (BGM) is found to undergo electroreduction/oxidation in aqueous LiOH via the same Li+ intercalation mechanism as for the EMD. While the Zn/BGM- aqueous LiOH cell discharges at a voltage higher than that for the Zn/EMD- aqueous LiOH cell under similar conditions, the rechargeability and the material utilization of the BGM cell is poorer. 
The cathodic behavior of TiO2 (anatase phase) in the presence of aqueous LiOH is not reversible. In addition to LiTiO2, Ti2O3 is also formed. The discharge voltage of the Zn/TiO2- aqueous LiOH cell and material utilization of the TiO2 as cathode are very low. Hence TiO2 is not suitable for use in any aqueous LiOH electrolyte battery.  

LiFePO4 (olivine-type structure) as a cathode undergoes electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming FePO4. However the subsequent reduction forms not only the original LiFePO4 but also Fe3O4. Thus the process is not completely reversible and hence LiFePO4 is not a suitable material for use as a cathode in aqueous battery systems.

LiMnPO4 (olivine-type structure) undergoes reversible electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming MnPO4. The charge/discharge voltage profile of the Zn/MnPO4-aqueous LiOH cell, its coulombic efficiency and rechargeability are comparable to that of the cell using &#227;-MnO2. EMD and LiMnPO4 both have the potential for use in rechargeable batteries using aqueous LiOH as the electrolyte. Recommendations for further developmental work for such batteries are made.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aqueous lithium battery; cathode; lithium hydroxide; electrolyte; lithium insertion; XRD; XPS; SEM; SIMS.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061210.143803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Biologically Inspired Four Legged Walking Robot</field><field name="creator">shiqi.peng@woodside.com.au</field><field name="description">This Ph.D. thesis presents the design and implementation of a biologically inspired
four-phase walking strategy using behaviours for a four legged walking robot. In
particular, the walking strategy addresses the balance issue, including both static and
dynamic balance that were triggered non-deterministically based on the robot&#146;s realtime interaction with the environment. Four parallel Subsumption Architectures
(SA) and a simple Central Pattern Producer (CPP) are employed in the physical
implementation of the walking strategy. An implementation framework for such a
parallel Subsumption Architecture is also proposed to facilitate the reusability of the
system. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) method was integrated into the CPP to
allow the robot to learn the optimal walking cycle interval (OWCI), appropriate for
the robot walking on various terrain conditions. Experimental results demonstrate
that the robot employs the proposed walking strategy and can successfully carry out
its walking behaviours under various experimental terrain conditions, such as flat
ground, incline, decline and uneven ground. Interactions of all the behaviours of the
robot enable it to exhibit a combination of both preset and emergent walking
behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">Legged</field><field name="subject">Robot</field><field name="subject">Phase</field><field name="subject">Biologically</field><field name="subject">Subsumption Architecture</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070115.113710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;Keeping the Bastards Honest&#146; &#150; The Promise and Practice of Freedom of Information Legislation</field><field name="creator">J.lidberg@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In the last decade the number of countries that have enacted Freedom of Information (FOI) laws have increased dramatically. In many respects FOI laws have become a democratic &#145;right of passage&#146;. No FOI, no &#145;proper&#146; democracy.

The promises of FOI regimes are far-reaching: access to personal information and increased transparency in the form of third-party independent access to government-held information will prevent corruption and maladministration and encourage the public to participate more fully in the political process. But are the promises borne out by the practice of FOI?

To answer this question this thesis will track a number of real-life FOI requests in five countries. Based on this and other data this project will lay the foundation for the first International Freedom of Information Index, ranking five countries on how their FOI regimes deliver on the promises made. Included in the ranking will also be an evaluation of the legal situation for media whistleblowers and shield laws for journalists.

The thesis will show that it is easier to promise information access than to implement it. It will demonstrate that for most of the countries of study FOI laws serve more as a PR tool projecting an illusion of an informed public, rather than granting real independent access to quality information.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freedom of Information Index</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070115.121829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silencing the everyday experiences of youth? - Issues of subjectivity, corporate ideology and popular culture in the English classroom.</field><field name="creator">gsavage@student.unimelb.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study investigates the influence of popular culture
texts on the subjectivities of young people and argues that critical pedagogical practices need to be further deployed by English teachers in response to the corporate driven nature of popular texts. Three levels of synthesized information are presented, using data analysis born of a quantitative survey and in-depth interviews with a group of secondary English students in Perth, Australia.

Firstly, I argue that popular culture texts constitute the predominate form of consumed textual material for young people and that these texts are increasingly defined by corporate ideologies and branding. Secondly, I investigate the influence that these popular culture texts have on the subjectivities and everyday social experiences of young people. I argue that the ideologies and discourses in popular texts position young people to assume subjectivities that are increasingly defined by branding and corporate ideology, and that these texts often have a normalizing effect.

Hence, I argue that young people&#146;s social currency is often defined by the extent to which individuals demonstrate an alliance to the ideologies of popular media, and that individuals who deviate from such popular norms often experience subjugation and exclusion within peer and social settings. Constructivist notions of subjectivity and an analytical framework heavily influenced by Foucauldian theory inform this theorization. Thirdly, I finalize my argument by dealing pedagogically with subject English and areas of it that hold relevance in terms of the integration and analysis of &#145;the popular&#146;; including critical literacy, multiliteracies and critical pedagogy. I argue that a commitment to critically analyzing popular culture texts in the subject is lacking and that students feel many English teachers are &#147;out of touch&#148; with the everyday realities of young people and their popular culture influences. I argue that such failures risk producing students whose everyday experiences are silenced and who are unaware of the ways they are being positioned to adopt certain corporate driven subjectivities.

Methodologically this study is informed by principles of critical theory, cultural studies, discourse analysis and a commitment to position the often-silenced student voice as a prime analytical tool. Aspects of autoethnography are deployed through punctuating personal narratives that feature within this text in order to illuminate the journey of self-realization and fundamental self reevaluation I have traveled throughout the production of this research work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth subjectivity</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="subject">critical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">english</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070115.122534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative and co-existence : mediating between indigenous and non-indigenous stories</field><field name="creator">K.Trees@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Ths thesis demonstrates how theory and praxis may be integrated within a

The main causative species in Australia are B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Infection with these species can lead to wet litter and reduced egg production. Currently, little is known about how these organisms enter flocks and spread, or how to control them. The economic losses to the poultry industry caused by AIS are thought to be significant, however problems with diagnostic techniques have resulted in this disease often being overlooked.
The major aims of this thesis were to expand understanding of the epidemiology and cycles of transmission of B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli, measure the effectiveness of six disinfectants, develop faster and more reliable diagnostic identification methods, and to investigate effects of diet on colonisation by the spirochaetes.
An epidemiological study on a laying hen farm detected infection with three different Brachyspira species, with multiple strains of these species being present. Infection appeared to have originated from other birds on the site rather than from environmental sources. Experiments showed that B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli survived in chicken faeces for between 2 and 17 hours at 37oC. B. intermedia tended to survive longer than B. pilosicoli, but the maximum survival time for both species at 4oC was only 72-84 hours. 
A study was then conducted into the efficacy of some common disinfectants in inactivating B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Six disinfectants were evaluated at their recommended working concentrations. All but alkaline salts inactivated two different concentrations of both spirochaete species in less than one minute in the presence of organic matter. Taken together, these results suggest that it should be relatively easy to break the cycle of infection by emptying, cleaning and disinfecting sheds between batches of birds. 
To improve diagnostic methodology, a two-step nested duplex PCR (D-PCR) was developed for detection of B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia, using DNA extracted from washed chicken faeces. The new test could provide results within 24 hours of sample receipt, and detected 4-5% more positive faecal samples than selective culture followed by individual species-specific PCRs. 
Finally, studies were conducted in experimentally-infected laying hens to investigate potential interactions between diet and colonisation with B. intermedia or B. pilosicoli. In the first experiment, the addition of zinc bacitracin or dietary enzymes to a wheat-based diet reduced colonisation by B. intermedia. In subsequent experiments, it was shown that diets based on wheat predisposed to colonisation with B. intermedia compared to diets based on barley or barley and sorghum. Subsequently, wheat variety Westonia was shown to increase susceptibility to B. intermedia but decrease it to B. pilosicoli, compared to a diet based on wheat variety Stiletto. There was no clear relationship between the soluble non-starch polysaccharide content of a given diet, the viscosity of the digesta in the ileum, or colonization with the spirochaete species. Addition of different dietary enzymes did not significantly reduce the digesta viscosity in the ileum, or significantly influence faecal water content. 
In flocks with persistent problems with AIS consideration should be given to modifying the diet, and, in particular, cereals other than wheat should be used. The wheat variety could be altered, but the addition of dietary enzymes to such wheat-based diets is not particularly reliable as a sole means of controlling AIS.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070129.142632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of an appropriate analogy for sports entitites incorporated under associations incorporation legislation in Australia and New Zealand using broadly conceived corporate law organic theory</field><field name="creator">chuntly@parliament.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Common lawyers are notoriously suspicious of legal theory. This is exemplified by the dearth of theoretical content in Australian corporate law debate. If the first sin of legal theory is &#147;to presume that it can offer a blueprint for actual decision-making and be a substitute for judicial and lawyerly wisdom&#148;, then surely it is an equal transgression to profess that judicial and lawyerly wisdom can for long elude criticism without a sound theoretical basis.

Reasoning by analogy is commonplace. This is as true in legal reasoning as in any other discipline. Indeed, it has been suggested that in the Australian legal context analogical reasoning is the very same &#147;judicial and lawyerly wisdom&#148; referred to above. In order to determine whether there is a true analogy, a number of legal scholars have suggested that a variety of potential known source analogues should be carefully analysed for their potential relevance to a less familiar target analogue lest an inapt analogy should lead one into error.

The modern trading company is widely regarded as an apt source analogue for resolving jurisprudential issues involving incorporated associations and societies. However the basis upon which this assertion is made has never been adequately elucidated. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the modern trading company is the most apt source analogue for developing a jurisprudence of incorporated associations and societies. This is achieved using a theoretical approach drawn from corporate realist theory that is informed by an epidemiological investigation of incorporated sporting associations and societies in Australia and New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Corporate Legal Theory</field><field name="subject">Organic Theory</field><field name="subject">Incorporated Associations</field><field name="subject">Incorporated Societies</field><field name="subject">Charity Law</field><field name="subject">Analogy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070129.145203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking Mabo as a clash of constitutional languages</field><field name="creator">stephen.robson@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">The 1992 decision of the High Court of Australia to uphold the claim of the Meriam people was welcomed as beginning a new era where the unique status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would gain recognition. Intense debate and activity ensued with federal parliament adopting a legislative framework to recognise native title and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation considering its broader constitutional implications. Fourteen years on though much of the promise of Mabo lies unfulfilled.
This thesis draws upon the work of Canadian philosopher James Tully. He writes of contemporary constitutionalism in Western society and its inability to give more than superficial recognition to cultural difference. He locates the problem as lying with the dominant language of modern constitutionalism. This language provides for two main forms of recognition: the equality of self-governing nation states and the equality of individual citizens. Tully locates a way forward through the presence of another constitutional language. Common constitutionalism has enabled an accommodation of cultural differences guided by its three conventions of mutual recognition, continuity, and consent. Moreover, it is beneficial to analysing other studies about the ability of common law to recognise the claims of Indigenous people.
Tully&#146;s contribution is applied to an examination of the Mabo events in a way that takes account of Australia&#146;s constitutional traditions. The aim is to clarify the languages employed by the representatives of Australia&#146;s institutions of governance and whether this places obstacles in the way of recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The inquiry considers the events prior to the High Court&#146;s decision, the Keating government&#146;s response, and the Howard Government&#146;s native title changes. Other chapters examine the constitutional language used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the significance of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation.
The central argument of this study is that once it is accepted that the claims of Indigenous people in Australia are constitutional, it becomes possible to appreciate that these were largely voiced through the language of human rights and common constitutionalism. In contrast, when the claims were considered by the High Court and federal parliament significant aspects were articulated through the modern constitutional language. Another thread running through the events was a desire to confront and overcome the influence of the language of White Australia. The thesis concludes by considering the significance of the findings for a settlement between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">native title</field><field name="subject">constitutionalism</field><field name="subject">mabo</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070207.131859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Restoration of Israel: Ezekiel 36-39 in Early Jewish Interpretation: A textual-comparative study of the oldest extant Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.</field><field name="creator">Ashley@harvestwest.edu.au</field><field name="description">While many have noted the differences between the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts for Ezekiel, they have done so largely to rediscover an earlier Hebrew text, or to determine which variant preserves the better reading, frequently with the aim of establishing a &#145;critical text&#146; for their commentaries. This often leaves the other variant(s) in a sense &#145;incorrect&#146;, often attributed to various forms of scribal error.

This thesis adopts a &#145;textual-comparative&#146; methodology that accords each textual witness equal status as an interpretive trajectory, enabling each to be &#145;heard&#146; in its own right. The aim of this thesis is to examine these different witnesses with a view to determine what they might tell us about the way Ezekiel 36-39 was interpreted by each particular community. This entails comparing the oldest extant Hebrew and Greek texts both intra-linguistically and trans-linguistically, noting any variants, and exploring possible interpretive reasons for them.  

This study finds that the Greek translators were familiar with both languages, and that they often exegetically and interpretively interacted with the text before them. The Greek (LXX) is both translation and interpretation of the Hebrew. Other interpretations are found in &#145;inserts&#146; or &#145;plusses&#146;, occurring in both the Hebrew and Greek texts. 

Included is an examination of Papyrus 967 (G967), which exhibits a different chapter order (chapter 37 follows 38-39), and is minus 36:23c-38. Rather than finding that these differences result from error, or that G967 is a maverick text, we find that it is closest to what was probably the Hebrew Urtext. All other extant Hebrew and Greek texts then exhibit theological interaction; the change of chapter order exhibiting a &#145;call to arms&#146;, and the inserted pericope (36:23c-38) exhibiting a &#145;call to purity&#146;. Our research methodology thus elucidates the earliest Jewish interpretation of the Restoration of Israel in Ezekiel 36-39 (ca. 200-50 BCE).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="subject">Greek</field><field name="subject">Jewish Interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070220.124653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome-level studies on late maturity alpha amylase and boron tolerance in wheat</field><field name="creator">M.Carter@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Under certain environmental conditions, some varieties of wheat synthesize the enzyme alpha amylase late in grain ripening, even in the absence of rain or sprouting.  The resulting grain has a sound appearance but can be unsuitable for end-product applications due to the presence of late maturity alpha amylase (LMA) activity.  Reduction of LMA and the development of cultivars tolerant to boron toxic soils are high priority traits in the WA wheat breeding program and the use of molecular markers closely linked to these traits for marker assisted selection (MAS) is highly desirable. The aims of this study were to take a genomics approach to provide detailed structural information for the region on wheat chromosome 7BL in which quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for LMA and boron tolerance (Bo1) have been mapped.  Once the structure had been determined, this then laid the foundation for further studies to investigate the function of putative candidate genes identified within this region.  The research involved the use of bioinformatic tools and rice/wheat synteny to investigate the structure of this chromosome region, followed by the use of molecular probes to isolate genomic DNA clones (BAC clones) corresponding to this region.

A two-step bioinformatics strategy was used, involving (1) alignment of portions of the wheat and rice genomes, to identify rice genomic regions syntenic to wheat group 7L and (2) selection of candidate genes from those regions of the rice genome.  The selected candidate genes included an anion transporter, as a candidate gene for boron tolerance, and GAMYB-like genes, as candidate genes for LMA.  The GAMYB class of transcription factors identified were of particular interest because of published literature indicating its importance in controlling &#131;&#209;-amylase levels in cereal grains.  The key phenotype of interest in this thesis is LMA and different levels of expression of &#131;&#209;-amylase are a key feature of this phenotype.

Molecular markers and candidate genes were then used to screen two BAC libraries, one derived from the French cultivar, &#161;&#165;Renan&#161;&#166; and the other derived from Aegilops tauschii (the source of the D genome of wheat). About 300 BAC clones corresponding to the chromosome region of interest were obtained.  Of these, 8 BAC clones (6 chosen through hybridization to a GAMYB-like probe, and 2 from wheat ESTs anchored to the rice genome) were selected for sequencing, allowing for the development of new microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and for the discovery of novel transposable elements that provide a rich source of polymorphism for the development of additional markers.  Novel microsatellite and SNP markers that were identified from the BAC clone sequence were mapped on the Cranbrook/Halberd doubled haploid (DH) mapping population.  Markers were located to chromosomes 7AL, 7BL and 7DL.  New markers derived from the BAC sequence information were used to anchor the BAC clones to the genetic map and develop a framework physical-genetic map.  An automated annotation pipeline has been established and was used to annotate selected contigs of the sequenced BAC clones.

A new marker assisted selection strategy, termed Multiplex Trait Signature (MuTs) analysis, was developed and tested on 39 wheat cultivars of known LMA phenotype.  MuTs provides a graphical genotype of individuals for a particular chromosomal region and is a convenient tool for interrogating genetic similarity in the individuals surveyed.  Based on assays of 22 markers (12 spanning the LMA QTL on chromosome 7BL and 10 spanning the LMA QTL on chromosome 3BS) on these 39 wheat cultivars, it was found that the varieties can be grouped according to pedigree and provides a tool for interpreting LMA status for a variety.  Validation of the 7BL LMA and boron tolerance (Bo1) QTL regions was achieved using a targeted mapping approach using the doubled haploid population Pastor/RAC891 using published molecular markers and markers developed in this thesis.  The main outcome of this study is that the genomic organisation of this region on chromosome 7BL is complex, and that the identification of candidate genes in wheat controlling 1) tolerance of cultivars to boron toxic soils and 2) pathways regulating the expression of LMA, is likely to involve the interplay of a network of regulatory genes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">boron tolerance</field><field name="subject">late maturity alpha amylase</field><field name="subject">molecular markers</field><field name="subject">wheat genomics</field><field name="subject">rice</field><field name="subject">synteny</field><field name="subject">BACs</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070227.115505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fashioning the Executive (Look): Australian Women, Fashion and the rise of the New Work Order</field><field name="creator">A.Jones@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Fashion is not essential to completing an effective and productive day&#146;s work. Suits,
shoulder pads and power dressing are images and phrases that encircle working women
and are too often relegated to the empty cubicles of 1980s and 1990s history. The
proliferation of internet-mediated commerce meant &#150; in fictional narratives at least -
women swapped their Claiborne for geek chic and &#145;up all night&#146; hair, the preferential
wear for New Economy employees.1 In the 2000s, the Australian employment industry -
fractured, non-standard and fluid - is promoting a new &#145;creative&#146; work order. What are
the consequences of this transformation of ideology and iconography for workplace
dressing and the bodies of the women who wear it?

This doctoral thesis examines the relationship between fashion, clothes, women and
work. The goal and methodology of this thesis is the alignment of work theory, with
discourses of clothing and fashion, oral history, policy documents and popular culture.
Such a research project requires interdisciplinary scholarship that activates debates about
women&#146;s bodies, the state of the contemporary working environment and the dissonance
in literacies between body and workplace. Through the application of semiotic and
cultural studies, as well as drawing on theories of media, gender, labour, leisure, literacy
and fashion, I investigate the position of women and their bodies within the contemporary
Australian workplace.

This thesis deploys oral histories to illuminate how women function in the changing
Australian workplace. I have compiled these oral sources in order to capture specific
experiences and portray the successes and struggles that are faced by the women
employed in these sectors. The function of these histories in this thesis is to provide a
memory of, to and for working women, revealing many of the unspoken assumptions and
characteristics of the contemporary Australian workforce, such as the New Economy, an
increasing non-standard workforce, the myth of &#145;work/life balance,&#146; lifestyle, dissonant
bodies in the workplace, and the compartmentalization of work from other social function
including family life.

Within the nine chapters of this thesis, the research objective is to explore how women&#146;s
bodies are located within and negotiate the contemporary Australian workforce. It begins
with an examination of the conflation between &#145;self-help&#146; and feminist texts, to map the
troubled relationship between gender, power and the female body. The disparate
functions of dress and bodies are important focuses in this research. The use of oral
history, popular memory theory and the textual analysis of magazines is a way to
interrogate the role of women&#146;s bodies and fashion in history. The use of oral and popular
cultural sources is intentional. The goal is to develop an alternative system for
remembering bodies and clothing, with the aim of transforming their historical relevance.
The focal point of this thesis is assessing women&#146;s bodies and fashion in the workplace.
By evaluating contemporary trends in women&#146;s work attire, I expose the disparity in the
work clothes market in relation to quality, accessibility, functionality and price.

This doctoral thesis deploys work theory and the ideologies of the &#145;New&#146; and &#145;Old&#146;
Economy. Throughout this project, I trace the differences in workplace customs and
representations. The purpose of the thesis &#150; and indeed the original contribution to
knowledge &#150; is to demonstrate that women and men must be literate in not only the
workplace, but also in workplace clothing. Only when moving from everyday to
reflexive literacies can relevant models of discrimination and oppression within the &#145;New
Economy&#146; be revealed and addressed.

While presenting the voices and views of working women, this research proposes a
strategy for a change in education and the requirement of mentoring in relation to careers
and the &#145;new&#146; work order. The latter chapters are focussed on tracing working life in the
new knowledge economy within Australia. They explore the notion of &#145;supplementary&#146;
work in relation to &#145;lifestyle&#146; change and investigates the creative industries, the creative
class and ponders the dilemma of the creative industries in Australia. The objective of
this thesis is to not only to critique, but also to gather and deploy the words of women in
the contemporary workplace, as both inspiration and model for the strategies required to
instigate change. The final chapters capture a proactive desire to not only discuss
difference, but make a difference. The probing of dissonant literacies in the workplace
opens the tight and troubling relationship between women and bodies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070307.121413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extraordinary Undercurrents: Australian Cinema, Genre and the Everyday</field><field name="creator">davidthomas@arach.net.au</field><field name="description">&#145;Extraordinary Undercurrents: Australian Cinema, Genre and the Everyday&#146;
investigates how the critical uptake of genre-based cinema has been incorporated into
the cultural and industrial rubric of Australian national cinema. The thesis offers, in
part, a revaluation of theoretically under-emphasized texts (as well as texts that have
been the subject of much higher levels of scrutiny), in order to establish recurrent
threads within Australian cinema. In doing this, the thesis offers new and original
knowledge in the form of developing a perspective for a revised critical and
theoretical analysis of genre cinema within Australian cinema, challenging the
presumption of the kinds of texts that can be seen as articulating the nation. The
groups of films examined herein form nodes through which a network of important
and divergent ideas about nation, national identity and social organization come
together in the form of narrative and thematic undercurrents.

These (generally malevolent) undercurrents are articulated in the filmic representation
of a range of conventional personal, social and cultural dichotomies, and of particular
interest are the events, characters and narratives in which the everyday is confronted
by the abstract, abject and uncanny. The undercurrents I identify are shown as the
textual sites in which transgression - both inside and outside the frame - and
intertextuality are collocated, representing the convergence of material which
simultaneously operates outside of genres, while reinforcing textual similarity. The

The decline in Australia may be linked to concerns over perceived impacts of cat predation and an associated dislike of cats. However, while there are numerous studies on feral cats and their impacts on declining native fauna, the impact of pet cats on suburban wildlife or fauna in remnant bushland is relatively unknown although there is a wide perception of risk. The primary aim of this thesis was to apply the precautionary principle to the question of the putative impact of pet cats on the abundance and diversity of small mammals in urban bushland adjacent to low-density suburbia in the City of Armadale, a municipality on the south-east fringe of Perth, Western Australia. At the time of writing, Western Australia is yet to introduce state legislation governing cat control although many local councils within the state have either implemented or are in the process of implementing cat regulations.

The precautionary principle was deemed an ideal approach to this question, because it provides a rationale for deciding on possible actions where both the potential risk to environmental values and the uncertainty about possible impacts are high. In such cases the precautionary principle requires two broad lines of action: firstly, detailed consultation with stakeholders to determine their perceptions of risk and the actions they are prepared to take to reduce it and, secondly, research to reduce uncertainty.

With regard to stakeholder consultation, local residents were surveyed in regard to their attitudes and current cat husbandry practices. A substantial proportion of respondents within this municipality believed cat regulations were necessary (75% of owners and 95% of non-owners). At least 70% of both owners and non-owners agreed with the propositions that cats not owned by licensed breeders should be desexed, local councils should restrict the maximum number of cats that can be owned on one property and that pet cats entering nature reserves are harmful to wildlife. Most (c.85%) cat owners agreed that they would license their cats if that became compulsory. Although fewer owners (c.60%) were prepared to keep their cats on their property at all times to protect wildlife, over 80% were willing to confine their cats at night if it was required. Owners seemed to be substantially motivated by the value of these measures in reducing injury to cats and facilitating the return of lost animals rather than concern over wildlife protection.

Attempts to reduce uncertainty involved (i) assessing roaming patterns of pet cats to determine the sizes of appropriate buffer zones around nature reserves, and (ii) determining species diversity, species richness and abundance of small mammals in remnant bushland adjacent to sub-divisions with varying regulations governing cat husbandry. Radio tracking results to assess cat roaming patterns showed substantial variation in home range size between cats in high density suburbia (ranged between 0.01 ha &#150; 0.64 ha) and those in low density suburbia (ranged from 0.07 ha &#150; 2.86ha). Larger home range sizes of cats in the rural areas (up to 2.9 ha) suggest buffer zones of up to 500 metres around nature reserves are needed to exclude almost all roaming cats. The abundance and species richness of small mammals were investigated in four areas of remnant bushland. Two were adjacent to subdivisions where cat ownership was unrestricted, one next to a subdivision where cat ownership was prohibited and the remaining one next to a subdivision where compulsory night curfew and bells on pet cats were enforced. No definitive evidence of predatory impact by pet cats on the small mammals was found. Mammal species diversity was not significantly different between sites and species richness and absolute abundance were not higher in sites where cats were restricted. Vegetation comparisons showed significant differences in the structure and species composition of the vegetation between most sites and the mammal species richness and abundance appeared linked to ground cover density in the various sites. This factor, not cat restrictions, appeared to be the primary determinant of species richness, species diversity and absolute numbers of small mammals in these sites.

This study in the City of Armadale has shown that the implementation of proposed cat legislation must have a &#147;whole of ecosystem&#148; approach, i.e. protecting identified remnant bushland containing biodiversity from threatening processes such as plant disease and inappropriate fire, especially arson, as well as possible predations from pet cats. Habitat restoration and protection may be more important conservation activities than regulation of cats. Regulation of cats can be done at differing levels of intensity and cost, bearing in mind that this community is receptive to regulation of some aspects of cat ownership. Community education on the values of cat confinement in regards to cat welfare might increase chances of compliance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pet and domestic cats</field><field name="subject">felis catus</field><field name="subject">native mammals</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070316.204121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of ecclesiastical and community cultures on the development of Catholic education in Western Australia, 1846-1890</field><field name="creator">Eugene Mckenna</field><field name="description">Historians have generally tended to represent the pioneering Catholic mission in Western
Australia as an homogenous ecclesiastical entity with little cultural diversity. With a few notable
exceptions the nature of the Western Australian colonial Catholic mission is portrayed as a
'hibernised' form of Catholicism with an Irish clergy taking care of the pastoral needs of a
predominantly working class Irish Catholic constituency. This thesis challenges the traditional
paradigm as restrictive, and argues that it ignores significant contextual influences and veils the
wider cultural tapestry in which the Western Australian pioneering Catholic mission proceeded.

The traditional analysis of the internal dynamics of the Catholic mission implies that there
was a beneficial, almost symbiotic relationship between sympathetic bishops and their 'valiant
helpers.' Internal conflicts concerning administrative issues have been represented as little more
than mere personality clashes.

The thesis takes a more critical contextual approach and argues that the manifestation of
internal dissension during this period can only be fully explained by taking account of external
influences rather than local conditions. These influences include both Gallican and Ultramontane
ecclesiastical perspectives as well as the individual community cultures that were transported
from Europe to the Perth diocese by missionary personnel.

This new perspective corrects the more traditional approach which overlooked the different
ecclesiastical approaches, orientations and community cultures that were represented within the
colonial Catholic mission. This expansion of the existing interpretative paradigm through which
historians view the West Australian Catholic mission in general and the development of the
school system in particular marks a significant shifi in the existing historiography. As a
consequence, scholars will in future take a more critical approach to the study of not only the
Catholic education system but also the Western Australian Catholic mission in general. Rather
than representing the definitive closing chapter it is intended that this work will invigorate
renewed historical interest in the development of the Australian Catholic mission.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070326.142406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democracy and political economy of genetic engineering</field><field name="creator">dweston@ncwa.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to provide a more critical framework for the assessment of future technologies and therefore social directions and to help to bring an understanding to the relationship between global political economy, corporate power, ideology, science and technology.

Compared to the abundance of surveys that have examined Giardia and Cryptosporidium in terrestrial wildlife species, very few studies on either parasite have been undertaken on marine mammal species. Studies of shellfish, marine waters and water treatment plants clearly indicate that marine ecosystems are contaminated with Giardia and Cryptosporidium. In spite of these data the extent to which these parasites extend into the marine environment and how they may impact on marine mammal health remains largely unknown. The aim of this thesis was to expand our current knowledge of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in the marine environment and in particular, the harp and hooded seal populations of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada.

A large-scale serological survey of a large cohort of serum samples clearly show that, as is the case with terrestrial mammals, Giardia is ubiquitous in the marine environment. Sera positive for G. duodenalis-specific IgG were detected in almost all cetacean and pinniped species examined, and from all regions of the St. Lawrence estuary, Gulf of St. Lawrence and from the Canadian arctic.

In the case of harp and hooded seals, they are actively infected with Assemblage A, a zoonotic strain of G. duodenalis and represent a previously unrecognised contributor to the overall environmental parasite burden. The discovery of this variant of Giardia in a phocid host, along with their susceptibility to infection with terrestrial strains of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, highlight the potential zoonotic transmission from seals to humans through the consumption of uncooked intestines and general animal handling during research or hunting practices. The identification of this zoonotic strain of Giardia in seals also demonstrates the potential for anthropogenic activities such as human sewage treatment and agriculture runoff to be a significant source of contamination for marine mammals.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giardia</field><field name="subject">Pinnipedia</field><field name="subject">Cryptosporidium</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070327.152130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giardia and cryptosporidium infection in childcare centres in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Ann Walters Lymbery</field><field name="description">Giardia and Cryptospovidium are both recognised as important causes of infectious diarrhoea in children worldwide, and childcare centres have been shown to be a major site of infection. The incidence of infectious diarrhoea in children attending childcare centres has been estimated at between two to five times greater than in children cared for at home. Both Giardia and Cryptospovidium have a faecal-oral route of transmission that facilitates their spread in childcare environments, but can also be interrupted through the use of efficient hygiene protocols such as handwashing. Despite their importance as causes of infectious diarrhoea, there are no data on the prevalence or transmission dynamics of these parasites in Australian childcare centres.

The present study was designed to determine the prevalence and incidence of both Giardia and Ciyptosporidium in children attending childcare centres in Perth,Western Australia. Data were collected on asymptomatic infection, seasonal trends, the transmission dynamics of the parasites and risk factors for infection. The second part of the study involved the development, implementation and evaluation of a health intervention package designed to interrupt the transmission of causative organisms of infectious diarrhoea in childcare centres. This intervention was based on appropriate and effective handwashing.

Over a period of 23 months, 1 172 faecal samples were collected from non-toilet-trained children (n=306) attending 14 childcare centres in Perth, Western Australia. Where possible, family and contacts of infected children were also sampled to determine the dynamics of infection in the community. Information on syrnptomology of infections and risk factors for infection was obtained by the administration of a questionnaire to parents of all the children in the study.

Over all the childcare centres in the study, 7.8% of children were positive for Giardia and 10.8% were positive for Cryptosporidiunz. Of these, 37.5% of the Giardia-positive children returned positive samples on two to four occasions, but not always consecutively, suggesting either continuous or repeated infection with the parasite. Only 12% of children who were Cryptosporidiurn-positive were infected for two consecutive months.

The major findings of this study included a significant seasonal peak in the prevalence of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, with 50% of Giardia and 73% of Cryptosporidiurn infections occurring during the autumn months of March, April and May, and a high proportion of asymptomatic Giardia infections (45%), compared with only 13.5% of asymptomatic Cryptosporidiurn infections.

There was evidence for the transmission of both Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections to household contacts of infected children. Of the children who were found to be positive, faecal samples were also collected from 28 family members of those children with Giardia and from 14 family members of those with Cryptosporidiunz. Of these, 17.9% family members of the children with Giardia and 28.6% of family members of the Cryptosporidiuin children returned positive faecal samples. The only significant risk factor for Giardia infection was the number of adults living in the household, with infection more likely to occur in children who had a greater number of adults in the household. Significant risk factors for Clyptosporidium infection included the age of the child: the mean age of the positive children (20.6 months) was higher than in the negative children (16.6 months), and the length of time enrolled at the centre. Children who were positive had attended for a longer time than those who were negative (1 1.2 and 7.8 months respectively).

These results have important implications for the control of infection with these organisms, both within and beyond childcare centres. Since these parasites can be readily transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier, the high percentage of asymptomatic cases in this study, particularly of Giardia, strengthens the argument for health interventions which are directed at interrupting the trailsmission of the parasite.

A health intervention programme was developed that focused on handwashing procedures and was targeted at the carers, the children and the parents of the children in the centres. It was designed to be a low-cost programme both financially, and in the time and effort required to implement the programme within the childcare centre, to enhance compliance with the intervention. The success of the programme in changing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of carers was evaluated through a pre- and posttest questionnaire. This showed that the programme successfully improved the knowledge of the carers in the test centres in several important areas of infection control. These included knowledge about specific organisms causing infectious diarrhoea in childcare centres, transmission of these by asymptomatic individuals and increased knowledge about effective handwashing technique. Because it has been repeatedly shown that increased knowledge does not always translate into improved practices, and that interventions are not always successful in maintaining an improvement in the desired practices, a subjective evaluation was also performed. This was designed to determine how effective the intervention was perceived to be by the carers themselves, and whether they would continue to use the intervention over time. The results showed that the majority of the carers (&gt;88%) found the intervention appropriate and useful in teaching both the carers and the children within the centres, the importance of handwashing. Twelve months after the intervention had first been implemented, 57% of the centres in the study were still using the intervention at least once per month and a further 2996, while using it less than this, still continued to use it occasionally. This is important information, since an intervention can only be useful if it is actually being used.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryptosporidiosis</field><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070327.94029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taiwanese offshore (distant water) fisheries in Southeast Asia, 1936-1977</field><field name="creator">multilingual1024@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">The Japanese colonial fisheries authorities of pre-war Taiwan played an important role in the diffusion of offshore and distant water fishing methods. Two of the main fisheries in post-war Taiwan, the longline and trawl fisheries, were introduced from Japan during the pre-war period. Although Taiwan&#146;s fishing industry was devastated in the course of World War Two, with financial aid from the international community and the government&#146;s policy guidance, it was revived in a comparatively brief period of time. Fishing vessels from Taiwan, especially Kaohsiung, soon became, once again, a common sight in the waters of Southeast Asia. The first part of thesis traces the pre-war historical background, the government&#146;s post-war policy guidance and the birth of Taiwan&#146;s offshore and distant water fishing industry in Southeast Asia after World War Two.

After the Chinese communists came to power in 1949 Taiwan&#146;s fishing communities were placed under the strict surveillance of the Kuomintang authorities out of consideration for national security. The Taiwanese Government and the military adopted a variety of measures to control and regulate the development of the fishing communities. Also, the people in the fishing industry did their best to cope with the Government intervention.

To safeguard their onshore business interests, Kaohsiung&#146;s fishing companies also put considerable energy and effort into dealing with local shipyards, ice-manufacturers, and other fishing ancillary industries. Vessel owners developed industry partnership with those who were cooperative, and either avoided or boycotted those who were viewed as a potential nemesis. With a view to analysing the interactions between the fishing industry, the Government, the military, and key ancillary industries, the second part of the thesis focuses upon the history of Taiwan&#146;s post-war fishing industry from the perspective of the national-industrial level. 

The development of Kaohsiung&#146;s fishing industry was also deeply affected by ethnic factors. Siao Liouciou fishers were solely dedicated to the longline fishing method; Shandong people preferred to be involved in pair-trawl fishing. The final part of the thesis further narrows down the scope of the history of Taiwan&#146;s fishing industry to the local level context of the fishing communities. The histories of six fishing companies are used to compare the cultures and management styles of the trawling and longlining fisheries. Finally, the fishers&#146; daily lives in the waters of Southeast Asia, and the culture and routine practices of Kaohsiung&#146;s fishing communities are explored in depth.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Maritime History</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Fishing Industries</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070328.92412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Sojourn in Paris 1824&#150;25 Sex and Sociability in the Manuscript Writings of Anne Lister(1791&#150;1840)</field><field name="creator">Dannielle Orr</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the day to day practices that constituted Anne Lister&#146;s (1791&#150;1840) sexuality and sociability within the range of her writings, as well as her society. Anne&#146;s writings were a detailed account, spanning her lifetime, of her own love and relationships with the &#145;fairer sex&#146; (Whitbread 1988, 145). Anne&#146;s sociality, seen in her correspondence and plain handwritten journal entries, has been explored by Muriel Green in Miss Lister of Shibden Hall and Jill Liddington in Female Fortune and Nature&#146;s Domain (Green 1992; Liddington 1998; 2003). As a gentlewoman of adequate means, Anne has garnered some attention from women&#146;s historians interested in her agency within an early nineteenth century social and historical context. Anne&#146;s sexual identity has been extensively analysed over the past nearly twenty years by lesbian feminists, queer theorists, women&#146;s historians and historians of sexuality concerned with the history and development of modern Western female homosexuality and gender. The source for theorising Anne&#146;s sexuality has been the edited selections of the crypted journal entries, published by Helena Whitbread in I Know My Own Heart and No Priest but Love (Whitbread 1988; 1992). However, many analyses deal either with the theorisation of Anne&#146;s sexuality or her sociality; the theoretical difficulty with reconciling these categories has troubled the analysis of her complex subjectivity. Drawing upon the archival materials, I have used an interdisciplinary feminist approach to analyse the sexual and social processes of Anne&#146;s everyday interactions in her writings. Taking the seven month period of the sojourn to Paris in 1824&#150;25, I have focused upon Anne&#146;s textual practices within her journal volume and letters during her residence in Paris, her social practices with the other guests at the guesthouse 24 Place Vend&#244;me and her sexual practices with her lover, the widow Mrs. Maria Barlow. The journal volumes and correspondence are a valuable historical record of one gentlewoman&#146;s engagement with early nineteenth century British culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anne Lister</field><field name="subject">Lesbian</field><field name="subject">Feminists</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070329.132004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialoguing in the Desert for  Sustainable Development Ambivalence, Hybridity and Representations of Indigenous People</field><field name="creator">N.Mcgrath@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Sustainable development is becoming institutionalised across culture and geography as a framework in which to address ecological and social crises that are increasingly apparent and manifesting in diverse ways across local spaces. It is however, dominated by binary thought which is uncomfortable with ambivalence and seperates self from nature and &#145;the other&#146; of Indigenous people. Indigenous people are beginning to use the discourse of sustainable development but approach this from relational and holistic perspectives. The negotiation of representational structures and responsibility for implementating strategies towards sustainable development must account for these cultural differences and will require dialogue. This thesis explores how institutional practice and discourse frames Indigenous representation and responsibility and how this either enables or disenables dialogue with Indigenous people. 

A case study approach informed the research, and included two consultancy participatory projects in 2001-2004. The case study was located in the Western Desert of Western Australia and involved the Martu people in addition to people working within institutional structures. The first project required extending community development strategies and strengthening Martu representation to take responsibility for a housing development. The second project, titled Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman Tommorrow, involved encouraging Martu representation in a process based upon deliberative democracy. Reflections from the fieldwork form a considerable part of the analysis. The research also included analysis of a number of interviews with local institutional actors in Newman. Two major themes are outlined: power and representation; and culture. The research is reflexive and involves the use of an autoethnographic story technique which enables a better understanding of the researcher&#146;s implicit and changing perspectives. The lessons that emerged from the reflections from the case study are insightful for sustainable development.

The thesis involves two layers (and is structured accordingly): the first relates to a case study and the second to the theory and practice of sustainable development. The concluding section combines these two layers and emphasises the need for greater attention to Indigenous participation and autonomy in order to achieve Indigenous sustainable development. This thesis argues that diverse and hybrid Indigenous voices require considerable amplification within the discourse of sustainable development in order to provide relational and holistic perspectives. Particular focus is required upon the negotiation of representative structures to allow for Indigenous voices to be heard, and thus permit for the negotiation of responsibility across culture (an important consideration of sustainable development). This requires ongoing dialogue, creativity and reflexivity in context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">participating methods</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070329.132622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facing the Gorgon: Sustainability Assessment and Policy Learning in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">jennypope@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Sustainability assessment is emerging as a form of impact assessment with the concept of sustainability at its heart. This thesis contributes to the process of theory-building for sustainability assessment through an exploration of the development of this policy tool within the Western Australian context. Through an analysis of the sustainability assessments of the Gorgon gas development on Barrow Island and the South West Yarragadee water supply development, and a process of personal reflection, I explore the potential of sustainability assessment to contribute to a more sustainable society by facilitating learning. 
While the focus of traditional forms of impact assessment has typically been &#145;exterior&#146; forms of knowledge and learning relating to the potential impacts of a proposal, or to process methodologies and governance arrangements, in this thesis I argue that sustainability assessment processes should also facilitate &#145;interior&#146; forms of learning that excavate and challenge underpinning assumptions about the organisation of society, including shared discourses and storylines, as well as personal views and beliefs. 
To achieve this aim, I maintain that sustainability assessment should be a proactive process that is integrated with the proposal development, framed by an open question and guided by a &#145;sustainability decision-making protocol&#146; that operationalises sustainability for the decision at hand. It should be guided by a structured process framework that assures attention is given to issues that might otherwise be neglected. Each step of the process framework should represent a space for inclusive deliberation, with the concept of sustainability itself acting as a catalyst for learning and reflexivity.
Located within the institutions of modern industrial society, deliberative sustainability assessment processes can contribute to the emergence of an 'integral sustainability' that embraces and reconnects the interior and exterior, collective and individual dimensions of policy-making and of society in general. The influence of sustainability assessment can thus extend beyond the immediate decision at hand to contribute to a momentum for societal change towards a more sustainable future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability assessment</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">impact assessment</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">policy learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070330.154243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of Operational Tasks in Chemical Plants</field><field name="creator">m.nikraz@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The overall, coordinated management of different operational tasks in a chemical plant can improve operational efficiency. These operational tasks can be hierarchically categorised, from the lowest to highest level, as: data acquisition; regulatory control; monitoring; data reconciliation; fault detection and diagnosis; supervisory control; scheduling; and planning. Although each of these tasks is responsible for a particular function, they are dependent on each other, which is why an approach wherein all the different tasks can be integrated into a single unified framework is desirable. While integration has important benefits such as a significant reduction in operator workload and improved decision making, its realisation presents considerable challenges. Few previous works have addressed this topic and even fewer have investigated recent computing paradigms which may greatly assist in the development of a unifying framework.

Multi-agent systems were introduced and investigated in this study as a possible means for achieving integration of operational tasks in chemical plants. Multi-agent systems are the subject of a sub-field of computing research known as agent-based computing. Agent-based computing represents a relatively recent and powerful high-level computing paradigm.

Initially, a number of software applications were developed for the purposes of this study to assist realisation of the operational tasks. To simplify the process of system development and provide guidance for those unfamiliar with multi-agent systems wishing to adopt the proposed technique, an extensive methodology was devised. The operational tasks were then integrated using the proposed methodology to form an integrated multi-agent system, with the pilot plant at Murdoch University being used as a test base for the solution. The results were positive and demonstrated that the proposed agent-based solution was able to effectively account for the pilot plant setting. It was concluded that, in addition to presently available integration techniques and base technologies, the agent-based approach to integration of operational tasks in chemical plants presents a viable alternative solution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical plants</field><field name="subject">operational tasks</field><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070417.150114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student and teacher perceptions of preparation in mathematics in middle school and its impact on students' self-efficacy and performance in an upper secondary school in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Ronald.Aubrey@det.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Middle school initiatives (including heterogeneous classes and an integrated, flexible curriculum together with promotion of student input) have been implemented in schools in Western Australia in response to a perceived need to align schools more closely with a more student-centred approach to learning, in the expectation of meeting more students&#146; needs and thereby reducing student dissatisfaction and increasing the possibility of students pursuing life long learning. Specific goals underlying the initiative include the development of independent learning and student responsibility for learning through a series of strategies such as self-paced learning, student involvement in negotiating their own learning, and a strong emphasis on respecting and valuing student input into the implementation of curricula. However, owing to the way that the curricula for Middle and Upper secondary school mathematics are currently structured, problems might arise for students in the transition from &#147;a relaxed to a highly discipline-based organization of content&#148; (as described by Venville, Wallace, Rennie, Malone (1998). Students accustomed to the current approaches implemented in Middle schools (Years 8 to 10) may be disadvantaged in the transition to Upper secondary school courses (Years 11 and 12) compared with those students who have been exposed to a more discipline-based organization of content throughout early adolescence and prior to entry into courses leading to tertiary entrance (T.E.E. courses). The aim of this project was to investigate the possible effects of Middle school initiatives in a group of students from three Middle schools in Western Australia in one subject area &#150; mathematics &#150; on the perceptions of self-efficacy and preparation in mathematics once the students encounter Year 11 Upper school courses.

A survey containing Likert-type rating scales pertinent to four areas of interest &#150; Self-efficacy in mathematics; Self-Directed Regulation; Views on current teaching; and Views on prior teaching were administered to students transferring from three &#147;feeder&#148; Middle schools to Year 11 (Upper secondary school) classes in one Senior College in Western Australia for each of 4 consecutive years. Students were also asked for their comments regarding preparation for the challenges of their chosen courses in mathematics. In addition, their levels of performance in a range of mathematical skills were assessed using a teacher-developed test. The perceptions of their Middle and Senior School teachers were also sought. As the survey was administered to all students as a routine part of action research within the mathematics faculty at the Senior College, only the results of those students who subsequently agreed to be participants in the study are reported in this dissertation. Results indicated that a mismatch existed in approaches and skills between Middle School and Senior College Mathematics. The reliance on students making suitable choices for themselves, the absence of specialist teachers of mathematics in middle schools, mixed ability classes in which specialist teachers of mathematics find it difficult to operate successfully and a curriculum that was so flexible that teachers omitted key elements required for later studies were the main factors that resulted in a significant number of students making the transition from middle to senior school with insufficient preparation. Implications for the teaching of mathematics in these three Middle schools and the Upper school are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum Planning</field><field name="subject">Study</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070419.111054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing Learning Conversations: A Study of the Discourse and Learner Experiences of Online Synchronous Discussions</field><field name="creator">hlim@pi.ac.ae</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative case study is to gain greater insight into the impact of online synchronous (chat) interaction on the learning process from a sociocultural constructivist perspective in the context of an online undergraduate unit. Given the sparse research on the effectiveness of chat interaction in supporting knowledge construction processes, few appropriate analytical methods available for examining educational chat discourse, together with the pedagogical imperative to determine the extent to which the real-time computer-mediated communication (CMC) mode satisfies student learning needs, this study fills the gaps in current research by examining the impact of chat interaction in facilitating participation, knowledge construction, and quality of online learning experience of two different online tutorial groups.

Although the literature largely regards chat interaction as fragmented and characterized by interactional incoherence that disrupts the dialogic knowledge construction process, findings from this single-embedded case study of tutorial groups 1 and 4 (G1 and G4), involved in weekly critical discussions on set-readings over 11 weeks (one semester), show that chat interaction is more structured and complex than the literature suggests.

This study utilizes a new methodological design that integrates discourse and social network analytical methods which are triangulated with self-reports of learning experiences from an online survey instrument. The application of a refined Exchange Structure Analysis coding instrument (Kneser, Pilkington, &amp; Treasure-Jones, 2001) with social network analysis (Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000) to transcripts of chat interaction shows educational chat discourse to be coherent; reflecting the typical structure of pedagogical classroom exchanges. Findings from this study further establish that chat interaction enables participation opportunities in tutorial discussions which are valued as important, with variations in levels of participation within and between groups suggesting a pattern of active and peripheral participation which is not necessarily detrimental to learning. 

Chat interaction is also found to facilitate collaborative sharing of individual understandings and critical negotiation of meaning which are characteristic of the knowledge construction process, in the form of information-sharing and topic development phases in the exchanges of both groups. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to determine the exact form of knowledge constructed, individual and mutual appropriations of shared knowledge through chat interaction are reported by both groups. 

A between group comparison of available tutor scaffolding reveals consistently weak G1 tutor presence compared to strong G4 tutor support at the initial learning stages with gradual withdrawal of scaffolding over time. These results suggest differences in quality of online educational experiences which are confirmed by findings that compared to G1, G4 reported greater satisfaction with more chat tutorial factors; indicating an overall more positive, higher quality of experience with collaborative learning and group work processes afforded by the chat interaction.

With its methodological design, instruments, and findings, this study contributes to existing knowledge on online interaction, advances on previous studies regarding impact of chat interaction on learning, and offers directions for future work in the fields of educational technology, linguistics, and group dynamics in educational social networks. When extrapolated to comparable cases, findings from this study could guide the pedagogical design of collaborative-constructivist learning activities that takes into account the role of chat interaction in the construction of learning conversations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online synchronous communication</field><field name="subject">exchange structure analysis</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">social network analysis</field><field name="subject">e-learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070422.203120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intercultural relational development between Australian students and host Japanese students: A longitudinal study of students' socio-emotional experiences and interpretations</field><field name="creator">ujitani@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Since the &#147;Project of Accepting 100,000 Students from Abroad&#148; was proposed by the Japanese government in 1983, the number of international students in Japan has increased dramatically to reach ten times the level of 23 years ago. Yet, despite the enhanced opportunities for international and local Japanese students to interact, there is evidence that meaningful intercultural interactions between the two groups have not taken place consistently (Hicks, 1988; Jou &amp; Fukuda, 1995; Tanaka, et al., 1997).  

The aim of this research was to develop a better understanding of the process of intercultural relational development between international and Japanese students in a Japanese context. More specifically, the research aimed to identify elements which facilitate or inhibit the two groups' intercultural relational development over a period of time, the nature of socio-emotional challenges that are experienced along the way, and how these are interpreted by students themselves. Several interpersonal relationship theories, cross-cultural communication theory, and research on cross-cultural and intercultural relational development were reviewed to form the conceptual background of the research. In combination, they contributed to provide a holistic approach to studying the complex dynamic, interactive and reciprocal nature of intercultural relational development. 

Using naturalistic inquiry at a single site over a period of nine months, an empirical study investigated the intercultural relational development taking place among a small number of Australian and Japanese students who lived at the International House of a private Japanese university. Research methods included four semi-structured interviews with each participant, the use of various stimulus materials, including critical incidents to elicit multiple interpretations, as well as the researcher's continuous field observations. 

The study revealed some of the factors that facilitated and alternatively inhibited social interactions between the two groups, at different stages of their relational development. Students' spontaneous accounts of critical incidents, combined with their subjective interpretations of the same incidents provided insight into the socio-emotional challenges experienced by students in the process of intercultural relational development. Whereas most students' accounts and interpretations could be related to cultural background and experience, there was also evidence that some strategies for developing intercultural relationships as well as some interpretations of socio-emotional challenges were related to gender rather than cultural background. Unexpectedly, the research also found that social drinking was perceived by many students, across the two groups, as a facilitating factor at the early stage of intercultural development. 

Overall, the empirical study revealed that Japanese students experienced more socio-emotional challenges than Australian students. Differences in sense of humor and in perceived appropriateness of introducing conversational topics of a private nature were given special attention as these appeared to present major socio-emotional challenges for Japanese students. Both cultural background and gender seemed to have an impact on students' interpretations of these challenges. 

The thesis concludes with some suggestions for future research and for how intercultural learning between international students and host nationals could be enhanced in the Japanese context. Finally, the study makes a unique methodological contribution to research related to international students, through the use of a longitudinal design, a focus on situated experiences and socio-emotional challenges, and more generally, through a reciprocal approach to the study of intercultural relational development in the context of the internationalisation of higher education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural</field><field name="subject">relational development</field><field name="subject">international students</field><field name="subject">Japanese higher education</field><field name="subject">socio-emotional challenge</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070423.145945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence, severity and possible causes of canker disease of Corymbia calophylla (marri) in the southwest of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">t.paap@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The impact of a canker disease of Corymbia calophylla (marri) in the southwest of Western Australia (WA) has increased substantially since it was first observed causing decline and death of this species in the 1970s. By the early 1990s there were expressions of concern and calls to determine the cause and management options. Despite this, there has been very little research into the incidence, severity and possible causes of the disease. There are,
however, historical reports dating back to the 1920s of a canker disease of amenity planted C. ficifolia caused by Sporotrichum destructor, though the diagnosis and Latin description were never published. It has been suggested that there may be links between this species and the genus Quambalaria, a group containing leaf and shoot pathogens of species of Eucalyptus and Corymbia.

This study examined the incidence and symptomology of the disease, the range of fungal species associated with healthy and diseased C. calophylla, and the pathogenicity of
isolates obtained from these surveys. Also investigated was the identity of the pathogen, S. destructor, historically attributed to canker disease of C. ficifolia, to determine whether this pathogen is responsible for the current epidemic of C. calophylla canker and if it is synonymous with Quambalaria.

Cankers were present on trees across the range of surveyed sites, with lesions occurring on trunks, branches or twigs of 25.7 % of the C. calophylla surveyed. Canker incidence was significantly greater on trees present at remnant sites, such as roadsides and in paddocks, than forest trees being 38 % and 13.3 %, respectively. Tree height, trunk diameter at breast height and crown position, size and health ratings were significant predictors of canker
presence, with cankers more common on larger, older trees and trees with poor crown condition. Bark cracks exuding kino were present on 48 % of the surveyed trees, and when
dissected, lesions were observed on 40 %, suggesting that these cracks could be the initial stages of canker disease. This was confirmed by the observation of a number of cracks that developed into perennial cankers during the three year study. Monitoring of canker development and the examination of transverse sections showed the circumvention of host
defenses by the pathogen and the subsequential walling off response of the host (which typifies perennial cankers) was not necessarily an annual event, with no change observed in
some cankers over the three year period, while others progressed rapidly in that time, occasionally to the point of girdling and killing the host.

Initial surveys isolated 44 fungal species from healthy and diseased C. calophylla, with opportunistic pathogens including Endothiella eucalypti and Cytospora eucalypticola
common. Subsequent surveys foccussed more on a potential pathogen in the genus Quambalaria, which was rarely isolated from active lesions, presumably because of its
slow growth rate, but which sporulated consistently on the surface of older sections of the cankers.

DNA sequences confirmed that Q. cyanescens and Q. pitereka are present in southwest WA, with the latter associated with leaf and shoot disease. A third and new species of
Quambalaria was isolated from cankers. Comparisons of disease symptoms and conidiogenesis indicate this species is synonymous with S. destructor. The species is
formally described here as Q. coyrecup T. Paap sp. nov.

A pathogenicity trial was unsuccessful in causing disease symptoms in trees inoculated with core plugs taken from canker lesion margins of diseased trees, though the time frame and environmental factors may not have been adequate for disease development. The core plug inoculation method may also have failed because opportunistic pathogens which were frequently isolated from lesions out-competed Q. coyrecup (paralleling the results achieved by culturing from lesions). Quambalaria coyrecup caused symptoms matching those observed in natural infections when suitable hosts were inoculated, confirming it is the fungus responsible for the current canker disease of C. calophylla and C. ficifolia. Endothiella eucalypti also caused
significant lesions, though these were not typical of natural infections, which together with its frequent isolation from both healthy and diseased trees suggests it is an opportunistic pathogen, potentially contributing to disease development in trees already infected with Q.
coyrecup.

Isolates of Q. pitereka from WA and eastern Australia both caused typical shoot blight symptoms in the WA hosts C. calophylla and C. ficifolia, and the eastern Australian host
C. maculata, though a larger path trial is required to examine the possibility of host specificity. Quambalaria cyanescens was non-pathogenic in all inoculation trials.

The current cause of cankers in C. calophylla is now known to be the same as the fungus historically implicated in the canker disease of C. ficifolia, when at the time it was
described as an endophyte doing little or no damage in C. calophylla. Thus, it is of immediate importance to determine the factors driving this decline, and develop control and management options.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">tree disease</field><field name="subject">Microstromatales</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070423.152657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Malaysian State and the Regulation of Labour: From Colonial Economy to K-Economy</field><field name="creator">d.turner@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the state-labour nexus emerging out of the processes through which governing authorities have attempted to maintain or regain political stability and rates of accumulation in Malay(a)sia. Existing studies usefully highlight the extent to which repressive industrial relations legislation and ethnic communalism have weakened the trade union movement and segmented the labour force delivering the relative industrial peace attractive to foreign investors. Some suggest labour&#146;s discontent at this repression has been successfully contained by Malaysia&#146;s relatively strong economic performance. These approaches, however, only partially acknowledge the extent to which labour&#146;s social reproduction under capitalist relations generates political and economic contradictions. 

After an initial failure to address these contradictions in the early post-colonial era, the Malay-dominated government has since developed avenues through which to deliver economic and cultural concessions in a selective and paternalistic fashion. This economic paternalism has contributed to social stability but has diverted funds from economic development and now runs contrary to structural reforms that seek to address Malaysia&#146;s declining international competitiveness. The transition towards a knowledge-based economy, referred to locally as the k-economy, therefore embodies efforts by the political elite to contain political and societal tensions emerging out of the reform process. This thesis demonstrates and analyses the dynamic, contingent and uneven nature of these efforts as the government seeks to establish new bases of legitimacy more closely linked to household consumption concerns than ethnicity. Despite the relative absence of industrial disputation, labour&#146;s location in Malaysia&#146;s system of capitalism remains a contradictory one. Politically motivated social policies, although under pressure and likely to take new forms, will nonetheless remain pivotal in the attempt to resolve the tensions that threaten accumulation and political stability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">regulation theory</field><field name="subject">knowledge-based economy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070424.111203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Olive Branch for Sante (A novel) ; and The Italian Diaspora in Australia and Representations of Italy and Italians in Australian Narrative</field><field name="creator">Casella2@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This PhD presentation comprises two pieces of work:

The Italian Diaspora in Australia and Representations of Italy and Italians in Australian Narrative ( Research thesis)

An Olive Branch for Sante (A novel)
&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.
In the Introduction of my research titled: Diaspora: A Theoretical Review, I look at the evolution of diasporic Studies and how the great movements of people that have occurred in the past one hundred and fifty years have altered our perception of what is undoubtedly a global phenomenon.
In Chapter One, which I have titled: In Search of an Italian Diaspora in Australia, I consider the kinds of socio-cultural nuclei that have evolved among the Italian population of Australia, out of the mass migration which occurred largely in the post war years. I discuss Italian migration as a whole, the historical and political conditions which brought about mass migration and the subsequent dispersion of Italian nationals, their regrouping into various clusters and how these fit into the patchwork that is the contemporary Australian society. Finally I review the conditions in the host country which facilitated or hindered particular socio-cultural formations and how these may differ from those occurring in other countries
Chapter Two deals with, The Narrative of Non-Italian Writers. The chapter looks at the images and myths of Italy perpetrated in the literature written by English-speaking authors over the centuries. I begin with the legacy left by British writers such as E.M. Forster, then move on to Australian writers of non-Italian background, such as Judah Waten, Nino Culotta (John O' Grady) and Helen Garner. In Chapter Three: Italo-Australian Writers, I focus on two writers: Venero Armanno and Melina Marchetta, both born in Australia of Italian parents. This section ties in with the earlier discourse on the continuity of the Italian Diaspora in Australia, into the second and subsequent generations.
In Chapter Four, titled: Literature of Nostalgia: The Long Journey, I will reflect upon my own journey as a writer, beginning with my earlier work, including the short stories and the plays, and concluding with a close look at the present novel, which is a companion piece to the research.
The novel complements the research in that it deals with the eternal issues of migration: displacement, change and identity. The protagonists are two young people: Ira-Jane and Sante. The first is not a migrant, but she is touched by migration, insofar as an old Italian couple play grandparents to her, in the early years of her life. When they return to Sicily the child is left with her neglectful and unstable mother. At age twenty-four Ira-Jane goes to Sicily on an assignment, and there she tries to get in touch with her 'grandparents'. She meets up with eighteen-year-old Sante who turns out to be her half brother. The novel's structure juxtaposes two countries, two cultures, two way of looking at the world. It sets up a series of contrasts: the old society and the new, past and present, tradition and innovation, stability and change, repression and freedom. The end of the novel proposes a symbolic bridging between two countries, which are similar in some ways, very different in others. It offers not a solution but a different approach to the eternal dilemma of people living in a diaspora, inhabiting an indefinite space between two countries and for whom home will always be somewhere else.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Italian</field><field name="subject">Australian Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070427.120048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specialist Teachers and Curriculum Reform in a Western Australian Primary School in 2002 A Comparative Study of Specialist Music, Health and Physical Education, and Languages-Other-Than-English Teaching Professionals</field><field name="creator">fino@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis details research on the first phase of curriculum reform (1999&#150;2004) in a
government primary school in Western Australia. The purpose of the study was to
examine what progress had been made with the implementation of the Curriculum
Framework (1998). The research focussed on Music, Health and Physical Education,
and Languages Other than English as specialist teachers working with the
Curriculum Framework (1998). Teachers and school administrators, as frontline
practitioners, considered their experiences and perceptions of daily practice and
provided their perspectives on curriculum reform.

The hypothesis formulated for the study was that with the introduction of the
Curriculum Framework (1998) the delivery of these three subjects could be further
improved. This study argues that successful curriculum performance of these three
subjects traditionally considered &#147;specialist programs&#148; may be more fully supported
by becoming aware of the forces influencing Australian curriculum discourse and
delivery. Subject knowledge endorsement in this study refers to the transfer of valued
knowledge in Western Australian educational systems. It is proposed that if teaching
professionals articulated the substance of their educational beliefs and experiences
with regard to subject knowledge meaning, place and value, curriculum delivery in
primary schools may progress more effectively. Positive learning experiences for all
students can be provided through the encouragement of communication and
collegiality together with relevant and accessible professional development. These
measures can also be supported by mounting whole-school primary programs that
engage with beliefs about Music, Health and Physical Education, and Languages
Other Than English through collaborative networks and learning communities.
Accordingly, curriculum delivery can come within reach of the seamless curriculum
anticipated by reform (Curriculum Framework, 1998:6&#150;7).

In this qualitative interview study, the frontline participants included generalist
teachers, specialist teachers and school administrators. These educational
practitioners were asked to participate in an in-depth, semi-structured discussion that
explored their perceptions of specialist teaching and knowledge while employed at
Deep Sea Primary School in 2002.
They teachers also commented on how these perceptions may be linked to their
experiences of socially constructed and established notions of valued knowledge.

The findings of this study indicated that the progressive implementation of these
three subjects or specialist&#146;s areas were characterised by subtle historical, economic,
political and social forces. This thesis suggests that, these largely obscured external
forces together with individual yet, taken for granted perceptions of what is
perceived as valuable knowledge work together to position curriculum rhetoric and
curriculum enactment that reflect established perceptions of the knowledge
hierarchy. Teachers and administrators at the school often operated within the
structures and meanings of conventional teaching practice of subject knowledge as
determined by dominant culture in Australia. The findings indicated that school
culture in a time of reform re-traditionalised hierarchical patterns of subject
knowledge organisation and evaluation. Accordingly, current subject knowledge
endorsement in terms of specialist teaching often worked to the benefit of established
power relationships typical of post-industrial market economy in Australia.

The findings also indicated that issues pertaining to curriculum prioritisation were
influenced by institutional, group and individual experiences of subject specialist
knowledge. Poor perceptions of these three subjects could also be generated by
experiencing inflexible and inadequate yet established funding and resource patterns
in educational systems. Frontline teachers, their school-based roles and
responsibilities attached to the teaching and learning of the three specialist areas
were typified by rigid school organisation and job structures together with condensed
teaching time and community backing.

This thesis argues that progressive, outcomes education requires an articulate and
supportive school culture, more funding and the genuine maintenance of quality
Music, Health and Physical Education and Language Other Than English teachers. In
addition, curriculum implementation would benefit from the promotion of
constructivist-orientated student activities within specialist programs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary Teachers</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Health and Physical Education</field><field name="subject">Languages other than English</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070427.125141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A different kind of &#145;subject:&#146; Aboriginal legal status and colonial law in Western Australia, 1829 -1861.</field><field name="creator">Ahunter@echidna.id.au</field><field name="description">A different kind of &#145;subject:&#146; Aboriginal legal status and colonial law
in Western Australia, 1829-1861.
This thesis is an examination of the nature and application of the policy regarding the
legal status and rights of Aboriginal people in Western Australia from 1829 to 1861. It
describes the extent of the debates and the role of British law that arose after conflict
between Aboriginal people and settlers in the context of political and economic contests
between settlers and government on land issues. While the British government
continually maintained that the legal basis for annexation was settlement, by the mid
1830s Stirling regarded it as an &#145;invasion,&#146; but was neither prepared to accept that
Aboriginal people had to consent to the imposition of British law upon them, nor to
formally recognise their rights as the original owners of the land. Instead, Stirling&#146;s
government applied an archaic form of outlawry to Aboriginal people who resisted the
invasion. This was despite proposals for agreements in the 1830s.

During the early 1840s there was a temporary legal pluralism in Western Australia
where Indigenous laws were officially recognised. However, by the mid 1840s the
administration of British law in Western Australia was increasingly dictated by settler
interests and mounting settler-magistrate pressure to modify the legal position of
Aboriginal people which resulted in the development of colonial law to construct a
landless subject status with minimal rights based on their value as a useful labour force
for the pastoral economy. This separate legal status deliberately departed from
&#145;equality&#146; principles and corresponded with the diminished status of Indigenous laws
and the abandonment of legal pluralism in settled districts, during a period of rapid
pastoral expansion in the 1850s. This entrenched discriminatory practice in colonial law
would be the prelude to the &#145;protectionist&#146; and discriminatory legislation of the early
twentieth century which formalised inequality of legal status.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal legal status</field><field name="subject">clonial legal history</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070427.125700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problem solving policing in the police service of Western Australia: the impact of organizational structure and culture</field><field name="creator">Billboaks@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">In 1996 the Police Service of Western Australia embarked on a major and ongoing period of change regarding all aspects of local policing. Part of this program involved the adoption of a number of practices that included an undertaking to pay increased attention to issues such as a customer focus, problem solving, a commitment to developing and motivating personnel, a localised delivery of policing services and improved management practices. 

This research was conducted for the purpose of uncovering the factors that create the unique environment of the Police Service of Western Australia and exploring how these might impact upon the manner in which officers conduct their daily duties. More specifically the purpose was to determine if there existed any aspects of organizational culture or structure that have an influence on the ability and/or willingness of officers to carry out their duties according to the processes and procedures of either the problem solving or the problem-oriented policing philosophy. 

The research methodology was guided by the grounded theory approach. Twenty-eight interviews were conducted with constables, sergeants, inspectors and superintendents as it was considered that these ranks best represented the views of the members of the organization in terms of numbers and those most affected by day-to-day events.

The data analysis revealed the existence of 13 factors that all exhibit negative aspects and collectively create a Basic Social Problem that has been termed &#147;Feeling Vulnerable&#148;. Although all of these factors have been well known for many years, the current research integrates these in a new way in order to produce a model of the organization that demonstrates how they combine to create an environment that is counter-productive to the implementation of a problem-solving or problem-oriented approach to policing by members of The Police Service of Western Australia at many levels.

The Basic Social Process disclosed by the current research has been termed &#147;Controlling By Avoidance&#148;. It is based on four tactics used by officers to control their working environment. The employment of one or more of these tactics by officers is designed to give the impression of engaging with issues while simultaneously exerting control over events in order to prevent the occurrence of outcomes that experience tells them are likely to have undesirable personal consequences. The intention is to create an environment where they hope to be safe from the consequences of problems that will inevitably occur at some time.

As well as providing an explanation for the conduct of officers under the problem solving model the analysis also provides an insight into why the organization has apparently avoided coming to grips with the implementation of the full Goldstein model of problem-oriented policing. This appears to be due to concerns on the part of senior management about the likelihood of a loss of control over subordinate ranks and the personal problems that this would generate for them.

Recommendations are made about the need to adopt the Goldstein model and the steps required to successfully implement this approach are listed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem Solving</field><field name="subject">Police Force</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070427.130725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reform of Minor Cannabis Laws in Western Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">gswensen@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The past three decades has been a period of intense and sustained debate in a number of major Western countries about the wisdom of police continuing to apply legislation which can severely punish offenders by fines and even imprisonment because of laws and policies that prohibit the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis.

The large and growing number of young adults who have been exposed to the drug, some of whom have been charged and received criminal convictions with attendant deleterious effects on their employment and wellbeing, has forced policy makers to re-evaluate the justification for continuing to criminalise cannabis. 

This thesis examines in detail the law reforms that occurred in early 2004 with respect to cannabis offenders in Western Australia (WA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and what lessons these reforms may hold for other jurisdictions interested in decriminalisation of minor cannabis offences. 

A study was undertaken to compare the shortcomings and advantages of the different approaches to reform followed in WA and the UK. Reference to the reform in the UK, will be confined to meaning England, Wales and Northern Ireland as the necessary administrative guidelines have not so far been issued for Scotland. 

In WA the reforms required a substantial legislative effort to establish a complex framework that outlined in detail the circumstances when police may issue cannabis infringement notices (CINs), whereas in the UK the approach involved limited legislative activity by the reclassification of the legal status of cannabis and by providing police with administrative guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Commissioners as to how to exercise their discretion in issuing formal warnings for a minor cannabis offence. 

A comparison is made with New Zealand (NZ), where in spite of  there being a similar process of deliberation and consultation as in WA and the UK, the government refused to implement formal reform because of a perception it was unable to decriminalise minor cannabis offences because of the restrictions imposed of agreement between the Clarke Labour Government and a minor political party. 

The example of the failure of government in NZ to achieve reform illustrates the importance that in some jurisdictions there will be a significant role for non parliamentary advisory bodies and lobby groups to argue for reform and to garner public support when reform has stalled or been frustrated.

The thesis also includes a preliminary exploratory study using a number of indicators, such as prevalence and conviction data, to determine if the reforms implemented by the CIN scheme have resulted in or are likely to create unanticipated harms and to explore some of the issues in being to determine whether changes in law enforcement practices and priorities have impacted on the cannabis market or are likely to change the way cannabis may be transacted in WA.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070507.150143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards eradication of SPAM : a study on intelligent adaptive SPAM filters</field><field name="creator">t.hassan@aic.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">As the massive increase of electronic mail (email) usage continues, SPAM (unsolicited bulk email), has continued to grow because it is a very inexpensive method of advertising. These unwanted emails can cause a serious problem by filling up the email inbox and thereby leaving no space for legitimate emails to pass through. Currently the only defense against SPAM is the use of SPAM filters. A novel SPAM filter GetEmail5 along with the design rationale, is described in this thesis. To test the efficacy of GetEmail5 SPAM filter, an experimental setup was created and 
a commercial bulk email program was used to send SPAM and non-SPAM emails to test the new SPAM filter. 

GetEmail5&#146;s efficiency and ability to detect SPAM was compared against two highly ranked commercial SPAM filters on different sets of emails, these included all SPAM, non-SPAM, and mixed emails, also text and HTML emails.

The results showed the superiority of GetEmail5 compared to the two commercial SPAM filters in detecting SPAM emails and reducing the user&#146;s involvement in categorizing the incoming emails.  

This thesis demonstrates the design rationale for GetEmail5 and also its greater effectiveness in comparison with the commercial SPAM filters tested.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spam filtering</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070507.160250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing megacities : a case study of metroplitan regional governance for Dhaka</field><field name="creator">s.talukder@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Megacities of over 10 million population are a phenomenon not seen before in human
history. Among 19 Megacities, 14 are in developing countries and 11 are in Asia. Dhaka
represents one of the most extreme examples of rapid Megacity growth having a mere
129,000 at the start of the 20th century, 417,000 by 1950 and more than 12 million in
2001.

How can a city be governed that has increased 30 times in size over a person&#146;s lifetime?
This thesis makes a case for integrated Metropolitan Regional Governance (MRG) of the
Extended Metropolitan Region of Dhaka.

The growing problems of Asian Megacities in general and Dhaka in particular are
outlined, showing how governance has developed in a sectoral and national way rather
than being place oriented. This has fractured and become totally inadequate as a means
of solving the deep environmental, social and economic problems of the Megacity.

The governance issues of Megacities are traced to the primary problem of the need for
integrative functions in strategic and statutory planning as well as development
facilitation of the Extended Metropolitan Region (EMR). Ten core principles of
Metropolitan Regional Governance are established. Without this, the Megacity&#146;s
functions of infrastructure, investment, housing, environmental management,
employment etc. are not coordinated or prioritised in ways that lead to &#145;common good&#146;
sustainability outcomes.

The ten principles are applied to four Asian Megacities &#150; Metro-Manila, Tokyo, Bangkok
and Jakarta &#150; to confirm their relevance and application before applying them to Dhaka.

The problems of Dhaka are outlined then an analysis of Dhaka governance options is
attempted based on the ten core principles of MRG. Four possibilities are analysed and
a way forward is suggested combining the options.

The proposed structure will build on the present system with greater responsibilities for
strategic planning, statutory planning and development facilitation. It will also build up
municipalities through a more transparent and engaged local planning process and create
partnerships for infrastructure development.

The proposed governance structure would use the dynamism of the Megacity to create
sustainable solutions and hope for the future of the city. The key to implementation will
be finding the political solution to make such painful change, and training professionals
in the broad integrative skills of urban sustainability and community engagement that are
required for the region as well as the participation and partnership skills at local level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cities and towns</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">Dhaka</field><field name="subject">Urban policy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070508.145238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The thermodynamic chemistry of the aqueous copper-ammonia thiosulfate system</field><field name="creator">sblack@ccwa.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">A fundamental thermodynamic study was undertaken in order to establish the speciation of copper(I) and copper(II) during the leaching and recovery of gold from thiosulfate-copper-ammonia solutions. Despite considerable research into this complex leaching system, the lack of important fundamental chemistry has delayed the implementation of the thiosulfate process as an alternative to cyanidation. Over the last two decades, research in this field has focused on the kinetics and electrochemistry of leaching, which involves the use of copper(II) as an oxidant. However, the fundamental thermodynamic data for copper(I) and copper(II) in this system is limited.

Ion association was found to significantly affect the dissociation constant of the ammonium ion in solutions containing sodium sulfate and/or sodium thiosulfate, thus influencing the free ammonia concentration in solution. These findings highlight the importance of using the correct dissociation constant value in thermodynamic studies that involve ammonia in order to obtain precise stability constants.

It has been established that the mixed-ligand complexes Cu(NH3)(S2O3)23- and Cu(NH3)(S2O3)- exist in solution and they are more stable than the other species Cu(S2O3)35-, Cu(NH3)2+ and Cu(NH3)3+ at high concentrations of ammonia and/or thiosulfate. The relative proportions of each two species is dependant on the [NH3]:[S2O32-] ratio in solution. This is reflected in two- and three- dimensional speciation diagrams that have been constructed for typical leaching and recovery processes using the stability constants obtained in this study. The 3-dimensional diagrams reveal subtle speciation trends that are not easily discernable from the 2-dimensional diagrams.

An investigation into the effect of high sulfate and chloride concentrations showed that these anions are not involved in the complexation with copper(I)-ammonia or copper(I)-ammonia-thiosulfate species under the experimental conditions studied. However, these anions and perchlorate formed relatively stable species with the copper(II)-ammine complexes in the absence of thiosulfate. Stability constants were obtained for the species Cu(NH3)4SO40, Cu(NH3)4Cl+ and Cu(NH3)4ClO4+ and it is suggested that these anionic ligands form outer-sphere complexes with the Cu(NH3)42+ ion.

Various methods of predicting stability constants for mixed-ligand complexes from those for the corresponding single ligand systems have been evaluated for this copper(I) system. Although the results have not been quantitatively accurate, the trends suggest that an appropriate method may serve as a useful qualitative tool to predict the possible existence of mixed-ligand complexes.

The combined application of 2- and 3-dimensional speciation and potential diagrams could be used as a hydrometallurgical tool in the design, optimization and control of possible future processes for the extraction of gold using thiosulfate in the presence of copper ions and ammonia. The work presented in this thesis adds to our understanding of the chemistry of copper(I) and copper(II) in this leaching system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Thiosulphates</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070508.154242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-cultural aspects of reading practices : a longitudinal study of Thai and Indian/Bangladeshi postgraduate students' metacognitive and framing abilities when reading at an Australian university</field><field name="creator">joysi@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">This research aimed at understanding the reading practices of two groups of
international postgraduate students across three semesters. The research was
underpinned by a conceptual framework incorporating metacognitive concepts with

and pair think-alouds followed by retrospective interviews using general-interest
texts. The interviews and pair think-alouds took place at an Australian university with
Thai and IndianBangladeshi postgraduate students and at university campuses in
Thailand and India.

The data selected from the interviews and pair think-alouds revealed significant
changes in reading practices between first and third semester at an Australian
university and the participants' awareness of these changes. The participants'
reflections also provided some explanation for the differences in their cognitive and
metacognitive strategy use.

The research study was important because, at the postgraduate level, students are
faced with complex text interpretation processes. International students, in addition,
have to make a significant cultural/study shift; not only do they have to become accustomed to the reading of academic texts using discipline-specific patterns but
often have to adjust to different conventions used by authors from cultural
backgrounds other than their own. Little is known, in particular, about Thai and
Indianmangladeshi postgraduate students' reading experiences in their own countries
or how their reading practices change during study at an Australian university.

The research findings suggest a dynamic, multi-dimensional, developmental
framework for conceptualising international postgraduate students' reading practices
in first semester at an Australian university, and the changes in reading practices and
the educational and socio-cultural influences on these changes by third semester; the
findings, in addition, can inform the debate on literacy levels in the cross-cultural
academic environment and can contribute to discussions on such pedagogical issues
as reforming of curricular structure, the internationalisation of curricula and the
development of more culturally sensitive supervisory frameworks.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai students</field><field name="subject">Reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070509.131040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rights of Malaysia's ethnic minorities : is democracy dead?</field><field name="creator">Tania Jeyamohan</field><field name="description">synopsis
This dissertation examines the erosion of minority rights in Malaysia through the
implementation of special measures in favour of the majority Malays. This dissertation
will consider the appropriateness, effectiveness and legitimacy of these special
measures under cunent international law standards. This involves a comparison of
Malaysia's constitutional, legislative and statutory provisions with international
principles of customary and treaty law, and applicable regional declarations. This
dissertation will conclude by recommending appropriate policy and legislative reform,
if such measures are found to be appropriate in the circumstances.

Preamble
Malaysia achieved independence fiom Britain on 31 August 1957. The Merdeka
Independence Proclamation declared that the nation was to be 'founded upon the
principle of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of its people'.
Insightful words for a nation built upon by racial, cultural and religious separatism, as
the term 'its people' was presumably meant to encompass both the majority Malays as
well as all ethnic minorities.' Unfortunately, the sentiment expressed in the Merdeka
proclamation was marred by ethnic polarisation and its resultant ethnocentric legal and
political system.

The reasons for this will be explored in chapter one, which considers Malaysia's
historical and cultural development and the eventual mass pluralisation of Malaysia
without a unifying national identity. An understanding of the formation of Malaysia's
cultural hegemony, and its subsequent ethnic polarisation, is required to appreciate the
current status of Malaysia's ethnic minorities. Part A will consider in detail the
preferential policies in favour of Malays introduced by the government following the
1969 race riots and the resulting effect this had on the economic, social and cultural
rights of non-Malays. The introduction of these policies also led to the implementation
of race based quota systems in the education, employment and business sectors.
Correspondingly, the socio-economic position of non-Malay minorities have been
affected. The legal implications of these policies are discussed in the proceeding
chapters and the reasonableness of these policies will be measured against international
law standards.

To undertake this assessment, Part B discusses the role of international law and
examines its implications to Malaysia. It should be noted fiom the outset that although
Malaysia is a member State of the United Nations, it has elected not to ratify significant
human rights treaties. Given this, chapter two considers the role of customary law as a
part of international law and its implications to the observance of fundamental human
rights. This chapter aims to establish that Malaysia as a member of the United Nations,
and by virtue of customary law, is bound to recognise fundamental human rights.

As this dissertation discusses Malaysia's observance of minority rights at international
law, part C examines the availability of fundamental human rights to Malaysia's
minorities. Part C reconciles Malaysia's pro-Malay preferential policies with minority
rights and considers whether minority rights in Malaysia have been eroded through such policies pursuant to international law standards. Chapter four determines whether the
language rights of Malaysia's non-bahasa speakers, who also constitute the ethnic
minorities, are recognised and protected by Malaysia's national language policy. This
chapter also assesses the impact of Malaysia's national language policy and planning on
the education and employment rights of non-Malays given the introduction of language
based quota systems in both sectors. Chapter five examines the role of Islam in
Malaysia and considers the extent of religious freedom available to non-Muslims in
Malaysia Chapter six deals with Malaysia's restrictive laws and how these laws were
relied on to revise and modify Malaysia's legal system and policies to benefit Malays
whilst simultaneously impacting on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural
rights of non-Malay minorities. Chapter six also considers the potential risks associated
with the government's continued reliance on these restrictive laws to 'control' interethnic
tensions.

On the assumption that Malaysia has breached relevant international law standards in
some instances, part D recommends possible methods of legislative and policy reform
which may be adopted by the government to remedy these breaches. Part D is the
concluding chapter of this dissertation. In concluding, this dissertation examines the
impact of ethnic divisions on social and political policies in Malaysia and considers the
extent of government intervention in the economy based on race which has ultimately
impacted on the protection and implementation of minority rights in Malaysia. It is the
writer's opinion that the source of ethnic conflict lies within the introduction of legal
doctrines which are purposellly detrimental to the rights of minorities. Accordingly,
the concluding chapter recommends reforms to Malaysia's legal system and policies to
rninirnise the risk of an eruption of inter-ethnic tensions.

The aim of this dissertation is to demonstrate that Malaysia's politicisation of competing
ethnic interests has resulted in the maintenance of preferential policies detrimental to
minority rights and contrary to international law.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ethnic relations</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="subject">Legal status</field><field name="subject">laws</field><field name="subject">Human rights</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070509.132340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is pay TV meeting its promise?</field><field name="creator">marmcc@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">The broadcasting sector is a subject of continual debate in modern society. One of the
oldest segments of the rapidly-evolving information technology and communications
industry, it is still the most content rich and the most popular. Australians who watch
television spend more time doing so than doing any other leisure activity &#150; except those
who fish (ABS 1998). Broadcasting is highly pervasive. Some kind of service is
available and used in every Australian household. Everyone is an expert, everyone has
an opinion. Since the Federal Government decided to allow the introduction of
domestic subscription television in 1992, pay television has been broadly dismissed by
its media rivals as being unpopular, unprofitable and unnecessary. In turn, the
Australian pay television industry considers that it is over-regulated, especially
compared to the free-to-air sector, and that much of this regulation severely constrains
its ability to grow its subscriber base. This thesis examines whether the Australian
subscription television industry has achieved the aims set for it by the legislators in
1992 &#150; that is, whether it has &#145;met its promise&#146;. To achieve this, the thesis first
identifies the &#145;promises&#146; of an Australian subscription television industry. In assessing
whether the industry has met its promise, the thesis considers various aspects of the
industry, including what the industry has needed to do to make itself profitable and
ensure its longevity and the environment within which the industry operates. The thesis
examines the role that content plays in attracting subscribers and considers whether
minimal content regulation has resulted in a paucity of local content on subscription
television in Australia. The thesis draws on existing academic literature, government
publications, information released by the subscription television industry itself and
interviews conducted in the course of the project with the Australian subscription
television sector. It also uses and builds on ratings data to examine the programs and
channels that are offered by Australian pay television services. In concluding, this
thesis makes an assessment of whether the Australian pay television industry has met its
promise.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pay TV</field><field name="subject">subscription television</field><field name="subject">subscription TV</field><field name="subject">Australian content</field><field name="subject">local content</field><field name="subject">media policy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070514.112807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The need for realignment of primary science assessment to contemporary needs : assessment of learning and assessment for learning</field><field name="creator">irislee12001@yahoo.com.sg</field><field name="description">The ultimate purpose of this study was to investigate how to best prepare Singapore
students for the Knowledge-based Economy (KBE). Investigating the possible need for
the realignment of the primary science assessment to the KBE was of utmost interest as
assessment was viewed as the driver of the actual curriculum.

This was a mixed methods design study (Creswell, 2005). Fifteen teachers were first
interviewed to ascertain the major features of primary school science assessment in both
Perth, Western Australia and Singapore. A list of twelve questions was prepared for the
eight teacher interviewees in Singapore and the seven teacher interviewees in Perth. The
NUD*IST program was used to help organise trends in these teacher responses.
Definitions of KBE skills were synthesised from literature reviews and validated by the
fifteen teachers for the subsequent survey. The survey involved a list of demographic
questions and two matrices. The first matrix required the teachers to rate, on a
four-point scale, the use of the eleven assessment modes for the twelve 'process' and
KBE skills. The second matrix was a frequency check to determine if the teachers had
used a particular mode to assess a particular skill. One hundred and forty-five usable
surveys were analysed. The Rasch analysis was performed through RUMM2020
program and unfolding model was sought through the program RateFOLD.

The interviews first established that KBE skills and a variety of assessment modes were
needed for today's classes. The survey confirmed these needs and found that the paper
and pencil test was the most frequently used assessment procedures in Singapore and Perth. In both interviews and the survey, teachers were requested to match the skill(s) to
the appropriate assessment mode(s) though the details and justification of such tasks
were explained by the teachers in the interviews. In the process, other factors such as
'time constraints' and 'ranking of the teachers' were uncovered as 'hindrances' to
teachers assessing the students appropriately for learning. The problems identified by
the Singapore teachers were a lack of time, overloaded syllabi and the crucial perceived
need of assessment of learning (high-stake summative tests).

The results of both the interviews and survey supported the need for a variety of
assessment modes (Gray &amp; Sharp, 2001; Hackling, 2004; National Research Council,
1996, 2001 &amp; 2003; Sebatane, 1998; Sterenberg, 1998) to help students learn science in
today's contemporary classes. The Singapore teachers in this study were also appealing
for help from the policy-makers to use a variety of assessment modes as the system that
stipulated the use of the paper and pencil testing was beyond their control and
jurisdiction.

Recommendations that stemmed from this study include allowing teachers to use a
variety of assessments to assess the students' learning in the high-stake Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE) and not just the paper and pencil mode that has been in
used for at least the last thirty years. There are important implications as the learning
theories that are currently used to support the assessment of learning are no longer
sufficient nor in total alignment with the needs for today's class. For example, a
behaviourist taxonomy of skills emphasises the measurable output and not the process of learning. Socio-constructivist approaches that focus on the individual constructing
meaning in hislher context such as the use of ongoing formative assessment to
encourage feedback (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998a &amp; b) may assist in engaging the students
in lifelong learning which is required in the KBE.

Lastly, the significance of this study lies in two aspects, the practical and the scholarly.
This study provides the evidence for the need primary science assessment to be more
aligned to contemporary needs. This in turn will assist in better preparing the young of
Singapore, who are the nation's only natural resource, for the workforce. This study also
aims to contribute to the body of knowledge in three ways. Firstly, KBE needs will be
connected to the primary science classroom via assessment of skills. Secondly, both
KBE and process skills were found to be more appropriately assessed by assessment
modes such as portfolio and paper and pencil respectively, as demonstrated through the
analysis by Rasch and unfolding models. Thirdly, the gap between the implemented and
official curriculum will be narrowed with this proposed change in assessment processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge-based Economy skills</field><field name="subject">process skills</field><field name="subject">variety of assessment modes</field><field name="subject">assessment of learning</field><field name="subject">assessment for learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070514.114117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro soil-less (IVS) rooting medium</field><field name="creator">chrisn@npmicro.com.au</field><field name="description">The principle hypothesis of this thesis is that hypoxia, in agar-based media, compromises rooting in vitro. From a practical point of view this is important because most plant tissue culture activities require the material to be successfully acclimatised in a nursery environment. Compromised rooting often results in excessive losses at this stage which are costly and inconvenient. In addition, many plants with commercial and/or scientific interest remain unavailable as they are not able to be rooted and acclimatised reliably. The use of agar as a rooting medium has limited the capacity of plant tissue culture to clonally propagate many plants.

The thesis begins by demonstrating how poorly some plants respond to agar rooting media. Juvenile Chamelaucium hybrid microcuttings were pulsed with IBA 40 &#236;M and then placed for 3 weeks on either M1 (&#189; MS) or aerated in vitro soil-less substrate (IVS) (Chapter 2). IVS had 42&#150;82% rooting at the end of Stage 3 compared with 0&#150;1% in agar. Shoot survival for IVS-rooted microcuttings was significantly greater than M1-rooted shoots. Pulsed shoots placed in IVS showed root primordia after 7 days. In contrast, shoots placed in agar showed no root primordia after 21 days and formed callus but did not root when subsequently placed in IVS for a further 4 weeks. The agar medium almost totally and permanently inhibited the capacity of competent shoots to form root primordia and roots.

The effectiveness of different types of aerated and non-aerated media, including IVS, were tested to validate the hypothesis (Chapter 3). Microcuttings from shoot cultures of two Australian plants Grevillea thelemanniana and Verticordia plumosa x Chamelaucium uncinatum were pulsed for 7 days on a high auxin (40 &#236;M IBA), agar-solidified medium in the dark. Rooting of the microcuttings was then compared on five experimental substrates: a) standard agar M1 medium (&#189; MS, no hormones, 8 g agar L-1), b) porous-agar medium (&#189; MS, no hormones, 30 g agar L-1, solidified then blended to provide aeration), c) white sand wet with liquid M1, d) white sand with M1 medium containing agar, and e) IVS. A separate experiment involved flushing the IVS soil profile with low or normal oxygen. Low and variable rooting percentages were recorded on the controls on M1 medium. Root induction and average total root length per microcutting at final harvest were significantly higher using the porous media including IVS, blended agar or white sand. The M1 medium and the addition of M1 medium to sand suppressed the percentage rooting and elongation. Flushing the IVS rooting medium with low oxygen also suppressed rooting. The experiments showed that increasing the air-filled porosity of the rooting medium has a positive effect on rooting and this is most likely due to the increased oxygen at the base of the microcutting. The role of ethylene, and the sugar and nutrients in M1 were not investigated.

The efficacy of the IVS protocol on a range of Australian herbaceous and woody species was investigated to determine whether the observed benefits were generic or plant specific (Chapter 4). Improved rooting in IVS compared to agar was shown for 28 Australian species and genotypes from the families Liliaceae, Haemodoraceae, Myrtaceae, Thymelaeaceae, Proteaceae, Goodeniaceae and Rutaceae. Twenty-seven of the 28 species rooted in IVS medium at equal or better rates than in M1. In three cases &#151; Actinodium cunninghamii, one of the Pimelea physodes genotypes and one of the Eriostemon australasius genotypes &#151; shoots did not root in M1 but showed good root development in IVS medium. With few exceptions average root length and number in microcuttings rooted in IVS was superior to those in agar medium.

To further test the resilience of the hypothesis, it was tested on nodal microcuttings of lentil which are recalcitrant to root in vitro (Chapter 5). The veracity of a published conclusion that inverted lentil microcuttings (with their base in the air) root better because of their altered polarity was also examined. It was found that, as is the case for many species, roots initiated and grew only at the proximal end of the microcutting regardless of its orientation. When the proximal end was in agar (a hypoxic environment) the rooting percentage was low (9&#150;25%) even when the orientation of the microcutting was altered by inverting the culture tube. In contrast, when the proximal end of the microcutting was in an aerobic environment (from the shoot being placed upside down in agar medium or placed normally or upside down in an aerated medium) rooting percentages were higher (62&#150;100%).

Given that Stage 2 microcuttings are prepared with the objective to root and acclimatise them to nursery conditions, the duration of this activity becomes important as it can impact on plant quality and costs. The pulsing protocol and the length of time that Stage 3 cultures remain in the culture room during the rooting phase is a component of the unit cost of production of each rooted microcutting. Initially a 7-day IBA pulse was used after which the pulsed microcuttings were transferred to IVS to root. Chapter 6 shows that the pulsing period can be shortened to one day or replaced with a single auxin dip while still achieving high rooting percentages and maintaining plant quality. These materials handling improvements go some way to realising the logistical benefits of ex vitro rooting but without compromising the positive influences of hygiene and a stable environment of the in vitro environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IVS</field><field name="subject">vitro environment</field><field name="subject">plants</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070514.132029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Apobec3g and Deoxythymidylate Kinase Genetic Diversity on Hiv-1 Hypermutation and Response to Treatment</field><field name="creator">craig.pace@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses two important topics in HIV-1 medicine; (i) the clinical
relevance of pre-treatment G-A hypermutation and the contribution of host and
viral genetics to its development and; (ii) the influence of genetic variation in host
enzymes responsible for antiretroviral drug metabolism on response to therapy.
These themes are outlined below.

HIV-1 Hypermutation
At present, limited data exists regarding the relative roles of host encoded cytidine
deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F in promoting G-A hypermutation of
HIV-1 proviral DNA in vivo, nor the clinical relevance of hypermutation or the
influence of genetic diversity of the APOBEC3G locus and of the viral encoded vif
protein that counteracts the action of APOBEC3G. The analyses contained within
this thesis demonstrate that within the WA HIV cohort, clinically relevant
hypermutation is restricted to a minority of individuals and is mediated
predominantly by APOBEC3G. In this study, the presence of HIV-1 hypermutation
had a substantially greater effect on plasma viremia than other known host antiviral
factors such as CCR5D32 or specific HLA-B alleles. Furthermore, the considerable
genetic diversity of the vif gene is likely to make a greater contribution to the
development of hypermutation than the limited genetic diversity of the APOBEC3G
gene in Caucasians. These data indicate that G-A hypermutation is a clinically
relevant phenomenon and may provide a fresh perspective to the area of HIV/AIDS
therapies.

Genetic Determinant of HIV-1 Treatment Response
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and thymidylate kinase (dTMPK) are rate limiting
enzymes for the metabolism of the antiretrovirals d4T and AZT, respectively, and
are thus central to the antiviral efficacy and toxicity of these agents. However, the
genetic diversity of TK2 and dTMPK and their influence on toxicities associated
with their use is largely unknown. The results discussed in this thesis indicate that in
contrast to the highly conserved TK2 locus, the dTMPK locus of Caucasian
individuals, including regulatory regions potentially influencing transcription and
translation, is considerably polymorphic and organised into five common haplotypes.
The results regarding the contribution of dTMPK genetic variation to toxicities
associated with AZT therapy are encouraging. A common dTMPK haplotype had
significant, albeit modest, effect on haematological parameters (haemoglobin and
mean corpuscular volume) in HIV-infected patients, although no AZT-specific
treatment effect was observed in this relatively haematologically stable cohort. In
addition, another common dTMPK haplotype provided significant protection against
AZT-induced adipocyte mtDNA depletion in a pilot study of AZT- and d4T-treated
individuals. The dTMPK haplotypes characterised in this thesis should facilitate
further studies regarding dTMPK genetic variation in HIV-1 infection and response
to treatment, which are warranted from the clinical results presented herein.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic Determinant</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">APOBEC3G</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070515.114340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the fluency paradigm : the effects of accuracy training before rate-building and incremental increases in response rates on skill retention, endurance, stability, application and adduction</field><field name="creator">Catherine Coyle</field><field name="description">Fluency has recently been operationalized in terms of the acquisition of performance
rates that predict a number of learning outcomes, depicted in the acronym RESAA,
which represents skill retention, endurance, stability, application and adduction
(Johnson &amp; Layng, 1996). The RESAA model has not yet been adequately researched
under controlled, experimental conditions.

A preliminary study (Study 1) compared two rate-building procedures, under
experimental conditions, with five Year 2 children with a mean age of six years eight
months and seven pre-primary children with a mean age of four years seven months.
The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled. Long-term follow-up
RESAA measures were conducted three months after the completion of the
intervention.

The major study in this research project (Study 2) is an empirical investigation
of the effects on RESAA measures of increasing the performance rates of a component
skill in reading to specific, incremental rate aims with twelve Year 2 children aged
between six years eight months and eight years one month who were categorized into
three levels of reading ability. Speeded practice was compared to slow-paced
constrained-rate practice. The effects of practice and reinforcement were controlled.
The utility of learning channel analysis for defining measures of application and
adduction, and for measuring adduction on two composite tasks involving
topographically dissimilar sensory and response dimensions was examined. Long-term
follow-up RESAA measures were conducted three months after the completion of the
intervention.

The results of Study 1 indicated a procedure in which accuracy and rate were
trained simultaneously was more efficient in increasing component skill rates and
produced higher rates on the RESAA measures than training accuracy to 100% in a
stage before rate-building commenced for the Year 2 children and two pre-primary
children. Training accuracy to 100% before rate-building was marginally more efficient
for five of the pre-primary children. Adduction was greater for a one learning-channel
cross than for a two learning-channel cross.

The results of Study 2 demonstrated that systematic increases in component skill
rates were produced by both the rate-building and constrained-rate procedures, although
higher rates were produced by the rate-building procedures for eleven of the twelve
children. Higher training rates of the component skills produced concurrently higher
rates on repeated RESAA measures during the intervention and on RESAA follow-up
measures. Adduction was greater for a two learning-channel cross than for a one
learning-channel cross. The level of reading ability of the children did not influence
training rates of the component skill but did affect performances on the RESAA
measures. Comparisons indicated that different training rates predicted different
RESAA outcomes for all of the children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Fluency</field><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070515.142051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carcass and eating quality of sheep grazing saltbush based saline pasture systems</field><field name="creator">k.pearce@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Forage halophytes such as saltbush (Atriplex spp) are being widely used to revegetate Australian
saline land and can also provide a medium quality fodder source. There is widespread anecdotal
evidence that sheep grazing on saltbush are leaner, tastier and juicer. This thesis investigated the
potential to produce a high quality carcass with improved eating quality from grazing sheep on
saltbush on saline land.

The first experimental chapter in this thesis details an animal house experiment investigating the
carcass, eating and wool quality and physiological responses of sheep ingesting a 60:40 dried
saltbush (Atriplex nummularia):barley grain (S+B), ration verses a 33:25:42 lupin grain:barley
grain:oaten hay ration (Control, C) for 10 weeks prior to commercial slaughter (Chapter 4).
Subsequently, two field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of grazing saltbush
on saline land compared to dry senesced pasture on carcass and eating quality of lambs
(Goomalling 2003) and hoggets (Wickepin 2004) (both chapter 6) for 14 weeks. Both chapters
demonstrated that the ingestion of saltbush resulted in significantly less fat and in the 2 field
experiments the ingestion of saltbush resulted in more lean on the carcass compared to sheep
grazing a stubble/pasture (control) ration. These are positive findings for processors as costs of
fat denudation are high so the lower the fat content and for farmers because less fat is deposited
on the carcass per unit of liveweight gain. The decreased deposition of fat was attributed to the
higher protein:energy ratio available for production, secondary compounds in saltbush and lower
circulating insulin and higher growth hormone of the S+B fed sheep compared to the control fed
sheep. Further work is needed to determine if these beneficial improvements in carcass
composition can be achieved without compromising animal production. The long term grazing of
saltbush did not result in commercially desirable hot carcass weights unless the sheep were supplemented with a high energy source such as barley. The low growth rates are attributed to a
decreased availability of energy substrates, low feed intake and increased energy output of sheep
fed high salt diets. The low energy intake of the S+B fed sheep also resulted in an a significantly
lower percentage of unsaturated fat and unchanged levels of saturated fat in the fat depots
compared to the C treatment.

Consumer taste tests conducted on meat from experiments in both chapter 4 and 6 indicated no
difference between the treatments for any of the eating quality traits assessed. This can be
considered a positive result as sheep can be finished on saltbush without any detriment to eating
quality. High vitamin E levels in the meat may have also prevented the development of rancid
flavours and aroma. It can be speculated that saltbush does not impart beneficial flavour and
aroma volatiles as previously thought; instead the high vitamin E levels inhibit off-flavour and
aroma development compared to meat from sheep grazed on dry pasture.

The long term ingestion of saltbush also resulted in significantly lower urine specific gravity
(USG), muscle dry matter and higher urine weights suggesting that the saltbush fed sheep had a
better hydration status compared to control fed sheep. However, this finding did not correspond
with higher hot carcass weight or dressing percentages. The increases in muscle fluid content of
the saltbush fed sheep were attributed to changes in body composition. The saltbush fed sheep
had a higher lean and lower fat content which corresponded with a greater body fluid content as
found in the animal house study.

Under conditions where the body composition of sheep remains the same, the use of short term
strategic feeding of components of saltbush was investigated (mimicked in the form of salt and
betaine) to reduce dehydration and subsequent reductions in carcass weight and dressing percentages (Chapter 7). Salt and or betaine were fed for 1 week either prior to a 48 h period of
water deprivation or prior to 48 h commercial slaughter process where water was available in
lairage from 24-48 h. Under both scenarios the diets did not result in improved dressing
percentages, hot carcass weights, muscle dry matter or muscle weights. The ingestion of high salt
diet prior to slaughter, did increase fluid retention in the extracellular spaces prior to slaughter
however by 48 h both groups were at a similar physiological and therefore similar hydration
status. Therefore similar levels of fluid were present in the muscles and no difference in carcass
weight or dressing percentage could be expected. An important observation from the second
experiment was that the high salt group drunk more water than the low salt fed sheep but the low
salt group consumed fluid in lairage also. The low salt fed sheep may have been encouraged to
drink water after observing the frequent drinking patterns of the high salt group.

This thesis has also shown that saltbush contains high levels of vitamin E (&#225;-tocopherol) (193
mg/kg dry matter). As a result the concentration of &#225;-tocopherol in plasma, liver and muscle of
the saltbush fed sheep was elevated compared to those grazing dry pasture. The high muscle
concentrations of vitamin E in the saltbush-grazed sheep resulted in improved meat colour
stability. The high vitamin E levels did not influence the drip and cooking loss of the meat
despite a decrease in the muscle dry matter of the meat. The browning of meat and increased drip
loss results in large losses to the meat industry due to value deterioration at the supermarket.
There is also great potential for the high vitamin E content in saltbush to be used for the
prevention of nutritional myopathy instead of using expensive and labour intensive synthetic
supplements.

In conclusion, this thesis has provided an insight into the carcass and eating quality of sheep
grazed on saltbush based saline pasture systems.

were found dead or dying off the coast of Australia and also in New Zealand. The
epizootics moved progressively, at a rapid speed against the prevailing currents. A
previously unrecognised herpesvirus, Pilchard herpesvirus (PHV), was identified as
the causative agent.

Until recently, rapid and sensitive methods to detect PHV were not available and
based on a previously identified and conserved 373 bp region of the genome,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridisation and real-time PCR methods
were developed for the specific detection of PHV in formaldehyde-fixed and frozen
tissues of pilchards. Real-time PCR was shown to have greater sensitivity than a
conventional PCR and in situ hybridisation for the detection of PHV infection.
The PCR assay and sequence analysis of the amplification products was used to
compare the 373 bp region of the genome from strains obtained during the 1995
and 1998 epidemics. Significant differences between the strains were not detected.
Additional sequence data was obtained adjacent to the 373 bp of known PHV
sequence, which did not match any sequence in any of the genetic databases, and
this will be invaluable for further study of the pilchard herpesvirus and the
development of improved detection methods.

The molecular-based methods of virus detection developed were applied to a reexamination
of virus in paraffin-embedded tissues taken from fish during an attempt
to transmit the virus to wild caught pilchards in 1999. The results obtained
confirmed previously equivocal results that transmission of PHV to wild caught
pilchards was achieved, although this experiment failed to demonstrate that
transmission of the virus resulted in severe lesions typical of those seen in the
epizootics.

Using formaldehyde-fixed samples from fish collected during the 1998 PHV
epizootic, virus was detected in fish collected 4 days prior to the occurrence of the
epizootic even though the fish then appeared clinically normal, during the epizootic,
and 8 days after mortalities had ceased.

An investigation of wild pilchards collected from 4 Australian pilchard subpopulations
using real-time PCR demonstrated that PHV was present in the gills of
13.75% of 800 fish sampled, indicating that the virus is now endemic in the
Australian pilchard population. Variation in the prevalence of PHV infection in the 4
subpopulations was detected, higher in western and southern populations than in
populations from the east coast. The endemic nature of PHV infection in the
pilchard population explains why there have been no further epizootics with mass
mortalities since 1998.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pilchard herpesvirus</field><field name="subject">molecular</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070528.142452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wildlife tourism and the natural sciences: bringing them together</field><field name="creator">K.Rodger@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Wildlife tourism, the viewing of wildlife in their natural environment, is a growing
sector of tourism world wide. The presence of diverse and unusual wildlife is a major
influence on visitors choosing Australia as a destination. Little is currently known
about the short and long term impacts on the wildlife on which such tourism depends.
This has resulted in management agencies making decisions on the suitability of
human-wildlife interactions based on insufficient data. Given the diversity of possible
impacts and responses, plus concerns surrounding sustainability, it is essential that
good empirical scientific research is available to inform management. Therefore, the
aim of this study was to understand and hence improve the use of science and
monitoring in the management of wildlife tourism.

This study, using surveys, interviews and case study analysis, drew on tour operators,
managers and scientists&#146; perspectives and understandings of the role of science in the
management of wildlife tourism. From tour operators&#146; perspectives, accessed through a
mail-based survey, insight into features of the wildlife tourism industry in Australia
today was provided. It was identified as an industry characterised by diversity in
destinations, activities and expectations. Furthermore, the levels of engagement by
scientists with tour operators are low, raising concerns about the industry&#146;s
sustainability, if science is regarded as an essential component of sustainability.

From managers&#146; and scientists&#146; perspective, accessed through personal interviews,
several barriers were identified as hindering scientists from engaging in wildlife
tourism science. These included scientists&#146; perceptions of power, their normative
beliefs of science, and difficulties with transdisciplinary work. Today&#146;s culture tends to
show a shift away from scientific research. In the past researchers were able to receive
funding by appealing to society&#146;s faith in science. However, this is not the case today.
Through being disengaged and objective scientists have experienced decreased power
over funding allocations and in turn decreased funding. Another barrier was the
dominant normative view of many biologists and ecologists that wildlife tourism
science was not &#145;real science&#146; because it is subjective. The final barrier was difficulties
with the actual research due to the transdisciplinary approach needed.

The case study analysis, of science and wildlife tourism science in the Antarctic
region, illustrated how these barriers can be overcome under certain circumstances.
Using actor-network theory and the broader sociology of science, this part of the study
described the power relationships and potential transformations between scientists,
wildlife and managers, which allowed the development of research into humanwildlife
interactions. By highlighting the use of principles from the natural sciences,
wildlife tourism scientists were able to enrol actors into their network. However, this
actor network was not permanently &#145;black boxed&#146; due to scientists&#146; adverse
perceptions of the significance and necessity of wildlife tourism science together with
their normative beliefs on science, with the network ultimately disbanding.

Key findings from this study included the importance in recognising the
epistemological and ontological position that scientists occupy. A broadening of
training of natural scientists is required so that they can reflect on their paradigmatic
position. Wildlife tourism scientists need to acknowledge and understand different
scientific paradigms exist and be able to work across them. Furthermore, wildlife
tourism scientists need to emphasise their affinity with the normative beliefs of the
biological sciences in their research activities. As the scientific community is subject
to values and bias just the same as any other human enterprise, wildlife tourism
science would be more readily achieved and accepted by the use of methodologies
developed by wildlife biologists to give scientific validity to wildlife tourism science.
Only with the employment of the biological principles tied in with the social sciences
(i.e. transdisciplinary) will the scientific community have higher regard for wildlife
tourism science. Finally, there is a need for scientists to become more politically and
socially engaged. Given the importance of science for managing wildlife tourism,
mechanisms for increasing the use of science in human-wildlife interaction research
are critical for the long-term sustainability of this industry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology of science</field><field name="subject">wildlife</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070605.113857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FLJ22318: A Novel Binding Partner of the NKX3-1 Homeodomain Protein in Prostate Cancer Cells</field><field name="creator">L.Dawson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer is a frequently diagnosed malignancy which ranges from an indolent asymptomatic tumour to an aggressive, rapidly lethal systemic disease. Determination of chromosomal, genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with prostate carcinogenesis have led to the characterisation of functional consequences of these alterations, thereby elucidating pathways contributing to malignant growth that can be utilised clinically and therapeutically. 

FLJ22318 is a novel hypothetical protein that was identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis to interact with the prostatic homeodomain protein, NKX3-1. Expression of NKX3-1 is largely restricted to epithelial cells of the adult prostate where it is involved in maintaining the prostatic phenotype, while NKX3-1 expression is reduced or absent in prostate tumours.  In contrast, FLJ22318 expression is documented in cDNA libraries derived from a variety of human adult and foetal tissues including the prostate, suggesting that it may be ubiquitously expressed and that it potentially interacts with a number of proteins in addition to NKX3-1. FLJ22318 expression is undocumented in human prostate tumours.

Bioinformatic analyses have postulated multiple FLJ22318 mRNA transcripts however the proposed open reading frames encoded by these transcripts predict the FLJ22318 protein to contain three strong protein-protein interaction domains, a Lissencephaly type-1-like homology (LisH), a C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) and a CT11-RanBPM (CRA) domain. Of the 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within the FLJ22318 gene, none are located within the protein coding region suggesting that FLJ22318 may be critical for cell survival and/or function. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between human FLJ22318 and its orthologues in a diverse range of mammalian species identified &gt;97% sequence homology, providing further strong evidence of the critical cellular function of FLJ22318.

To characterise the biological activity of FLJ22318 in prostate cancer cells, the FLJ22318 coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligated into mammalian and bacterial expression vectors to encode V5-, myc-, GFP-, HA-, and GST-FLJ22318 fusion proteins. Interaction between FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 was confirmed using (reverse) yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. These data were supported by confocal microscopy which demonstrated the perinuclear and nuclear co-localisation of FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 in prostate cancer cells. Northern blotting identified expression of ~2Kb and ~4Kb FLJ22318 mRNA&#146;s in prostate cancer cell lines, which was consistent with bioinformatic analyses of mRNA species. Transfection of prostate cancer cells to overexpress FLJ22318 did not alter endogenous NKX3-1 levels, however FLJ22318 exhibited transcriptional repressor function on an NKX3-1 responsive element and increased NKX3-1 transcriptional repressor activity on this element.

To further investigate FLJ22318 function, additional yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed in prostate cancer cells to identify potential FLJ22318 binding proteins. These studies isolated cDNA&#146;s encoding 33 different proteins involved in cell metabolism and apoptosis as well as transcriptional regulators associated with control of cellular proliferation. One of the candidate FLJ22318 interactors, protein kinase, interferon-inducible double stranded RNA dependent activator (PRKRA/PACT) was shown using confocal microscopy to extensively co-localise with FLJ22318 in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions of prostate cancer cells. Preliminary co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays have provided additional evidence of the interaction of PRKRA and FLJ22318.

Results of this thesis have generated important information characterising the structure of the FLJ22318 gene and protein, the interaction between FLJ22318 and NKX3-1 and the potential functions of FLJ22318 in prostate cancer cells. As the FLJ22318 gene is located on 5q35, a chromosomal region frequently disrupted in a variety of tumours, future studies of the biological activity of FLJ22318 will clarify its normal cellular functions and its contribution to tumorigenesis or malignant progression in the prostate and in other tissues.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">FLJ22318</field><field name="subject">Homeodomain protein NKX3-1</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070622.92421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Spiritual But Not Religious"
A Phenomenological Study of Spirituality in the Everyday Lives of Younger Women in Contemporary Australia.</field><field name="creator">k.hudson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In current discussions about contemporary forms of spirituality, consideration is given to the question, &#145;what is spirituality?&#146; and to exploring the range of associated beliefs and practices. Common to most discussions is the acknowledgement that the term spirituality is ambiguous and does not represent any one finite quality or thing, but rather, is a wide and somewhat identifiable set of characteristics. Some commentators suggest that contemporary spirituality, characterised by its separation from institutional forms of religion, and represented by the hallmark expression &#147;I am spiritual, but not religious&#148;, is an increasing phenomenon in Australian society. In view of this, there are several debates about the merits of a spirituality without explicit links to religion (in particular Christian traditions) and whether a personal spirituality can hold any real depth or purpose, or whether it just perpetuates a superficial, narcissistic focus of the self. This kind of critique pays little attention as to how spirituality, and the associated beliefs and practices, are developed and applied in an everyday sense, and how this impacts on the lives of those who subscribe to their own sense of spirituality. 

In this thesis, I shift the focus from analysing the merits of a personalised spirituality to exploring in depth some of the lay understandings and purposes underlying contemporary forms of spiritual practice. The primary concern of my thesis is to describe this phenomena of spiritual life as experienced by eleven younger Australian women aged 18-38 years inclusive, who considered themselves &#145;spiritual&#146; women, yet do not necessarily identify with a particular religious denomination. At its core, and as a phenomenological study, the thesis undertakes a theoretical exploration of consciousness and the apprehension and formation of belief, meaning, and identity. Held central, and alongside the phenomenological methodology, is the feminist notion that every woman is the centre of her own experience, that any interpretations and understandings of women&#146;s spirituality, must start with the personal. The empirical stages of research therefore focus on an exploration of the women&#146;s personal understandings, experiences, interpretations and translations of spirituality to uncover the location and application of spirituality in everyday life. 

A primary factor explored throughout the thesis is the intersection between emotional experiences, meaning and purpose, and notions of spirituality. It is my assertion that grief, crisis and trauma, and the more general emotional experiences arising from everyday life, can be a driving force to embark on an exploration of the spiritual; inform personal constructions of spirituality; and provide a basis for the articulation of that spirituality, with a central purpose of alleviating emotional pain. Thus, my main thesis contention is this &#145;new&#146; form of spirituality, as experienced and practiced outside of religious institutions, was expressed by the women in this research as a conscious and pragmatic resource applied, and developed in relation to, the various events and experiences of everyday life, and in relation to the ongoing process of developing and locating a sense of self and identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">belief</field><field name="subject">meaning</field><field name="subject">everyday life</field><field name="subject">grief</field><field name="subject">crisis</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070711.105502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of the world bank's socio-institutional neoliberalism</field><field name="creator">T.Carroll@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the so called post-Washington consensus (PWC) and the role of the
World Bank in its promotion and implementation. It argues that the PWC represents the
promotion of a new form of neoliberalism &#150; socio-institutional neoliberalism (SIN) &#150;
which stems from the conflict and contradiction associated with the Washington
consensus based around earlier neoliberal prescriptions such as fiscal discipline, trade
liberalisation and privatisation. While seeking the continued extension of liberal
markets attempted by proponents of the Washington consensus, SIN rigorously
specifies the institutional elements that neoliberals now see markets requiring. It
stipulates a particular state form and even allocates roles to specific social institutions.
Vitally, SIN is not just about policy content. Indeed, it is an attempt to shape the very
environment through which policy can be contested. To this end, SIN includes
important delivery devices and political technologies to aid with embedding reform, in
an attempt to resolve one of the major problems for the Washington consensus:
insufficient progress in reform implementation.

SIN is highly political in terms of its ideological commitments, the policy
matrices that these commitments generate and the processes by which the
implementation of reform is attempted. As a political programme, SIN seeks nothing
less than the embedding of a form of governance that attempts to contain the inevitable
clashes associated with the extension of market relations. While this attempt at
extending market relations inextricably links the Washington consensus with the PWC,
it is the substantive efforts and new methods associated with the latter to deliver and
deeply embed policy which make it distinct.

Yet SIN continues to face differing degrees of acceptance and resistance in the
underdeveloped world. Here it is essential to consider internal Bank dynamics, relations
between the Bank and member countries, and the various alliances and conflicts within
these countries and their involvement in either promoting or resisting SIN reform. A
feature of this thesis is the analytical framework that allows systematic consideration of
these diverse political dynamics. Crucially, the reality of such political dynamics means
that there is often a significant gap between what the World Bank promotes and what
occurs on the ground.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Bank</field><field name="subject">Post-Washington Consenses</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.113619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple arithmetic processing : fact retrieval mechanisms and the influence of individual difference, surface from, problem type and split on processing</field><field name="creator">n.jackson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Current theorising in the area of cognitive arithmetic suggests that simple arithmetic knowledge is stored in memory and accessed in the same way as word knowledge i.e., it is stored in a network of associations, with simple facts retrieved automatically from memory. However, to date, the main methodologies that have been employed to investigate automaticity in simple arithmetic processing (e.g., production and verification) have produced a wide variety of difficulties in interpretation. In an attempt to address this, the present series of investigations utilised a numerical variant of the well established single word semantic priming paradigm that involved the presentation of problems as primes (e.g., 2 + 3) and solutions as targets (e.g., 5), as they would occur in a natural setting. Adult university students were exposed to both addition and multiplication problems in each of three main prime target relationship conditions, including congruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 5), incongruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 13), and neutral conditions (X + Y and 5). When combined with a naming task and the use of short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), this procedure enabled a more valid and reliable investigation into automaticity and the cognitive mechanisms underlying simple arithmetic processing. 

The first investigation in the present series addressed the question of automaticity in arithmetic fact retrieval, whilst the remaining investigations examined the main factors thought to influence simple arithmetic processing i.e., skill level, surface form, problem type and split. All factors, except for problem type, were found to influence processing in the arithmetic priming paradigm. For example, the results of all five investigations were consistent in revealing significant facilitation in naming congruent targets for skilled participants, following exposure to Arabic digit primes at the short SOA. Accordingly, the facilitation was explained in terms of the operation of an automatic spreading activation mechanism. Additionally, significant inhibitory effects in incongruent target naming were identified in skilled performance in all of the studies in the present series of investigations. Throughout the course of these investigations, these effects were found to vary with operation, surface form and SOA, and in the final investigation, the level of inhibition was found to vary with the split between the correct solution and the incongruent target. Consequently, a number of explanations were put forward to account for these effects. In the first two investigations, it was suggested that the inhibitory effects resulted from the use of a response validity checking mechanism, whilst in the final investigation, the results were more consistent with the activation of magnitude representations in memory (this can be likened to Dehaene&#146;s, 1997, &#145;number sense&#146;). In contrast, the results of the third investigation led to the proposal that for number word primes, inhibition in processing results from the activation of phonological representations in memory, via a reading based mechanism.     

The present series of investigations demonstrated the utility of the numerical variant of the single word semantic priming paradigm for the investigation of simple arithmetic processing. Given its capacity to uncover the fundamental cognitive mechanisms at work in simple arithmetic operations, this methodology has many applications in future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arithmetic</field><field name="subject">Fact Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Individual Differences</field><field name="subject">Surface Form</field><field name="subject">Problem Type</field><field name="subject">Split Effects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.114439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating porcine and feline zona pellucida as immunocontraceptive antigens in the female domestic cat</field><field name="creator">joyceand@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Immunocontraception, or contraception mediated by the immune system, is being
widely studied as an alternative, humane form of population control. The induction of
an immune response against a specific component of the mammalian oocyte, termed
zona pellucida (ZP) has been shown to be an effective immunocontraceptive in several
species. Comparatively little work has been done investigating the use of ZP antigens
in the domestic cat. This study aimed to investigate porcine ZP(B+C) and feline ZPA,
B and C as immunogens in the domestic cat, and further to elucidate their effects on
reproduction. Immunisation of female cats with porcine ZP(B+C) failed to elicit a
detectable antibody response as assessed by ELISA, immunoblotting and
immunohistochemistry. Additionally, there was no effect on the structure of the ovaries
nor on breeding performance. Feline ZPA, B and C were cloned into the
pkCMVint.polyli mammalian expression vector and used to immunise female cats.
ELISA revealed that immunisation with either pkCMVint.fZP(B+C) or pkCMVint.fZPA
DNA (Treated) resulted in a low-level circulating antibody response, which was
apparently short-lived. Immunoblotting did not reveal any common pattern of
recognition of antigenic polypeptides between responding animals. Ovaries from fZP
Treated animals, however, showed antibody binding specifically on the ZP of follicles
from late primary / early secondary, through to antral stages. Despite the antibody
binding, the overall structure of the ovaries remained unaffected in all but two of the
fZP Treated cats. Two fZPA immunised cats exhibited ovaries that had no
recognisable follicular structures, however, the observed abnormalities could not be
conclusively linked to fZPA immunisation. Overall, a significant lymphoproliferative
response was shown in fZP Treated cats when compared with Controls. Fertility was
not significantly affected in fZP Treated cats, although there was a tendency towards
increased incidence of unsuccessful matings or pregnancies. The fZP DNA
preparations studied here exhibit potential as an immunocontraceptive, with the ability
to generate a lymphoproliferative response against fZP and elicit antibodies
specifically recognizing fZP in situ. Further studies should continue to investigate the
immunogenicity of, and characterise the immune response against, such fZP DNA

impacts for decades. Once their presence is confirmed, they are difficult to eradicate. To
reduce and manage the damage inflicted by the pathogen, fast and reliable disease
management protocols are required. Tests that enable the rapid and reliable
identification of the pathogen assist greatly in disease management.

Phytophthora species are traditionally not only detected by baiting but also by plating of
symptomatic tissue on selective media. Species can be identified by the characteristics
of the mycelium growing out of the bait. However, the method is low throughput,
labour intensive, and prone to false negatives. An alternative approach would be to
detect the pathogen by the presence of its DNA. This involves amplification of the
pathogen DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and detection of the
amplification product. Detection is usually by agarose gel electrophoresis. However,
this is also a labour intensive process involving pouring, loading, running, and staining
of the gels. The aim of this thesis is to explore the use of Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption/ Ionisation Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for detection
of PCR products. This procedure enables the analysis of large numbers of samples
within a very short time-frame as the average time for analysis of each sample is in the
order of milliseconds.

The assay involves annealing an extension (genotyping) primer to the PCR product and
its extension by a single nucleotide. The nature of the nucleotide added differentiates
species as does the site to which the primer anneals. Multiple extension (genotyping)
primers can be used together in a single reaction for detection of multiple species. In
this project four genotyping primers (GPs) were designed from the ITS regions of
Phytophthora palmivora, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Phytophthora citricola, and
Phytophthora cambivora.

The extension primers were tested for their specificity on the DNA of the target species.
The four primers designed were specific for their intended targets except for GPpalm3
which in addition to being extended by ddT when tested with DNA from P. palmivora,
was also extended by ddC when tested with DNA from other species of Phytophthora
or Pythium.

These primers were also tested for their ability to detect multiple Phytophthora species
in a single reaction (multiplexing). Mixtures of primers were added to mixed DNA
templates and the primer extension reaction carried out. The primers were designed so
that their masses were sufficiently different for them to be identified from a mixture.
Six replicates were analysed for each reaction. In general only about 1-3 of the six
replicates gave a positive reaction. This indicates that there may be some interference
between primers, or that the presence of all four nucleotides interfered with the primer
extension reaction. Increasing either the amount of enzyme, the amount of nucleotides
or both did not improve the results.

The sensitivity of detection was tested by the addition of different amounts of mycelium
to soil. The detection sensitivity depended on the primer pair used for PCR
amplification. The ITS1/2 primer pair was more sensitive than the ITS1/4 pair. The
limit of detection was 1 &#236;g mycelium g soil-1. However using nested PCR, levels of
sensitivity comparable to those obtained using the ITS1/2 primer pair could be
achieved. Primers to other regions of the genome such as the beta cinnamomin elicitin
gene gave very low levels of sensitivity compared to the ITS primers.

In comparison with DNA detection we found that the limit of detection using baiting
was 4 &#236;g mycelium g soil-1. Results below this limit were unreliable. The method
suffered from the additional disadvantage that it took a long time in comparison to DNA
detection.

DNA detection methods do not distinguish between living and dead organisms in the
soil. However it can be hypothesised that DNA is unlikely to persist for any significant
length of time in soil. To test this, we added plasmid DNA to soil and tested the
persistence of this DNA using a variety of methods such as precipitation of labelled
DNA, southern blotting and PCR amplification. It was found that in general, in soils
from different ecosystems, the bulk of the DNA was undetectable after 24 hours. The
rate of DNA breakdown differed with the soil type. In some soils, the added DNA was
not detected even after 2 hours, whereas in others it could be observed after 10 hours.
The detection depended on the method. Southern blotting showed that although DNA
could be observed at 10 hours, by 24 hours it was completely degraded. In contrast a
PCR product could be obtained from the soil extracts up to 24 hours. In a separate
experiment, plasmid DNA was detectable over a 24 hour incubation period in 5 soil
samples from 5 different sites. The results suggest that DNA is degraded rapidly in soil
and is unlikely to persist longer than 24 hours.

The results in this thesis demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS is a suitable alternative to
agarose gel electrophoresis for analysis of PCR products. The technique is rapid,
differentiates species from mixtures, is high-throughput and amenable to automation.
Implementation will require further research to automate the primer extension assay to
reduce the sensitivity to impurities in the DNA and to design parameters for sampling
asymptomatic material.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.125452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental research on application of sub-surface flow constructed wetlands for meat processing industry effluent treatment and nutrient removal</field><field name="creator">rkurup@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Meat processing industries produce large volumes of high strength wastewater.
Conventional technologies used in Australia and similar countries for treatment of
effluent from meat processing and similar industries, such as wineries and processed
food industry, are treatment ponds with or without a mechanical treatment system.

A properly designed activated sludge treatment system would be capable of biological
removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in addition to BOD5. These systems, however,
require substantial electrical power, skilled operational support and produce large
quantities of biosolids or sludge which require further on-site treatment or off site
disposal. Application of sub-surface flow constructed wetland (SSF-CW) systems could
provide a sustainable solution for treatment of meat processing industry effluent and
other similar high strength wastewaters. There are, however, only very limited studies
on application of SSF-CW for secondary treatment of high strength wastewaters.
Although there have been a number of cases where SSF-CW have been used as the
secondary treatment unit for municipal wastewater, this technology has not still become
a common practice for the same purpose in Australia. Most of the applications are for
either polishing of secondary or tertiary treated municipal wastewater or for greywater
treatment.

This research was funded by National Meat Industry Advisory Council (MINTRAC).
Sustainable wastewater treatment has been taken up as a very important issue by meat
industry. The industry provides Ph.D research scholarships through MINTRAC to
develop new technologies for wastewater treatment and nutrient removal from meat
processing effluent.

The main objective of the research was to develop process engineering design
parameters for sub-surface flow constructed wetland (SSF-CW) with Monto vetiver
(Vetiveria zizanioides recently reclassified as Chrysopogon zizanioides) as the emergent
vegetation for treatment of high strength, nutrient rich wastewater. The study also
investigated the phosphorus retention properties of pea gravel for use in SSF-CW
system as bed media or as an external phosphorus removal system for meat processing
industry effluent. In addition, chemical methods for phosphorus removal from meat
processing industry effluent were also investigated.

The thesis is based on experimental research. The research consisted of three types of
experimental set up; a) using two laboratory experimental SSF-CW reactors (one with
vetiver grass and the other reactor with no vegetation) in a greenhouse with batch
feeding of artificial wastewater that simulates meat industry effluent, b) experiment with
pea gravel of different particle sizes and solutions of different phosphorus (P)
concentrations in a constant temperature room, c) laboratory experiment using actual
meat processing industry effluent with alum and sodium aluminate for P removal.

The structure of the thesis is as follows. Following the Introduction is the section of
Literature Review, then sections on the experiments that follow a journal paper format,
followed by a General Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations. A list of
references is provided at the end of the thesis.

The literature review section has four chapters (Chapter 2 to Chapter 5). Chapter 2
describes a review of meat processing industry effluent characteristics and current
treatment technologies. Chapter 3 is a critical review of current literature on COD
removal using sub-surface flow constructed wetlands (SSF-CW). Chapter 4 and 5
describe a review of various processes and models on the fate of nitrogen and
phosphorus in SSF-CW system respectively.

Chapters 6 to 10 deal with experimental research part of the thesis. Chapters, 6, 7 and 8
share a common methodology section which is described in Chapter 6. Results of the
batch experiments with the laboratory SSF-CW systems on COD removal, nitrogen
removal and phosphorus retention are discussed in Chapters 6, 7 and 8 respectively.
Chapter 9 explains a detailed experimental study on phosphorus adsorption dynamics of
pea gravel. Chapter 10 discusses the results on experiments using sodium aluminate and
aluminium sulphate for P removal from meat processing industry effluent as an alternate
P removal method for such effluent.

An overview of the major results of the experimental section is discussed in chapter 11,
in the General Discussion section. Conclusions and Recommendations of the research
are provided in Chapter 12.

In this study, it was observed that Monto vetiver grass performed better during
nitrification than in denitrification, where the plant did not survive. Ammonium N
removal followed a first order decay in both vegetated and un-vegetated experimental
SSF-CW system with average removal ranging from 40 to 60 % of the influent.
Denitrification was found to be the pathway for nitrate removal. As long as the carbon
source was available, the denitrification followed a first order exponential decay, with
over 80% of nitrate was removed in 48 hours. Vetiver grass sustained elevated
ammonium levels of approximately 200 mg/L or more, however it was under stress
during denitrification and it eventually died.

The experimental SSF-CW systems with pea gravel as bed media could effectively
retain soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the wetland cells during experiments of
COD reduction and nitrification (with ammonia and high COD input). However, during
denitrification study, both experimental SSF-CW cells did not show significant removal
of SRP from wastewater. The vegetated cell removed nearly 50% of the input SRP,
however, the un-vegetated cell did not show any trend for SRP removal, and in some
cases the effluent SRP was nearly 90% of the input value.

The role of Monto vetiver grass for N and P removal was found to be very minor and
this study concluded that nutrient removal (N &amp; P) by plant uptake could be neglected
in the design of SSF-CW system with Monto vetiver grass.

Adsorption is the major mechanism for P removal from the experimental SSF-CW
systems, where pea gravel was used as bed media. The P adsorption capacity of pea
gravel increased with decrease in particle size. For 16 to 18 mm, the Langmuir
adsorption maximum was 99 mg/kg, whereas for very fine pea gravel powder (&lt;150
&#236;m) the maximum adsorption observed experimentally was 3950 mg/kg. In a typical
wetland with pea gravel as bed media for meat processing industry, the media would be
capable of P retention for about 2 to 3 years of operation. Supplementary chemical
removal method is needed for sustainable P removal once the adsorption maximum of
wetland cell is reached.

A chemical P removal system using liquid alum and NaOH for pH stabilisation is more
appropriate than sodium aluminate. Application of sodium aluminate for P removal for
meat processing industry effluent is found to be less effective as it would need higher
dosage, longer settling period, coloured supernatant, acid addition for pH adjustment.
Liquid alum application rate is recommended to be between a molar ratio of Al: P of 3
for TP value of &lt;1 mg/L in the treated effluent.

This research study concludes that horizontal flow SSF-CW system with Monto vetiver
grass is suitable for COD removal and nitrification from high strength wastewater.
Current design equation of horizontal flow SSF-CW system is mostly plug flow
exponential decay method, but in this study, it has been concluded that retarded first
order rate constant is the most appropriate design method for horizontal flow SSF-CW
system for COD removal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wetlands</field><field name="subject">Sewage</field><field name="subject">Biological treatment</field><field name="subject">Purification</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.142408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational culture in TAFE colleges : power, gender and identity politics</field><field name="creator">jane.lorrimar@challengertafe.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study explores the human face of workplace change in two Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges in Western Australia. It analyses the impact of neoliberalism on organisational culture by examining the way vocational education and training (VET) reforms influenced the restructuring and orientation of these colleges, and changed their power dynamics and work practices. It presents the accounts of 100 women and men who were interviewed between 2000-2002 about their working lives. Their stories of passion and angst represent a &#145;vertical slice&#146; of life in TAFE and include responses from administrative staff, lecturers, academic managers, corporate services managers and executives.

This study explores perceptions of power and the mechanisms of control that were exerted upon and within the colleges with a focus on the factors that impact on career satisfaction. In addition, it examines perceptions of fairness in relation to employment, remuneration and promotion issues. Specifically, it reveals a variety of points of view on the attributes of success and outlines the strategies individuals use to get ahead. Furthermore, it seeks to understand the way values and norms guide and justify conduct and how they influence organisational culture. It evaluates whether a climate of sacrifice operates in the colleges and whether individuals will sacrifice personal or professional values to get ahead.

Although much has been written on the impact of neoliberalism on the changing nature of work and organisational culture, there has been little investigation of the TAFE &#145;experience&#146; at the individual, group and institutional level. It is also less common to find analyses of workplace restructuring that conceptualises the changes from a feminist and sociocultural perspective. By investigating the colleges as sites of gender and identity politics, this study explores the way individuals and groups do gender and describes how gender asymmetry is reproduced through social, cultural and institutional practices. It highlights how individuals construct their professional and worker identity and perceive themselves in relations to others in the social and organisational hierarchy of the colleges.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technical Education</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">TAFE colleges</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.145611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphite induces morphological and molecular changes in Phytophthora species</field><field name="creator">30365216@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The influence of the chemical phosphite on Phytophthora species was investigated by
studying the morphological and molecular changes induced by phosphite.

In vitro experiments were conducted to study the effects of phosphite on five isolates of
each of five species of Phytophthora grown in low phosphate defined medium. Sensitivity
to phosphite varied greatly among the five isolates of each species and resulted in a
significant interaction between isolate and phosphite effect. The EC50 values ranged from
less than 5 to 10 &#236;g/ml for P. cinnamomi, to 13 &#236;g/ml for P. nicotianae, to 27 &#236;g/ml for P.
citricola, to 24 &#236;g/ml for P. palmivora and to 49 &#236;g/ml for P. capsici.

Phosphite concentrations from 5 to 100 &#236;g/ml caused different degrees of morphological
changes. Mycelial growth of all species was significantly suppressed by phosphite at 5
&#236;g/ml while at 100 &#236;g/ml there was hyphal lysis. Swelling of hyphae with stunted sidebranches
and shrinking of cytoplasm from hyphal tips and hyphal walls were characteristic
changes observed. Phosphite also retarded the development and caused distortion and lysis
of chlamydospores, sporangia and zoospores. Zoosporogenesis was also adversely
affected.

Differential display reverse transcription-PCR was used to study changes in gene
expression in P. cinnamomi induced in response to phosphite stress. The differential
conditions were simulated by growth on a defined medium with and without phosphite
amendment. This technique resulted in the isolation of 34 putative differentially expressed
cDNA fragments which were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequences of 26 of these
cDNA clones were generated. BLASTX analysis of these nucleotide sequences against the
NCBI database revealed that 18 exhibited homology to gene sequences encoding known
proteins involved in various biological processes. The remaining eight showed homology to
either hypothetical or unknown or unnamed proteins.

The expression level of four of these cDNA clones were further analysed by real-time
quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green 1 assay. Three candidate endogenous reference
genes namely, tubulin, cyclophilin and actin were evaluated to determine their expression
level under the influence of phosphite. None of these genes were significantly regulated by
phosphite. As tubulin had the highest expression among the three, it was chosen as the
endogenous reference gene. Amplification efficiencies between the reference gene and
each of the target genes were validated and found to be approximately equal or within 5%
of each other. The relative gene expression between the phosphite-treated and untreated
samples can thus be determined using the comparative CT (&#196;&#196;CT) method. One of the
cDNA clones, CP6 which showed differential expression of three-fold was up-regulated.
The remaining three were constitutively expressed. CP6 which encodes 1564 nucleotides
showed sequence homology, at the amino acid level with proteophosphoglycans from
Leishmania major.

This study demonstrated the growth inhibition and morphological deformities caused by
phosphite in Phytophthora species. It also illustrated the use of a modified DDRT-PCR
method to study genes expressed in phosphite stress regulation. The application of real-time
quantitative RT-PCR with SYBR Green I assay facilitated the quantification of the
expression level of some of these genes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophtora Diseases</field><field name="subject">Phosphonates</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.155119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting for unit of scale in standard setting methodologies</field><field name="creator">sandy.heldsinger@uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Substantial sums of money are invested by governments in state, national and international testing programs. Australia in particular engages at all three levels. There are number of purposes served by these programs. One of these is to report student performance against standards.

Standard setting exercises with respect to a particular assessment are commonly used by testing programs where there is a requirement to determine the point at which it can be said that students have demonstrated achievement of a standard. Several methodologies have been devised that use expert judgements to derive a numerical cut-score on an achievement scale. A commonly used standard setting methodology is one proposed by Angoff (1971).

The kernel of the Angoff procedure is the independent judgement of the probability that a minimally competent person can or cannot answer a dichotomously scored item correctly. This methodology typically involves three stages: orientation and training, a first round of performance estimation followed by feedback, and then a second round of performance estimation. In the orientation session, judges are asked to define a hypothetical target group. This definition is dependent upon the judges&#146; tacit understanding of the standard. For example, in the context of a mathematics test, judges would be asked to agree the skills the students should be expected to have mastered. Then they would be asked to envisage a student with those skills and to estimate the proportion of a hypothetical group of equally competent students (as defined by the expected standard) who would answer each item correctly. This proportion is the estimate of the required probability. Then the sum of these probabilities is taken as the raw cut-score on a test composed of the items.

Several studies, however, question the validity of the Angoff methodology because of the finding that judges were unable to perform the fundamental task required of them: to estimate the probability a student would answer an item correctly, (Shepard, 1995) even for groups of students who are well known to them (Impara and Blake, 1996). 

In addition, standard-setting exercises invariably take place in situations where the reporting of educational standards has a high profile and is of political importance. To address the accountability requirements that accompany such a task, a wide range of stakeholders are invited to act as judges in the exercises. Inevitably, however, variability between the judges conception of the standard, as represented by the cut-score set by each of them, causes concern. Can the public have confidence in the standard set if the judges themselves cannot agree? Several studies report the introduction of further rounds of performance estimation and more refined feedback in an attempt to obtain greater consistency between the judges&#146; ratings (Impara and Blake, 2000; McGinty and Neel, 1996; Reckase, 2000).

In more recent studies Green, Trimble and Lewis (2003) report a study in which three standard setting procedures were implemented to set cut-scores and which required judges to synthesise the results to establish final cut-points. Green et al report studies such as Impara and Blake (2000) where convergence of results among multiple standard settings are used as evidence of validity of cut-scores, but note that while convergence may occur to a reasonable degree when variations of the same method are used, there are few reports of convergence when different procedures are used.

The distinguishing factor between the standard-setting exercises reported in the literature, which rely on judges&#146; tacit understanding of the standard and this study, is the existence of an explicitly and operationally defined standard. In 1996 the Australian Ministers for Education agreed to a national framework for reporting of student achievement in literacy and numeracy and arising from this decision was the drafting of benchmark standards against which the achievement of students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 could be reported. The benchmark standards are articulated in two components. Criteria describe the skills that students need to have acquired if it is to be said that they achieved the standard and sample work exemplify these criteria. 

The setting of standards independently of placing them on a scale permitted a more rigorous assessment of the effects of different designs on the setting of cut-scores.  Two different standard-setting methodologies have been employed in this study to translate descriptions of the standards into cut-scores. One draws on the Angoff method and involves the use of a rating scale. Judges consider the items of a test and indicate the probability that a student at the cut-score will answer each item correctly.  The probabilities are in increments of 0.10, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The sum of the probabilities that a judge gives to the items is taken as the raw score cut-score from that judge. The second study involves a method of pairwise comparison of the same items together with items that are operationalised to be benchmark items.  The judge has to decide which of each pair of items is the more difficult. 

The results of the two benchmark setting designs appear to support findings from other standard-setting exercises reported in the literature. Namely,

i.	Judges were unable to estimate absolute item difficulty for a student of prescribed ability.
ii.	Where two different designs were used, there is no convergence in results.
iii.	Ratings from different judges within each design varied widely.

To indicate the resultant discrepancy in setting the benchmark on the same test, the rating methodology gives a value of 16.08 and the pairwise a value of 7.10 on ostensibly the same scale. A closer examination of the judges&#146; ratings, however, suggests that despite the evidence of dramatically different cut scores between the two exercises, the judges were highly consistent in their interpretation of relative item difficulty. Two lines of evidence indicate this high level of internal consistency: (i) the reliability index for the pairwise data; and (ii) the correlation between the item estimates obtained from the rating and pairwise exercises, which was 0.95. In addition, the correlation of the relative item difficulties with those obtained from students responding to the same items was a satisfactory 0.80 and 0.74 for the ratings and for the pairwise designs, respectively.

The high correlation between judgements across the two exercises, in conjunction with the relatively high correlation of the item difficulties from the judges&#146; data and from the student data, suggests that problems observed in the literature do not arise because judges cannot differentiate the relative difficulties of the items.  Accordingly, the unit of scale as assessed by the standard deviations of the item difficulties were calculated and examined. 

The standard deviation of the items from judges in the likelihood design was half that of the item difficulties from the student responses, and the standard deviation of the items from the pairwise design was over twice that of the student scale. The substantial difference between the standard deviations suggests a difference between the units of scale, which presents a fundamental problem for common equating. In general, and in the literature, it seems that the unit of scale as evidenced from the standard deviations is not considered and it seems that it is simply assumed that the unit of scale produced by the students and the judges is the same and each design should be the same.  Then if the results of different modes of the data collections do not arrive at the same or very similar cut-scores, it is not considered that this might be only a result of different units of scale.

In retrospect, it is not surprising that different formats for data collection produce different units of scale, and that different cut-scores result. In addition, it is not surprising that these might also produce a different unit of scale from that produced by the responses of the students.  The reasons that the different designs are likely to produce different units of scale are considered in the thesis. 

Differences in the unit of scale will inevitably have an impact on the location of the benchmark or cut-score.  When the difference in standard deviation is accounted for, and the cut-scores are placed on the same scale as that produced by the students, the two exercises provide similar locations of the benchmark cut-score. Importantly, the thesis shows that these locations can be substantiated qualitatively as representing the defined standard. There are two main conclusions of the study. First, some of the problems reported in the literature in setting benchmarks can be attributed to difference in the units of scale in the various response formats of judges relative to those of students. Second, this difference in unit of scale needs to be taken into account when locating the standard on the student scale.  

This thesis describes in detail the two cut-score setting designs for the data collection, and the transformations that are necessary in order to locate the benchmark on the same scale as that produced by the responses of the students.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education Standards</field><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Numeracy</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.160817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the developmental influences that shape the contemporary practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors.</field><field name="creator">stephen.truscott@fullnessoflife.org</field><field name="description">This study explores the similar and different developmental influences that shape the practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors. An examination of the contemporary literature on spiritual direction finds that in the main, two developmental influences shape the practice of contemporary spiritual directors: their capacity to adopt a contemplative stance towards their directees and their ability to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. While the review highlights the presence of these two influences, the literature is deficient in understanding the similarities and differences in how these two influences shape the practice of beginning and advanced spiritual directors. To address the deficiency, this study reviews three groups of Western Australian spiritual directors, Anglican, Churches of Christ and Roman Catholic. The investigation takes a qualitative, ethnographic approach, using focus groups. An analysis and discussion of the data confirms that the similarities and differences in the influences that shape their practice revolve around two key developmental influences namely, the capacity of directors to adopt a contemplative stance to their directees, and their ability to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. While both influences shape beginning and advanced directors, the former impacts more on the practice of beginning directors and the latter more affects advanced directors. 

Two factors may initiate and sustain the capacity of directors to adopt a contemplative stance. First, directors grow by noticing and attending to all the dimensions of their human experience. Second, directors develop by having their experience attended to in some form of therapeutic relationship or through participation in various developmental group processes. 

Directors may enhance their capacity to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment through understanding paradigms about spiritual direction practice and spiritual development. Their appreciation of paradigms about spiritual direction may derive from two sources. The first is by how they distinguish more effectively spiritual direction from other therapeutic practices. The second is by how they grow in understanding relevant theological, philosophical, and psychological perspectives that inform good practice. Directors may further increase their comprehension of interpretive frameworks about spiritual development by redressing the attitudinal effects of fundamentalism and incorporating a multiplicity of approaches to spirituality. Training programmes are an important means to introduce and develop directors&#146; abilities to be aware contextually of the factors that fashion the dynamic of accompaniment. A person&#146;s ecclesial role may influence the context in which a director commences practice. From this discussion, this study draws conclusions and offers recommendations applicable to practice and research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spiritual direction</field><field name="subject">spiritual director</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">spiritual</field><field name="subject">beginning director</field><field name="subject">advanced director</field><field name="subject">contemplative stance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070722.150153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effectiveness of parental provisioning under variable oceanographic conditions along the Western Australian coast in two shearwater species : the little shearwater Puffinus assimilis tunneyi and the wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus</field><field name="creator">19006626@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Parental provisioning was investigated in two congeneric shearwater species, the
winter breeding Little Shearwater Puffinus assimilis tunneyi and summer breeding
Wedge-tailed Shearwater Puffinus pacificus. The Western Australian coast is
characterised by climatic and oceanographic instability largely linked to the variable
flow rate of the Leeuwin Current generated by differences in global climatic
conditions. Ongoing long-term studies at the Western Australian coast have indicated
that this climate driven phenomenon affects seabird reproductive participation and
success. Such an ongoing, parallel study of Wedge-tailed Shearwater reproduction
effectively provided this thesis with a background index of oceanographic conditions,
or a context in which to view and interpret the ability of adults to provide parental
care to the dependent nestling. Such an index of oceanographic conditions is
generally lacking in studies of seabird provisioning. Fortuitously, this study was
conducted in what appeared to be a favourable year (2000), a transition year (2001)
and a less favourable year (2002) for seabird reproduction off the Western Australian
coast. Consequently, it was possible to comment on the effectiveness of parental
provisioning during different oceanographic conditions.

In this thesis, parental provisioning encompassed the delivery of a range of resources
to the dependent nestling, including a burrow, heat during incubation, protection from
predators, brooding after hatching, and the delivery of food to sustain growth and
development. The main focus of the study was the nestling feeding stage, although
other more sensitive and less flexible phases were investigated in the Little
Shearwater. Most research focused on the winter breeding Little Shearwater, as the species least studied. Adult Little Shearwaters were present at the nest throughout the
night during the nestling feeding period, which presented the opportunity to examine
provisioning from an adult perspective. Adult responses are discussed in the context
of this index of oceanographic condition, in terms of regional food resources levels,
and also more localised weather patterns which facilitate shearwater locomotion. A
potential two-tier adult state-dependent mechanism of parental resource allocation is
presented, which would allow a mobile K-strategist, foraging within an acceptable
distance from the breeding colony, to persist in this relatively unstable and unpredictable environment.

This research suggests that parents&#146; adjusted parental provisioning in order to
minimise risks to the functional adult, which had attained its reproductive potential at
the expense of the nestling that may or may not attain reproductive status. The
weights of adult encountered at the colony did not differ significantly between
different phases of the breeding season (pre-laying, incubation and nestling feeding)
or between years. It appeared as if the weights of adults engaged in parental provision
fluctuated within an acceptable &#147;working&#148; range whilst present at the colony, which
makes it difficult to define average adult weights. The theory of threshold adult body
condition suggests that only adults above a sufficient body condition are allocating
resources towards reproduction, and therefore present at the breeding colony. Whilst,
adults below a threshold are expected to be absent from the colony and therefore not
willing to allocate resources to support the dependent nestling.

In the two-tier adult state dependent allocation of parental care, firstly the body
condition of the adult will determine if it is present at the colony, hence providing care for the offspring. Secondly if the adult is able to maintain adult body condition
provisioning can be reactive to the needs (or body condition) of the nestling.
Evidently, such a system of parental provisioning predominantly based on the ability
to maintain adult body condition will be affected by differences in oceanographic and
climatic conditions, which affect the ability of adults to maintain or replenish body
condition within an acceptable time and distance away from the colony. The level
and continuity of parental care provided by the pair will be discussed, especially how
deviations from an optimal provisioning schedule may affect nestling growth, survival and viability.

Ongoing, long term research of summer breeding Wedge-tailed Shearwaters along the
Western Australian coast suggests that reproduction is adversely affected by
prevailing negative southern oscillation indices and associated declines in the flow
rate of the warm, low density Leeuwin Current. Despite breeding in the austral winter
when the maximal flow rates of the Leeuwin Current are expected, Little Shearwater
reproduction was also affected in a manner similar to that documented for tropical
seabirds breeding in summer. Furthermore, decreases in productivity registered by
local fisheries suggested that observed declines in seabird reproduction may be linked
to an overall crash in productivity experienced along the Western Australian coast
during years of weak Leeuwin Current flow. Such years are associated with more
uniform and cold offshore water temperatures. Consequently, a regional lack of
oceanographic resources, within an acceptable distance of the breeding site, are likely
to adversely affect the ability of adults to replenish body condition, however other
factors such as prevailing weather are also likely to affect energy expenditure during travel and foraging. Both factors would affect the ability of adults&#146; to maintain body conditions.

In a favourable year, Little Shearwaters were able to meet nestling needs and the
amount of food delivered matched the pattern of weight gain typical for
Procellariiform young. Conversely, in a less favourable year, Little Shearwaters
delivered food to young less often and the amount delivered was erratic, as the
percentage of nestlings fed was consistently lower and temporal delivery was more
irregular in the less favourable year. Nonetheless, food delivery also changed with
nestling age, following a pattern similar to a favourable year, but at a lower rate.

Future research should focus on the level of obesity attained by cohorts under
different conditions and possibly the quality of feathers produced by nestlings.
Feather quality and the state of obesity attained may affect the post-fledging buffer
and ultimately affect fledging survival.
Supplementary feeding suggested that adult Wedge-tailed Shearwaters adjusted
feeding in response to proximal needs of nestlings, as supplementary fed nestlings
were fed less than non-supplementary fed nestling. Furthermore, in both species
adults changed provisioning to meet the changing needs of nestlings throughout
ontogeny however the adult&#146;s ability to respond to changing needs may be dependent
upon the body condition of the adult and therefore ultimately dictated by resource
availability. These results are in accord with other studies in which adults have
altered provisioning in response to changing nestling needs. Whilst in other studies
adults displayed an inability to react to nestling needs, which may have been linked to the difficulty faced by adult to maintain their own body condition during a less
favourable year.

The tentative mechanism of parental provisioning may help to explain the often
contradictory outcomes recorded in studies of parental provisioning conducted in the
absence of an indicator of resources availability and context in which to interpret
adult response. Since, adults adjusted provisioning to firstly match their ability to
maintain their own body condition in response to oceanographic conditions and
secondly if able to met their own needs, in accordance with nestling needs.
Therefore, parental provisioning is a flexible, state-dependent behaviour ultimately
limited by oceanographic conditions.
Once nestlings have hatched and passed a critical weight, they are more likely to
survive and parental provisioning has the potential to become a highly flexible
behaviour as the offspring can absorb periods of reduced parental provisioning. This
relatively &#147;forgiving&#148; nestling phase is often targeted by studies of parental
provisioning. Here, an optimal provisioning schedule may be orchestrated under
favourable conditions however deviations may be absorbed without terminating the investment in reproduction.

Although breeding at different times of the year, both species fed their nestling to a
stage of obesity. This occurred, despite feeding nestlings near daily, which should
have allowed adults to obtain regular feedback about the body condition of the
nestling. Obesity may reflect the relatively unpredictable availability of resources
along the Western Australian coast. However, adults may aim to increase the potential fitness of the nestling when adult body condition allows, through the
provision of a post fledging buffer in terms of stored energy and high quality, structurally sound plumage.

At the Western Australian coast, Little Shearwaters used a bimodal strategy to care
for nestlings during incubation and feeding. Adults lost weight during periods of
intensive provisioning, namely incubation and nestling feeding, but if too much
weight was lost, provisioning was withheld and adults departed for a longer absence.
Whilst absent from the colony for a prolonged period of time adults gained weight,
both during the incubation and nestling feeding period. Return of birds from long
absences appeared to be related to the predictable passage of weather systems.

In Little Shearwater, during incubation the efforts of both parents were highly coordinated
in a favourable year, since egg neglect was low, presumably as a
consequence of predation pressure. Weather appeared to assist in the arrival of the
relieving adult during incubation. Similarly during the transition to nestling feeding,
the nocturnal activity at the breeding site indicated that the return of adults from long
absences was associated with predictable changes in wind direction, related to the
inevitable passage of weather systems, rather than wind strength, which is directly
proportional to pressure differences between adjacent weather systems.

In a favourable year, during nestling feeding the co-ordination of change overs
between individuals within a pair also appeared to be high. Consequently, patterns of
provisioning may be entrained throughout the duration of the breeding season,
including incubation and nestling feeding, by an underlying pattern generated by the predictable passage of weather systems. Adults able to meet their own needs in a time
frame dictated by the movement of weather system may minimise travel costs, whilst
returning in time to allow the partner to depart to meet its needs. Both partners are
required for the co-ordination of parental care to produce an optimal provisioning
schedule. Consequently, activities are expected to be structured to protect not only
the body condition of the self, but also of the partner in a species where biparental
care is generally required to successfully raise an offspring.

During nestling feeding, in a favourable year the co-ordinated bimodal strategy
achieved near daily delivery of food, whilst in a less favourable year deviations from
this pattern occurred, as adults spent more time at sea. The average duration of long
absences, used to replenish body condition, appeared to increase during less
favourable years. Further research should focus on variations in temporal absences
and adult weights under different conditions that affect the ability of adults to
replenish their body conditions. Furthermore, not all pairs were able to achieve daily
food delivery during each year, and during a less favourable year a larger proportion
of the breeding population appeared to be unable to deliver continuous parental care.
Consequently, a larger proportion of nestlings remained unfed. The disruption in the
input system, or deviations from a potentially optimal provisioning schedule, resulted
in differences in growth rates between years. Costs incurred by adults during less
favourable conditions appeared to be passed on to the nestling, whilst the risks to the
functional adult that had reached reproductive potential were minimised.

Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, breeding during the austral summer in a favourable year,
were able to meet nestling needs. Here, food was delivered at a pattern that matched weight gain, where total overnight food delivered changed with nestling age, as in the
Little Shearwaters. Wedge-tailed Shearwaters did not deliver food as regularly as
Little Shearwaters. The colony of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters appeared to experience
periods of reduced provisioning, during low wind conditions associated with
dissipating tropical lows. During such conditions, Wedge-tailed Shearwater adults
were often seen rafting at sea away from the breeding site suggesting it was energy
expensive to fly. Such periods of poor provisioning associated with low wind speeds
were recorded at different latitudes along the Western Australian coast and in
different years. Dissipating tropical lows which generate low wind conditions are a
seasonal occurrence however the frequency, persistence and intensity of such tropical
lows appeared to fluctuate with offshore sea surface temperatures, frequency of
tropical cyclones to the north and ultimately prevailing large scale climatic conditions
that affect seas surface temperatures. Consequently, prevailing short term weather
conditions which are affected by large scale climatic events, including climate
change, have the potential to influence Wedge-tailed Shearwater reproduction.

Wedge-tailed Shearwater nestlings supplementarily fed during a dissipating tropical
low were visited and fed less than unfed nestlings of lower body condition. This
implies that adults adjusted provisioning in accordance with nestling body condition.
However, nestlings that had not been supplementarily fed were visited less often once
conditions improved, suggesting that parents were unable to sustain food delivery.
Parents of supplementarily fed nestlings, which had reduced provisioning during the
adverse conditions, were able to feed their nestlings at a higher rate once conditions
recovered then parents with non-supplementary fed nestlings. Thus, parents appeared
to adjust provisioning in relation to nestling body condition however the ability of adults to maintain high levels of parental care appears to be limited, possibly by
parental body condition. Similarly, adults reacted to the changing needs of a nestling
throughout ontogeny in a favourable year, whilst during an adverse year deviation
from a more optimal pattern of provisioning was evident.
Meal sizes delivered by different species are often compared. However, food delivery
appears to be adjusted with nestling age and differences in oceanographic conditions.

Consequently, an optimal amount of food matching the developmental needs of the
nestling may be met during optimal conditions using an optimal pattern of
provisioning, whilst deviations from this may give an index of parental inability to
cope with long or short-term deterioration in oceanic conditions, which ultimately
affect their ability to meet adult needs. Furthermore, meal sizes are often determined
during frequent weighing research of short duration, which is easily affected by
proximal conditions that could affect the ability of adults to travel and would reflect
the developmental stage of the nestling. Therefore, for meal sizes quoted it is not
know if adults were able to engage in an optimal provisioning schedule or if
deviations occur to compensate for below optimal conditions.

Comparison of meal size by weight alone may not be feasible, even throughout a
season within a species, as a seasonal shift in diet was recorded for Wedge-tailed
Shearwaters during the breeding season using stable isotope. The different diets of
different species often living in different geographic locations and the ability of some
species to produce stomach oil, further confounds the ability to compare meal sizes by
weight alone. It appears difficult to define a meal size characteristic for a species and
make direct comparisons based on weight alone a practice widespread in seabird research. At best an optimal meal size for a given developmental stage may be used
in conjunction with calorific values to calculate an optimal energy input for a specific age to compare between species.

The seasonal difference in diet recorded during the Wedge-tailed Shearwater breeding
season revealed a shift from a higher to a lower trophic level. This is consistent with
females engaging in a pre-laying exodus where preferred resources may be targeted,
whilst during nestling feeding foraging constraints are introduced as foraging occurs
around a central location. A broader range of prey may be targeted within an
acceptable distance from the breeding colony, including scavenging behind Western
Rock Lobster fishing vessels which provide a predictable source of food &#150; or discarded often imported bait.

The application of stable isotope analysis provided promising insights into shearwater
foraging behaviour otherwise difficult to elucidate. Different resources were targeted
by the two species during egg membrane formation. Wedge-tailed Shearwaters
generally appeared to forage at a higher trophic level than Little Shearwaters,
although outliers suggest that Little Shearwaters also have the potential to target
higher trophic levels. Differences in diet during egg formation were evident between
different colonies of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters breeding at different locations.

Consequently, stable isotope analysis may be used to track changes in diet between
favourable and less favourable years, where increased foraging constraints are
expected to emerge. Stable isotope analysis is a promising technique and
interpretation of data will increase with further understanding of ecosystem dynamics
and the development of a reference library.
Direct observation at sea suggested that Little Shearwaters forage in deep, offshore in
areas most likely influenced by the Leeuwin Current. They were not observed to
forage in the cooler, inshore waters fed by a northwards flowing counter current, on
the continental shelf between the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and the mainland.
Maximum depth gauges revealed a maximal dive depth of approximately 34 m. The
maximal dive depths recorded appeared to increases with time spent at sea, as
indicated by birds engaged in short absences (near daily returns) from the colony and
long absences (approximately weekly returns) when they were replenishing body
condition. Long absences were recorded after an incubation shift or a period of daily nestling feeding.

To summarise, a tentative mechanism of adult state-dependent allocation of parental
provisioning in which pelagic seabirds persist in environments of fluctuating resource
levels was proposed. This may be based upon the ability of adults to operate above a
threshold body condition, which is ultimately dictated by resource availability and
proximal conditions which affect the ability of adults to maintain their own body
condition. Once adults struggle to maintain their body condition, a disruption in the
co-ordination of the parental care orchestrated between the members of a pair can
arise, as adults spend more time away from the colony replenishing their body
condition. This results in a deviation from an optimal provisioning schedule, which
is achievable in favourable years when resource levels and proximal conditions
facilitate easy maintenance of the pair&#146;s body condition. In this system, any costs
incurred whilst struggling to replenish or maintain adult body condition are passed on
to the nestling. In a system where biparental care is necessary, incentive exists for one partner to also act in a manner that facilitates the protection of the body condition of the other partner.

The nestling in turn may absorb such deviations from an optimal provisioning
schedule in a manner that affects the development of temporary attributes, rather than
fixed morphological attributes. This may be a testimony of the strong selective forces
exerted by the ocean, which also discourages sexual dimorphism in pelagic seabirds.
Reduced levels of provisioning recorded in less favourable years translated into lower
average peak weights, smaller growth rates and however asymptotes reached
generally did not differ significantly between years. However, the deviation from
the optimal provisioning schedule during less favourable years may reduce the fitness
of the fledgling, through a reduction in the post fledging buffer, including investment
in a smaller post fledging fat deposits and decreased plumage quality. It is possible,
that nestling shunt costs incurred away from skeletal or fixed attributes. The nestling
once independent may overcome lower quality plumage and a smaller post fledging
fat buffer, if conditions are favourable. Thereby, the offspring engages in its own risk
minimisation strategy and makes the most of its only chance for survival.

Within a species, temporal patterns of parent provisioning and consequently foraging
strategies are flexible. Firstly, a species may engage in a different foraging strategy
ranging from unimodal to bimodal in response to prevailing conditions at a given
location that affect the ability of adults to maintain their own body condition.
Consequently, even at the same location under different conditions a shift in foraging
strategy may result. Secondly, an optimal provisioning schedule able to meet the
needs of the nestling may only be realised during favourable conditions when a pair is able to co-ordinate their efforts. The proportion of the colony able to achieve optimal
provision is expected to vary between years and resource availability, as does the
proportion of the breeding population able to return to the colony and lay an egg.

Consequently, nestling quality of the cohort may be affected by the adult state
dependent input system, based upon adult risk minimisation. This has implications
for climate change, which affects sea surface temperatures and consequently
oceanographic productivity and prevailing weather patterns.
Effectively, costs are passed on to the offspring whilst the reproductive potential of
the adult or pair is maintained. Such flexibility allows iteroparous k-strategists, such
as shearwaters, to persist successfully in areas of climatic and oceanographic
variability, but may have implications on the post-fledging survival chances. In an
adverse year, despite reaching lower average weights, a proportion of adults were still
able to feed their nestlings to obesity, possibly highlighting differences in quality
between pairs. Since the state of obesity reached and the quality of feather produced
may translate into increased post-fledging survival chances for the nestling, the
survival chances of nestlings produced by a breeding population may not be equal, as
the level of parental care delivered may vary between pairs and years. The subtle
adjustments in two tier adult state-dependent system of parental provisioning may
alter the post-fledging survival chances of the cohort and this has implications on
population dynamics in terms of climate change, which reach beyond easily observed
reductions in breeding participation and success.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shearwaters</field><field name="subject">Breeding Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Puffinus</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070731.143826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Invention of the Environment as a Legal Subject</field><field name="creator">J.goodie@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The legal regulation of the environment is exemplary of the formation, practice and challenge of modern legal discourse and governance. The latter part of the twentieth century has seen the emergence of environmentalism and the problematisation of the environment in terms of the management of hazard and risk. The social authority of law has meant that it has been inevitably implicated in the contestation and negotiation of environmental governance. In turn, environmental governance and discourse have required a certain refiguring of legal rationality as legal discourse has been confronted by the immanent critique of environmentalism. This thesis will focus on how the environment emerged as problematic and how it came to be governed and of legal interest. Several examples of legal thinking concerning specific environmental problems are analysed, and the manner in which the environment is constructed within the legal discursive domain is examined.

Much modern knowledge and understanding regarding the environment developed in part from the specialisation of scientific discourse and experiment, which formed certain areas of expertise, including biology, ecology and toxicology. This scientific knowledge significantly contributed to governmental identification and elucidation of the environment. Modern ecology and associated technologies have facilitated the detailed mapping and auditing of physical environments, and have profoundly effected our modern appreciation of &#145;the environment&#146; as an interdependent, dynamic and potentially fragile web of interdependent physical zones, spaces and activities. Modern environmentalism has emerged through the application of this type of technical scientific knowledge, in combination with certain forms of &#145;environmental sensibility&#146; which treat the environment, not as a thing, or somehow &#145;out there&#146;, but as a dynamic process of which humans are a part, which has a history, an economy, and a power to transform and be transformed. The shape of modern environmental governance has been especially influenced by the scientific and ethical critique of environmentalism that connects the origin of ecological risks to technological application and commodity production. 

Throughout this thesis, specific aspects of the &#145;analytics of government&#146; or governmentality approach derived from Foucault&#146;s writing on governmentality are taken up. Governmentality theory is largely concerned with the contingent relationship between knowledge and power; thus, with analysing specific discourses and associated spaces within which differing knowledge and forms of thinking interrelate and resist each other. The contestation and negotiation associated with environmental governance has confronted legal discourse and led to a refiguring of legal rationality. Legal governance of the environment has stretched and unsettled legal orthodoxy, as the environment does not readily fit into any of the usual categories pertaining to legal rights and interests. The environment, as a legal subject, is not simply a physical space; it is a contingent and instrumental concept, determined by human activity, social values and legal and non-legal calculation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">envionment</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">legal discourse</field><field name="subject">governmentality theory</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">public interest</field><field name="subject">toxic-tort</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070815.131651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Examination Of Perceived Risk And Trust As Determinants Of Online Purchasing Behaviour: A Study Within The U.S.A Gemstone Industry</field><field name="creator">pin_005@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that there is a negative impact of perceived risk on trust and on the online purchasing behaviour of buyers. Other research suggests a positive impact.

Exploring whether such associations could be generalised within the complex, costly high risk and credence products such as gemstones has not been examined. This gap in the literature was addressed in this study. 

The results of the study suggest that perceived risk and trust are significant determinants of the online purchasing behaviour of gemstone buyers.   The study also shows that the type of Internet marketing strategy used by the seller (the place strategy) and the buyer&#146;s privacy, and security concerns influence a buyer&#146;s perceived risk to purchase gemstones online. Furthermore, Internet fraud protection has been found to be the only significant factor that has an influence on the buyer&#146;s trust to purchase gemstones online.

leading maritime groups in the Indonesian archipelago. They have played a major role in
indigenous shipping, and since the second half of the nineteenth century their importance in
this field has been second only to that of the Bugis and Makassarese. With their strong
maritime orientation and outward economy, the coastal Madurese contrast strongly with the
agricultural orientation of their near neighbours, the Javanese and the Balinese.

The first part of this thesis presents the Madurese in historical context vis-his the
Javanese and the maritime groups of Sulawesi. It then considers the various historical and
cultural-ecological factors which predisposed the coastal Madurese toward seafaring as a
livelihood, and which enabled them to eclipse their former rivals along the north coast of
Java. The main seafaring centres of Madura during the twentieth century are identified, with
these being in three distinct locations: the northwest coast, the southwest coast, and the
eastern islands of Madura. Special attention is paid to the two major commodities carried by
traditional Madurese vessels, salt and cattle, leading up to a more detailed consideration of
the major transport commodity from the 1960s until the present, timber.

The second part of thesis focuses on the role of the Madurese in the Java Sea timber
trade. A key aspect of this account is the struggle between timber importers and the state.
The legal aspects of the movement of timber are explained, along with their economic
significance for importers and vessel operators, and the changing degree of compliance with
the law from the early 1970s to the much stricter enforcement after the mid-1990s. From the
late 1990s until 2003 the focus becomes closer to reveal the inner workings of the timber
trade, with special attention paid to the rise of 'wild' ports on the isolated north coast of
Madura, as well as the difficulties faced by many Madurese vessel operators after the ethnic
conflict in Central Kalimantan in 2001. The profitability and risks of the perahu operators
and timber traders are explained, and career profiles of several prominent individuals are
presented.

The study ranges widely in its setting, including maritime villages around Madura,
perahu ports in Java, and timber ports in Kalimantan. It concludes that the traditional
approach to business of the Madurese is no longer appropriate, and that diversification and
change of approach are now necessary. The maritime entrepreneurs of East Madura have in
this respect been more successful than their counterparts in West Madura, and it is suggested
that this difference is linked to historical differences between the two areas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">perahu</field><field name="subject">madura</field><field name="subject">timber</field><field name="subject">kalimantan</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070820.113540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatty acid composition of pollen and the effect of two dominant fatty acids (linoleic and oleic) in pollen and flour diets on longevity and nutritional composition of honey bees (apis mellifera)</field><field name="creator">R.manning@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The size of the apiculture industry in Western Australia (W.A.) is one of the smallest in the nation but the production of pollen and honey per colony is the highest in Australia. The overwhelming value of the bee industry to the community is through pollination. The pollination service benefit provided by honey bees (Apis mellifera) in Australia has an estimated value of $AUS1.7 billion (1999 - 2000). The economic yields from crops, such as almonds and cucurbits, depend entirely on the activity of honey bees. 

Access to flora is essential to maintain productive colonies for pollination services. Pollen and nectar from flowers provide the nutritional components for colonies of honey bees to breed, but pollen is more important as it provides the colony with its source of protein. Protein content is changed by pollen lipid content which can vary from 0.8 to 18.9 %. Lipids are composed of fatty acids and a number are highly antimicrobial and play an important role in colony hygiene, whilst others are nutritionally crucial for honey bee development.

Australian honey bee colonies utilise areas of native flora where a diversity of pollen species exist or hives are placed with agricultural crops that are based on European plants grown in monocultures, e.g. canola. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in terms of breeding bees, some pollen species are much better than others and that bee health and longevity can be compromised if pollen is derived from single plant species. Protein analysis of pollen has been conducted on a wide range of species over the last two decades. However, lipid content and its analysis for fatty acids, which was reviewed for this thesis, have only been conducted on a few species. An initial investigation into the fatty acid composition of the pollen of W.A. eucalypts revealed the genus was characteristically high in linoleic acid concentration and ranged from 35.7 &#150; 48 % (2.77 &#150; 5.81 mg/g). Of the six species that are important to W.A. beekeepers, Eucalyptus wandoo (whitegum) and E. accedens (Powderbark Wandoo), a taxonomically similar species, showed similar levels of arachidic acid, whilst all three E. wandoo flowering varieties (summer, winter and spring) were the lowest in linolenic acid. Corymbia calophylla (redgum) was significantly higher in myristic and linolenic acids and E. patens (blackbutt), E. marginata (jarrah) and E. diversicolor (karri) had similar fatty acid profiles. European honey bees have evolved with plant species that have pollen that contain much higher levels of lipids, which are dominated by linolenic acid, than eucalypts. By contrast, the pollen of eucalypts, the most targeted plants by W.A. beekeepers, and other Australian plants are typically higher in linoleic than linolenic acid.

Given the influence of lipids on protein content and that fatty acid concentration varied amongst some of the important eucalypt species, a much wider study of pollen from plant species that are important to beekeepers was conducted. The first aim of the project, a national pollen survey, was undertaken in which 577 samples of pollen were collected. A total of 73 different fatty acids were identified. Of these, only five: palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic were common to all 577 samples of pollen. 

The second aim of the thesis was to investigate the effect of two commonly found fatty acids in pollen and their concentration at which longevity and life-span of honey bees, and development of the hypopharyngeal gland were deleteriously affected. An associated objective was to determine whether a range of soya bean flours, the main ingredient of an artificial bee diet that can replace pollen but differs in lipid concentration, had a similar effect. The aim encompassed two projects. In the first, two fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid) were added at concentrations from 0 to 16 % to the low-fat, bee-collected pollen from C. calophylla. Eight different lipid-enhanced diets were created and each fed to bees confined in cages (mini-colonies containing 1400 bees). Oleic and linoleic acids were chosen because they are two of the five commonly found fatty acids in pollen. Oleic acid is the dominant fatty acid in honey bees and is a monounsaturated fatty acid.  Linoleic acid is a dominant fatty acid in eucalypt pollen and is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is one of two essential fatty acids that has antimicrobial activity.

The second project revolved around the problem of maintaining bee populations when apiaries are in environments that lack floral abundance due to drought or other environmental catastrophes. In these situations, beekeepers maintain their colonies by supplying artificial feedstuffs to colonies of bees. The high-protein diet ingredient of choice is imported soya bean flour and three flours containing 0.6 % (protein concentrate), 1.8 % (defatted) and 18.9 % (full-fat) lipid, were used. Locally milled lupin flour, containing 6.9 % lipid, was tested as a possible replacement for imported soya bean flour. As for soya bean flour, lupin flour was used in pure form or mixed with pollen in diets fed to bees.  Flour and pollen combinations created another ten different diets fed to bees the same way as the fatty acid-enhanced pollen diets. 

Along with the 8 lipid-enhanced and 10 flour and flour-pollen diets, there were two sugar-only diets, one mixed from dry cane sugar and the other, a liquid invert sugar. Two redgum pollen-only diets concluded the suite of 22 diets tested. One of these pollen diets was crushed and irradiated and was several years old whilst the other was collected fresh at the beginning of experimentation and kept frozen. Crushed and irradiated pollen is in common use by Australian commercial beekeepers as feedback when conditions for floral abundance are adverse.

An early experimental result was an observation of distinctive bee behaviour after bees were confined in cages for six weeks where small but persistent numbers of bees were found hairless in samples. The behaviour was apparently the same as when single cohorts of emerged bees rearrange their caste repertoire, which has been reported elsewhere, but where no connection to head weight and caste type had been documented. Low head weight and hairlessness were strongly associated with each other. Low head weights are usually associated with foraging honey bees because the hypopharyngeal gland is no longer developed functionally.

Experimentally, bees were assessed for longevity to 22 different diets in 7 experiments. Laboratory analysis was conducted on the weekly samples of bees removed from cages where bees were measured for head weight (hypopharyngeal gland development) and nutritional status by analysing de-gutted bees for protein, lipid, mineral and fatty acid content. Of the 22 diets tested, pure redgum pollen diets gave the greatest life-span and those bees fed diets of pure sugar had the shortest life. Honey bees fed a low-fat protein concentrate from soya bean flour had the longest life of the flours tested. Adding pollen to soya bean flour diets improved longevity whereas the addition of pollen to lupin flour caused increased mortality. Defatted and full-fat soya bean flours gave similar longevities and, despite large differences in fat content, the response to diet of head weight was negligible to the diets and no response was elicited by the queen bee to lay eggs which also indicated failed gland development of the worker bees.

The addition of fatty acid (oleic and linoleic) to pollen at different concentrations caused significant differences in longevity. Overall, the addition of both fatty acids to pollen did not improve longevity. The addition of oleic acid to pollen greater than 2 % caused the longevity of bees to decrease, a poor head weight response and a failure of the queen to lay eggs. The addition of linoleic acid greater than 6 % to pollen diets had a similar response. As the percentage of oil was increased for both fatty acid additions, total consumption of the diet decreased. 

Honey bees fed soya bean, lupin flour and sugar-only diets failed to accumulate linoleic acid in their body which was in contrast to honey bees fed pollen diets. For the sugar diet, the failure of linoleic acid accumulation in bees occurred despite bees being able to accumulate total lipid. Manganese was poorly accumulated by honey bees fed both soya bean and lupin flour diets and a sugar-only diet. The implication is that linoleic acid and manganese need to be added separately to dietary formulations in a form as yet to be determined that will enable honey bees to accumulate these elements in the same way as bees do from consuming pollen.

Soya bean flour-based diets, which have been used by beekeepers for decades, or lupin flour require additional amounts of linoleic acid and manganese. Similarly, this might apply to sugar. Sugar can be fed to bees in great quantities to enable bees to successfully over-winter in cold climates or it can allow breeding to commence which subsequently stimulates the collection of pollen. Sugar-feeding is widely promoted for orchard pollination, especially for kiwifruit. These changes could make these dietary ingredients more effective in enabling bees to breed between nectar flows and be more productive or nutritionally healthier, but any changes would require further cage experimentation. Bee-collected pollen naturally high in concentrations of oleic acid should also be tested in longevity trials, in conjunction with pollen that is low in oleic acid. The three untested common fatty acids (stearic, palmitic and linolenic acid) should also be evaluated for honey bee longevity and nutritional status.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bees</field><field name="subject">Honey</field><field name="subject">Fatty Acids</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070820.125342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA methods for the detection of Phytophthora cinnamomi from soil</field><field name="creator">N.Williams@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This project assesses two aspects of DNA detection of Phytophthora species from soil samples. Firstly, a nested PCR protocol was established with both primary and nested PCR specific for P. cinnamomi detection. PCR amplification of P. cinnamomi DNA isolated from soil was optimised with the addition of bovine serum albumin and formamide. This was found to improve both the specificity and sensitivity of PCR amplification of DNA in the presence of inhibitors co-extracted along with the target DNA from soil samples. The application of diagnostic nested PCR with the addition of BSA and formamide was verified by comparison with routine culture based detection methods. In all cases, nested PCR detection incorporating BSA and formamide was found to be considerably more sensitive than the culture based detection methods. 

The second component of this thesis investigates the simultaneous detection of multiple species of Phytophthora using microarray analysis. Microarray based detection has been previously limited by variable and inconsistent hybridisation intensities across the diversity of probes used in each array. In this study a novel concept for the differentiation of detection targets using duplex melting kinetics is introduced. A microarray assay was developed on a PamChip &#132;&#165; microarray enabling the differentiation of target Phytophthora species using the melting kinetics of probe-target duplexes. In the majority of cases the hybridization kinetics of target and non-target duplexes differed significantly. Analysis of the melting kinetics of duplexes formed by probes with target and non-target DNA was found to be an effective method for determining specific hybridization and was independent of fluctuations in hybridization signal intensity. This form of analysis was more robust than the traditional approach based on hybridisation intensity, and allowed the detection of individual Phytophthora species and mixtures there of.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phytophthora cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">diagnostics soil</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070820.130155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Physiological and Behavioural Responses of Sheep Exposed to Heat Load within Intensive Sheep Industries</field><field name="creator">cstockman@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The live export and feedlotting industries are the major intensive sheep industries in Australia. During live shipment, sheep are exposed to prolonged periods of high heat and humidity, with little relief for several days, while environmental conditions in a Western Australian sheep feedlot have not yet been assessed. The research described in this thesis was conducted to determine the physiological responses of sheep to conditions within the live export and feedlotting industries, with particular focus on that of heat stress.

Merino wethers and Awassi rams developed significant change in physiological variables when exposed to prolonged periods of high heat and humidity, such as during long haul, live export voyages to the Northern Hemisphere. Physiological changes such as increased core temperature, respiratory rate, panting score and associated changes in blood gas variables were apparent in Merino wethers. However, Awassi rams showed exceptional ability to maintain homeostasis under the same environmental conditions, with no significant changes in core temperature and only slight alteration in blood gas variables. Results from this study indicated that electrolyte supplementation of sheep during live export would not be warranted because plasma electrolytes did not drastically change and blood gas variables quickly returned to normal following the heat.

Further studies developed methods to determine the critical wet bulb temperature, otherwise known as the heat stress threshold (HST) of Merino rams, ram lambs and wethers exposed to live export conditions. These studies found that ram lambs had a lower HST than both adult rams and wethers. However, both adult rams and wethers had a similar HST. Heat stress thresholds determined from these studies have been used in a model to predict high risk shipments for particular classes of sheep (Stacey 2003). 

This thesis also details the environmental conditions within a Western Australian summer feedlot and the physiological responses of cross bred ewes and wethers to these conditions when fed feedlot rations. This study found that temperatures in a typical Western Australian feedlot in summer increased above 40&#162;&#170;C with low humidity; however, temperatures generally decreased to be within the sheep&#161;&#175;s thermoneutral zone at night. Both ewes and wethers had significantly increased core temperatures in response to these conditions, with sheep spending significantly more time in the shade than in the sun during the day. Both ewes and wethers had increased respiratory rates and panting scores during an intensive climate room experiment with similar environmental conditions. However, feed intake did not decrease even when climate room temperatures increased at night and humidity levels were higher than that found in typical feedlot conditions in Western Australia. 

Work completed within this thesis has led to a greater understanding of the physiological responses of sheep to prolonged and continuous high heat such as during live export and to conditions of a typical Western Australian summer feedlot. This research has set a foundation for further study of management of sheep during live export and feedlotting.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">heat stress</field><field name="subject">feedlotting</field><field name="subject">live shipment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070820.143149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bankruptcy and Intellectual Property in the People&#146;s Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Ubbo.neelen@gmx.net</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the new system of bankruptcy law in the People&#146;s Republic of
China.

A major issue of the thesis is the analysis of the possible links and side effects of the
upcoming bankruptcy law on intellectual property rights in China.

The fact that the People&#146;s Republic of China is one of the fastest growing economies
with the intention of becoming accepted as a market economy has various influences
upon the political decisions and legal developments in China and the rest of the
world.

All changes of the legal environment in China aim at increasing the faith of foreign
investors and the growth of foreign investment in China.
China continuously allows foreigners to invest in more and more business areas and
there is a wide variety of different types of investment in China.

On the one hand, companies have the possibility to invest their capital. On the other
hand, companies have the option to invest their technical knowledge. Technical
knowledge is of particular interest to Chinese partners. Because of this strong
interest, western companies are in great danger of losing their intellectual property.

The Chinese legal system meanwhile offers western companies a range of different
corporate forms. The corporate forms &#147;Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise&#148; and &#147;joint
venture&#148; in particular are very attractive to foreign investors. Due to the large variety
of corporate forms, this thesis focuses on the involvement of foreign investors in a
joint venture.

Usually, western companies choose to invest intellectual property in the form of a
&#147;joint venture&#148;. This generates a special need for the foreign company to receive a
guarantee for their property. Foreign companies fear that a third party might use their
intellectual property and, in order to reduce this risk, they have to be very careful as
to how they invest their intellectual property in China.

The new bankruptcy law can create a new form of this well-known threat to foreign
companies who invest in the People&#146;s Republic of China. The aim of this thesis is to
identify some of these new risks and to attempt to find solutions to help foreign
investors reduce potential risks for their investments.

Globalisation and international investors are currently focusing on the Chinese
market. In order to understand the contemporary situation in China, it is important to
understand Chinese history and culture. Taking this into account, this thesis
summarises the historical and cultural aspects in the initial chapters.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Bankruptcy</field><field name="subject">Intellectual Property</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070820.144651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Fuzzy Knowledge Map Framework for Knowledge Representation</field><field name="creator">skhor@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Cognitive Maps (CMs) have shown promise as tools for modelling and simulation of knowledge in computers as representation of real objects, concepts, perceptions or events and their relations. This thesis examines the application of fuzzy theory to the expression of these relations, and investigates the development of a framework to better manage the operations of these relations.

The Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) was introduced in 1986 but little progress has been made since. This is because of the difficulty of modifying or extending its reasoning mechanism from causality to relations other than causality, such as associative and deductive reasoning. The ability to express the complex relations between objects and concepts determines the usefulness of the maps. Structuring these concepts and relations in a model so that they can be consistently represented and quickly accessed and anipulated by a computer is the goal of knowledge representation. This forms the main motivation of this research.

In this thesis, a novel framework is proposed whereby single-antecedent fuzzy rules can be applied to a directed graph, and reasoning ability is extended to include noncausality. The framework provides a hierarchical structure where a graph in a higher layer represents knowledge at a high level of abstraction, and graphs in a lower layer represent the knowledge in more detail. The framework allows a modular design of knowledge representation and facilitates the creation of a more complex structure for modelling and reasoning.

The experiments conducted in this thesis show that the proposed framework is effective and useful for deriving inferences from input data, solving certain classification problems, and for prediction and decision-making.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fuzzy knowledge map</field><field name="subject">knowledge framework</field><field name="subject">single antecedence fuzzy rule</field><field name="subject">fuzzy modelling</field><field name="subject">concept mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070822.32701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating four and five-year old children&#146;s responses to interactive television programs</field><field name="creator">ann.hynd@uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">While it is commonly believed that 'interactive' media provides benefits to young
children not obtained from 'non-interactive' media, there has been little research
examining this issue, or the kinds of interactivity that elicit these benefits. The present
study examined the attention, comprehension, and enjoyment of young children viewing
different kinds of interactive television programs compared with those of children
viewing the control prototype (non-interactive) programs. Three interactive prototypes
and one control prototype of Dora the Explorer, Hi-5, and Play School were examined
on these outcome measures. The interactive prototypes allowed participants to make
simple choices about program content using a television remote control. Four hundred
and ninety eight children aged four (49.4%) and five (50.6%) years individually viewed
one of the prototypes, and the children&#146;s attention, comprehension, and enjoyment were
examined. Participants were boys (49.7%) and girls (50.3%) drawn from Government
(64.9%), Catholic (27.6%) and Independent (7.4%) schools in Perth, Western Australia.
Significantly higher attention, comprehension, or both were found for children
interacting with two of the prototypes allowing increased viewer participation compared
to children viewing the control prototype prototypes. Interactive prototypes allowing
participants to repeat sections of program content also elicited significantly higher
comprehension than control prototypes. However, interactive prototypes allowing
participants to customise aspects of the program did not result in differences in the
outcome measures compared with control prototypes. It was also found that interactive
prototypes offering participants narrative choices were associated with significantly
lower attention, comprehension or enjoyment for either interacting or non-interacting
participants compared to the control prototypes. It is argued that interactivity, per se,
does not bestow any benefits, with only specific models of interactivity resulting in
higher comprehension or attention. In fact, some applications allowing young children to make choices about program narrative appears to disrupt program comprehension. It
is concluded that successful interactivity builds upon the features of well-designed
traditional children's television; opportunities for increased participation, and the
repetition of content.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive television</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070824.134316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical models for a population of insects infesting stored cereal products : with reference to weevils in wheat</field><field name="creator">Luboobi, Livingstone Serwadda.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves A19-A23.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Grain Storage Diseases and injuries Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Granary weevil Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Insect populations Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phl929.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6804753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrogating the World Bank&#146;s Policy on Innovative Delivery for Higher Education</field><field name="creator">Burgessmj@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Over the past thirty years, the World Bank has intensified its activities relating to
education in developing countries. Notable developments in the World Bank&#146;s policy
on education include promotion of &#147;innovative delivery&#148;, which refers to the use of new
and existing Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education. The
World Bank claims that the unique characteristics of ICTs have the potential to produce
new forms of delivery in higher education that can overcome existing barriers to
education and facilitate student-centred learning (World Bank, 1999, 2005).

Many forms of innovative delivery, such as distance education and open learning, are
not new forms of instruction. However, promotion of innovative delivery as a global
priority for education in developing countries is new. In this thesis, I interrogate the
World Bank&#146;s assumptions concerning innovative delivery as expressed in their
landmark policy statement on education, the 1999 Education Sector Strategy Report
(ES99) (World Bank, 1999). I focus on the assumptions that underlie views put forward
in the ES99 on the nature of technology and its role in education, the role of innovative
delivery in overcoming existing barriers to education, and the potential of innovative
delivery to facilitate student-centred learning. A central aim of this thesis was to better
understand the socio-cultural and pedagogical issues that may arise when these
assumptions are put into practice in different cultural contexts. This was achieved by
comparing the assumptions put forward in the ES99 with the reported perceptions of, attitudes toward, and use of ICTs by students and lecturers from three different cultural
contexts.

Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to gather detailed empirical data
on end-users&#146; perceptions, attitudes to and use of online technologies at universities in
Australia, Malaysia and the United States. The findings suggested that across all three
cultural contexts, respondents&#146; attitudes were not consistent with the World Bank&#146;s
technocratic view of innovative delivery. Moreover, the findings cast doubt on the
extent to which technology-mediated education can overcome existing barriers to
education and facilitate a student-centred approach to education. I conclude by
suggesting that the World Bank needs to adopt a more questioning stance toward the
potential effectiveness of innovative delivery. Other findings point to the contextual
nature of technology adoption and the pedagogical implications of this mode of delivery
across cultural contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Technologies</field><field name="subject">World Bank</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070824.134633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orang-utan conservation : epidemiological aspects of health management and population genetics</field><field name="creator">K.Warren@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This research addressed two important issues concerning conservation of orang-utans in
Indonesia, the prevalence of diseases in orang-utans at reintroduction centres and the
extent of intra-subspecific genetic variation between isolated populations of Bornean
orang-utans. The research was conducted at the Wanariset Orang-utan Reintroduction
Centre in East Kalirnantan fiom 1994 to 1997, during which time extensive field
excursions were made throughout Borneo, and at the Biomedical Primate Research
Centre in the Netherlands in 1998.

Analysis of clinical records fiom 1991 to 1997 showed that during this period 339
orang-utans were admitted to Wanariset, of which 96 (28.3%) died and 108 (31.8%)
were released. Studies were designed to identify and determine the prevalence of
diseases, specifically gastro-intestinal parasites, tuberculosis and certain viral diseases.
Further studies defined the factors associated with mortalities of orang-utans at the
reintroduction centre.

Gastro-intestinal parasites, in particular Strongyloides spp. and Balantidium coli, posed
health problems for rehabilitant orang-utans. Strongyloides spp. and Strongyle sp. eggs
and B. coli were detected in faecal samples from new arrivals, rehabilitant, released and
wild individuals. Trichuris trichura was present in new arrivals, released and rehabilitant
orang-utans, whereas Ascaris sp., and Cyclospora sp. were present only in rehabilitants.
There was a high prevalence of B. coli in new arrivals (41.6%), rehabilitants (100%) and
released individuals (100%) and a low prevalence in wild individuals (12.5%). Faecal egg counts of individuals infected with Strongyloides spp. showed that 47.8% of
rehabilitants and 14.3% of new arrivals had egg counts over 1000 eggs/gm, 81.8% of
released individuals had egg counts less than 500 eggslgm and all wild individuals had egg
counts less than 100 eggs/mg. Strongyloidosis was the primary cause of death (21.9%)
of rehabilitant orang-utans, prior to the incorporation of oral ivermectin into the parasite
control program.

There was a low prevalence of tuberculosis, which was detected in one individual
(0.8%) and suspected to have caused the death of two others (2.1% of deaths).
Diagnosis of tuberculosis in orang-utans was complicated by inaccuracies and
difficulties in interpreting the diagnostic tests commonly used in humans and nonhuman
primates. Further research is required to develop more reliable and accurate tests
for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in orang-utans.

A study of the serological prevalence of a number of viral infections in captive orangutans
showed evidence of exposure to hepatitis B virus (42.6%), hepatitis A virus
(34.9%), herpes simplex viruses (14.7%), simian D-type retroviruses (11.2%) and
human T-lymphotrogic viruses (1.4%). There was no evidence of exposure to simian or
human immunodeficiency viruses.

Molecular studies to determine the origin of the hepatitis B virus, showed the virus was
not of human origin as has been generally assumed, but was an indigenous virus which
also occurred naturally in wild populations. The virus was subsequently named Orangutan
Hepadnavirus.

A molecular study using mitochondrial DNA was undertaken to determine whether
there was significant genetic diversity between six isolated populations of wild orangutans
within Borneo. It was concluded that there are at least four genetically distinct
populations located in East Kalimantan, southwest Kalirnantdcentral Kalirnantan,
northwest KalimantdSarawak, and Sabah.

The findings of this research are discussed in terms of the implications for management
policies for reintroduction centres, as well as for the conservation of wild populations.
They will also be of relevance to zoos and primate centres.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orangutan</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Wildlife Conservation</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070824.94929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic variation of two localised populations of Phytophthora cinnamomi from Western Australia and how they impact on Eucalyptus marginata resistance</field><field name="creator">D.Huberli@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Phytophthora cinnamomi is an introduced soilborne phytopathogen to Western Australia (WA) and impacts on 2000 of the approximately 9000 plant species indigenous in the southwest of WA. Amongst these is Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), the dominant and economically important hardwood timber species of the jarrah forest. This thesis aimed to investigate the morphological, pathogenic and genotypic variation in two local WA populations of P. cinnamomi isolates. The populations were selected from areas where jarrah clonal lines selected for resistance to P. cinnamomi may be used in the rehabilitation of infested jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites in the southwest of WA. Resistance against a range of isolates using different inoculation methods.

Seventy-three isolates of P. cinnamomi were collected from diseased jarrah and Corymbia calophylla (marri) trees from two populations located 70 km apart and these were examined for phenotypic and genotypic variation. Microsatellite DNA analysis showed that all isolates were of the same clonal lineage. In P. cinnamomi for the first time I show that there is a broad and continuous variation in the morphology and pathology between two populations of one clonal lineage, and that all phenotypes varied independently from one another. No relationship was found between morphological and pathogenic characters. The ability of isolates in both populations to cause deaths ranged from killing all plants within 59 days to plants being symptomless 182 days after inoculation.

Single and multiple paragynous antheridia formed along with amphigynous ones in mating studies with all WA isolates and a sample of worldwide isolates. Developmental studies and cytological examination showed fertilisation tubes developed asynchronously or synchronously from both antheridial types and indicated that either antheridial type contributed a nucleus for fertilisation of the oosphere. This is the first report of paragynous antheridial associations in P. cinnamomi. Antheridial variation is a characteristic that needs to be adjusted in the taxonomic Phytophthora identification keys.

In underbark and zoospore stem inoculations of three 1.5-year-old jarrah clonal lines (two ranked as resistant (RR) and one as susceptible (SS) to P. cinnamomi in the original selection trials) at 15, 20, 25 and 30&#176;C, it was found that the method of inoculation did not produce comparable results, particularly at 25 and 30&#176;C. At these temperatures, all three clonal lines had 100% mortality when inoculated underbark, but when inoculated with zoospores, one RR line had 60% survival and the SS and remaining RR line had 100% mortality. Generally, the level of resistance of all clonal lines declined with increasing temperature. Lesion development was measured at 20, 25 and 30&#176;C for 4 days in detached branches of an RR and SS clonal line inoculated underbark with four different P. cinnamomi isolates. Detached branches were found to be a potential screen for jarrah resistance to P. cinnamomi and to allow the identification of susceptible and resistant clonal lines at 30&#176;C.

Lesion and colonisation development of P. cinnamomi isolates were assessed in situ (late autumn) of seed-grown and clonal lines of 3.5 to 4.5 year-old jarrah trees growing in a rehabilitated minesite jarrah forest in underbark inoculation of lateral branches (1995) or simultaneously in lateral branches and lateral roots (1996). Trees were underbark inoculated in lateral branches and lateral roots. Colonisation was more consistent as a measure of resistance than lesion length over the two trials because it accounted for the recovery of P. cinnamomi from macroscopically symptomless tissue beyond lesions, which on some occasions, was up to 6 cm. In the two trials, one RR clonal line consistently had small lesion and colonisation lengths in branches and roots. In contrast, the remaining two RR clonal lines had similar lesion and colonisation lengths to the SS clonal line and may, therefore, not be suitable for use in the rehabilitation of P. cinnamomi infested areas. The relative rankings of the jarrah clonal lines by colonisation lengths were similar between branch and root inoculations. Branch inoculations are a valid option for testing resistance and susceptibility of young jarrah trees to P. cinnamomi.

The pathogen was recovered on Phytophthora selective agar 3&#150;6 months after inoculation from 50% of samples with lesions and 30% of symptomless samples in a series of growth cabinet, glasshouse and field experiments. However, up to 11% of samples with and without lesions and from which P. cinnamomi was not initially isolated contained viable pathogen after leaching the plant material in water over 9 days. This indicates that the pathogen could be present as dormant structures, such as chlamydospores, where dormancy needs to be broken for germination to occur, or fungistatic compounds in the tissue need to be removed to allow the pathogen to grow, or both. These results have important implications for disease diagnosis and management, disease-free certification and quarantine clearance.

No clonal line of jarrah was found to be 100% resistant using different inoculation methods, environmental conditions and when challenged by individuals from a large range of P. cinnamomi isolates. Even the most promising RR line had individual replicates that were unable to contain lesions or died with time. This suggests that further screening work may be required using more isolates varying in their capacity to cause disease and a broader range of environmental conditions. Jarrah clonal lines that survive such rigorous screening could then be expected to survive planting out in a range of environments in the jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora</field><field name="subject">Cinnamomi</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Jarrah</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070827.91902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plants and the environment</field><field name="creator">A.Mccomb@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">No abstract available</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plants Bibliography</field><field name="subject">Plant Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070828.135211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immigrating to and ageing in Australia : Chinese experiences</field><field name="creator">xiumei@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Chinese communities, large or small, exist in almost every country in the world. The huge Chinese diaspora has played a big role in the global economy. Those in Australia are no exception. The first significant Chinese immigration to Australia came in the 1850s during the gold rush era. Since then Chinese immigration to Australia has gone through up and down periods. However, only after the diplomatic relationship between Australia and China was established in 1972, did mainland Chinese begin to come to Australia directly from China. Since 1978 when China opened its door to the world and started its economic reform, more and more Chinese students have come to Australia. In particular, after the Tiananmen Square Incident in 1989, a significant number of Chinese became Australian permanent residents and contributed to the fast growth of the established Chinese community in Australia.

This thesis analyses immigration and ageing issues relating to the Australian Chinese community, which is now not only one of the oldest in Australia, but also one of the biggest, and economically, one of the most dynamic communities. It draws a historical and contemporary picture of overseas Chinese in Australia, including the Chinese migrants who remained in this country after the Tiananmen Square Incident. This study developed a model to investigate a wide range of factors that drive population movement between Australia and China. The determining factors include a wide range of push and pull forces that change constantly with the overall political, economic and environmental developments. The research findings claim that the pull, push and enabling factors interact with each other to influence Chinese people&#146;s decision to migrate from China to Australia. It becomes apparent that there are certain determinants which can help explain, understand and project this complex process in the future.

This study further proves that Chinese migrants in Australia have made the smooth, but challenging transition between their native and adopted countries. Being involved into the Australian mainstream society, Chinese Australians have achieved economic adaptation and enjoy living in their new country. In addition, Chinese citizens who are studying as international students in Australia are potential skilled migrants and they are likely to apply for migration status after completing their studies. It is believed that Australia continues to be one of the most desired Western migration destinations for Chinese nationals and the magnitude of the Chinese ethnic community in Australia will continue to grow. In the future, the number of elderly Chinese in Australia is likely to increase as the majority of current economically active Chinese intend to retire in Australia and more older Chinese are expected to migrate to Australia for family reunion. As part of the general issues of Australian ageing population, this study attempts to raise the awareness of the challenging life-style of the Chinese elderly in Australia now and future.

This study offers convincing evidence that Chinese immigrants play a vital bridging role in promoting business and trade between Australia and China. Due to China&#146;s economic growth, their movement between these two countries will be more frequent. Overall, this study provides important considerations for policy makers and will benefit the broad communities, migrants and policy planners in understanding the model of Chinese immigration into Australia. The insights gained from this study should have important policy implications for a more sustainable way of living not only in Australia, but also in China and other countries with Chinese immigrants.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese Australia</field><field name="subject">Emigration Immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070828.91039</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientific literacy for sustainability</field><field name="creator">k.murcia@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">We only need to consider public media reports to appreciate that there is growing
concern amongst citizens for sustainability. This concern arises from increasing
appreciation that the current direction and rate of exploitation of resources is not
sustainable and humanity&#146;s actions today are arguably compromising future generations&#146;
ability to meet their living needs. By drawing on the research of scientists, ranging from
their evidence of the problems of sustainability to those promising solutions, the same
press reports show strong links between sustainability and science. The appearance of
such reports in the public media implies that citizens understand the interaction of
science and sustainability and that they can engage critically with scientific research,
including its applications and implications for sustainability. In this dissertation this
understanding and capacity to engage critically is termed scientific literacy. The general
question governing the research reported in this dissertation arose from this context and
is: What does it mean for citizens to be scientifically literate within the context of
sustainability? More specifically, because it is expected that university graduates are
well educated in a socially relevant manner, with commensurate responsibilities and
influence, the focus question studied in this dissertation is: What does it mean for
university graduates to be scientifically literate?

It became apparent from the review of the literature, that the concept of scientific
literacy was multidimensional. The three key dimensions that emerged were (i) the
fundamental and enduring ideas and concepts of science, (ii) the nature of science and
(iii) the interaction of science with society. These dimensions provided the framework
for the research reported in this dissertation. Within this framework and based on the
literature, two relationships amongst these dimensions were proposed. The first relationship was that the dimensions were in a conceptual hierarchal order, with
successive dimensions including the previous dimensions and expanding upon them.
The second relationship was that students&#146; scientific literacy developed sequentially
along the same hierarchy. It was proposed that development occurred sequentially, with
development of concepts of science first, nature of science second and interaction with
society last. It was proposed that a scientifically literate person would have reached the
level of understanding that includes the interaction of science with society. Specific
indicators of the successive dimensions were functional, conceptual/procedural and
multidimensional, which at this highest level, includes the relationship between the first
two dimensions and society.

This framework and the associated indicators were used as a structure and lens for
interrogating the development of scientific literacy of 244 first year university students
enrolled in Australia&#146;s Murdoch University&#146;s foundation unit, Life and the Universe.
This is one of five units from which first year students are required to select one. The
units are interdisciplinary in nature with Life and the Universe being a unit that covers
generic issues in science. In part because of its content and in part because it allows
students from all backgrounds to enrol, it was considered suitable for studying,
illustratively, the development of scientific literacy of potential university graduates.
The development of scientific literacy was studied in three ways. First, participants
responded to open questions about a newspaper report of science, before and after their
studying in Life and the Universe, second, they responded to a Likert style questionnaire
regarding the nature of science, again before and after studying the unit, and third, a
subset of participants were involved in a focus group run over two years.

The participants&#146; responses to the open questions on the questionnaire were analysed for
their critical engagement with the news brief, in terms of their ability to give reasons
why the text should be accepted or rejected. The nature of requests for extra information
about the news brief&#146;s content was also analysed. Analysis of the initial responses to the
open questions showed that more than fifty percent of the participants in this study did
not demonstrate the ability to critically engage with science reported in the news.

The Likert style questionnaire assessed participants&#146; conception of the nature of science,
with one end of the continuum reflecting a traditional view that science was a body of
unchanging facts, derived from objective and value free observations, and the other
reflecting a more contemporary view, that scientific knowledge was dynamic, open to
change, had subjective components, and had scientists socially located so that their work
was not free of values. Analysis of the initial responses to the Nature of Science
questionnaire showed that more than fifty percent of the participants were located on the
continuum towards the contemporary, socially located end. However, it also showed that
the majority were still not sufficiently located towards the contemporary end of the
continuum to view science as dynamic, with a changing body of knowledge. There was
no statistically significant difference in these analyses in relation to participants&#146; gender,
time out of school, course of enrolment or science background.

Unexpectedly, the comparison in the analysis of the news brief pre and post Life and the
Universe showed that the number of participants engaging critically did not increase.
More expectedly, the comparison of the pre and post Life and the Universe responses to
the Likert scale showed that there was overall a statistically significant increase in the
group&#146;s contemporary, socially located, perspective of the nature of science during their
participation in the foundation unit. Specifically, the participants demonstrated raised awareness of the tentative and subjective nature of science and that scientists study a
world in which they are a part and, as such, their work is not objective or value free.
Nevertheless, there was substantial possibility of higher locations on the scale which the
majority of participants did not reach. This statistically significant increase, but
possibility for further improvement, is compatible with the lack of increase in critical
engagement with the news brief and suggests that the statistical increase was not
educationally significant.

The focus group data contributed greater depth of understanding to the researcher about
the range in participants&#146; conceptions of the nature of science. The conceptions evident
were consistent with the conclusions from the open questions and Likert style
questionnaire and also highlighted limited understandings of scientific processes or
scientific methods. It was evident that misconceptions and na&#239;ve understandings of the
contemporary nature of science were present at the beginning and retained throughout
the foundation unit learning experience. These limitations helped explain participants&#146;
inability to engage meaningfully and to question critically the science news briefs
contained in the questionnaires. Data from the focus group also suggested that a limited
understanding of science terms prevented critical engagement with the content of the
news briefs.

Following closely the focus group participants&#146; development of scientific literacy over a
two year period, allowed the researcher to gain a greater depth of understanding of the
participants&#146; development of scientific literacy than that which could be gained alone
from the large scale administrations of the questionnaire. This experience highlighted
that the development of scientific literacy was far more complex than the originally
proposed sequential development across the three dimensions. The analysis of converging sources of data challenged this proposition and resulted in a reconstruction
of understanding about the development of scientific literacy. It was evident that the
ability and disposition to critically question and act scientifically required parallel
development of science content, socially located conceptions of the nature of science
and understanding of its interaction with society. It was the blended and parallel
development of these knowledge dimensions, at any level, that demonstrated scientific
literacy.

In order to characterise the more complex structure amongst the dimensions in which
parallel development occurred, a rope metaphor was used. This metaphor effectively
represented the observed development of scientific literacy, as it made concrete the
interwoven threads of multidimensional knowledge. It represented more realistically
the complex, intertwining and multidimensional aspects of participants&#146; development of
scientific literacy. Re-thinking the development of scientific literacy and representing
the construct with the rope metaphor offered possibilities for effective pedagogy in
higher education. The interaction of multidimensional threads of knowledge seems an
integral part of the development of scientific literacy and suggests the need for teaching
and learning experiences that are holistic in nature and driven by socially relevant
contexts.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science Language</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070828.93112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation, Recombinant Expression and Immunogenicity of BHLP29.7, An Outer Membrane Lipoprotein of Brachyspira Hyodysenteriae</field><field name="creator">T.La@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Swine dysentery (SD) is an important endemic infection in many piggeries, and control can be problematic. In this study, the gene encoding a 29.7 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein of the causative intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, was identified and sequenced. An 816 bp hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) was identified, with a potential ribosome binding site, and putative &#150;10 and &#150;35 promoter regions upstream from the start of the ORF. The 29.7 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein was designated Bhlp29.7 and the encoding gene named bhlp29.7.

The amino acid sequence of Bhlp29.7 included a 19 residue hydrophobic signal peptide, incorporating a potential signal peptidase cleavage site and membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site. In silico analysis of this protein together with lipidation studies further supported its probable outer membrane localisation. Comparison of the Bhlp29.7 sequence with public sequence databases showed that it had up to 40% similarity with the D-methionine substrate-binding outer membrane lipoprotein (MetQ) of a number of bacterial pathogens. The Bhlp29.7 gene was detected in all 48 strains of B. hyodysenteriae examined, and in Brachyspira innocens strain B256T, but not in 10 other strains of B. innocens or in 42 strains of other Brachyspira spp. The gene was sequenced from B. innocens strain B256T and from 11 strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The B. hyodysenteriae genes shared 97.9-100% nucleotide sequence identity and had 97.5-99.5% identity with the gene of B. innocens strain B256T. The Bhlp29.7 gene was subsequently cloned and expressed as a histidine fusion protein in an Escherichia coli expression system.

An ELISA test using recombinant his-tagged Bhlp29.7 (His6-Bhlp29.7) as the detecting antigen was developed and evaluated. The threshold value of the test was chosen to provide a highly stringent assessment of the disease status of a herd. The sensitivity and specificity of the test was 100%. When the test was applied to sera from eight herds with suspected SD, four gave ELISA values indicating that the herds were diseased. The remaining four herds gave ELISA values below the threshold value. These results indicated that the Bhlp29.7-ELISA was useful as an indirect test for exposure of a herd to B. hyodysenteriae and may be a helpful complement to current methods of SD diagnosis.

Recombinant His6-Bhlp29.7 was evaluated as a vaccine subunit for prevention of SD. The His6-Bhlp29.7 was shown to be immunogenic in mice following two intramuscular injections. Vaccination of mice with His6-Bhlp29.7 provided full protection after oral challenge with B. hyodysenteriae. In two experiments, intramuscular and oral vaccination of pigs with the His6-Bhlp29.7 resulted in a 50% reduction in incidence of SD compared to unvaccinated control pigs (P=0.047). This is the first subunit vaccine shown to provide pigs with protection from SD. Further work is needed to optimise delivery routes and adjuvants for commercial development of the vaccine.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lipoprotein</field><field name="subject">outer mebrane protein</field><field name="subject">swine dysentery</field><field name="subject">vaccine</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070830.141953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-industrial personal benzene exposure in a mediterranean climate</field><field name="creator">Anthonyhorton@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Benzene is a volatile organic air pollutant that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is frequently reported in urban airsheds, principally as a result of evaporative emissions from motor vehicles. Increasingly stringent fuel quality standards have resulted in lower mean benzene concentrations in many urban airsheds, however the concentrations reported indoors can be higher than those in urban airsheds. Mean indoor benzene concentrations can reach one order of magnitude higher than those reported in urban airsheds. Long term exposure to very high benzene concentrations can result in leukemia, however the health risks of long term non-industrial exposure in the general public are currently uncertain.

An important part of determining the risks of non-industrial benzene exposure is to first determine the influence of various activities on 24-hour personal benzene exposure. Previous research has identified commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel as statistically significant contributors to nonindustrial benzene exposure in the Northern Hemisphere, however none has quantified the increase in benzene exposure as a result of these activities over a 24-hour period in the Mediterranean climate. The results of the 1987 TEAM study in the South Bay section of California reported that automobile exhaust was a significant contributor to non-industrial benzene exposure based on exhaled breath concentrations (p&lt;0.05) and commuting in a private vehicle (p=0.0003) and refuelling (0.05) were important contributors based on personal benzene exposure concentrations (Wallace et al., 1988).

The aims of this thesis were to identify the roles and importance of selected activities in personal exposure to benzene, to determine the increase in 24-hour personal benzene exposure attributable to these activities and quantify the risk posed by these activities in a Mediterranean climate. In particular, the aim of this thesis was to investigate whether commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling are significant contributors to non-industrial personal benzene exposure in a Mediterranean climate, or whether lifestyle and climate interact.

This research was composed of a personal exposure study, a source monitoring study and a risk assessment. A cross-sectional personal exposure study was conducted for two reasons. Firstly, to quantify the mean personal benzene concentrations to which a representative sample of the general public of Perth was exposed as a result of their daily activities and behaviours. Secondly, to quantify the frequency of commuting by private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel in Perth. Fifty participants were recruited for the personal exposure study, and asked to wear a monitor for 24-hour period(including weekends) in summer and winter and record their activities and locations in a diary. Prior to the monitoring they were asked to complete a questionnaire seeking background information on their home, lifestyle and behaviours. The results of the research revealed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the personal benzene exposure concentrations in summer and winter. An analysis of the questionnaire and time activity diary data using a generalised linear mixed model revealed that the time spent commuting in a private motor vehicle (&#226;= 0.281, p&lt;0.0001) and refuelling with low benzene fuel (&#226; = 0.194, p=0.033) were statistically significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure. Each hour spent commuting resulted in a mean increase in 24-hour personal exposure of 0.74 &#236;gm-3 (&#226;= 0.729 &#236;g m-3, p&lt; 0.0001). The mean increase in exposure per hour of commuting in a private motor vehicle was larger in winter (&#226;= 0.8 &#236;g m-3, p=0.008) than summer (&#226;= 0.67 &#236;g m-3, p=0.004). Refuelling increased personal exposure by 1.50 &#236;g m-3 (1.49, p&lt;0.0001) in each 24-period when refuelling was reported.

Benzene source monitoring was conducted at selected locations in Perth for two reasons. Firstly, data quantifying non-industrial personal benzene exposure during refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle in Perth was needed, and secondly, to make an assessment of risk attributable to these activities.

Benzene source measurements were conducted in two carparks in the Central Business District (CBD), in the vicinity of the northbound and southbound lanes of the Kwinana Freeway, and at a petrol station. The 7- day arithmetic mean benzene concentrations in the carparks were 4.49 &#236;g m-3 and 1.23 &#236;g m-3. The 7-day mean benzene concentrations northbound on the Kwinana Freeway was 2.78 &#236;g m-3, and the mean benzene concentration southbound was 2.57 &#236;g m-3. Benzene emissions in the carpark and on the Kwinana Freeway were measured during vehicle idling, which is representative of vehicle speed during heavy vehicle traffic. Benzene emissions at the petrol station were monitored in the vicinity of the petrol bowser, which is representative of emissions during refuelling. The 24-hour mean benzene concentration at the petrol station bowser was 38.15 &#236;g m-3.

The results of this research revealed that refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle are the most significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure in Perth, and that the contribution of these two activities in Perth is far greater than in previous published research, on the basis of the results obtained from the generalised linear model. The results of this research quantified the increase in non-industrial benzene exposure from refuelling and commuting in a private motor vehicle in a Mediterranean climate for the first time, and quantified the lifetime excess cancer risk attributable to these activities in a Mediterranean climate for the first time. The lifetime excess cancer unit risks of these two activities in a Mediterranean climate were 7.4x10-5 or 7.4 per 100000 population for commuting and 15.03 x 10-4 or 15 per 10000 for refuelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal exposure</field><field name="subject">benzene</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070830.143310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using the submergent Triglochin huegelii for domestic greywater treatment</field><field name="creator">Ross Mars</field><field name="description">In recent years, there has been increased interest in alternative and
innovative technologies which are used in the treatment of wastewaters, with
the aim of developing efficient systems which are low-cost and lowmaintenance.
However, greywater reuse from domestic houses appears to
have received very little attention and the role of indigenous wetland plants,
especially submergents, in contributing to nutrient reduction in wastewater
is largely unknown.

Species of Triglochin, commonly known as water ribbons, are fast growing
submergent macrophytes. In Western Australia, Triglochin huegelii is
mainly a submergent plant but as water recedes, the leaves become
emergent. Triglochin huegelii can tolerate a range of water regimes and high
nutrient concentrations, and this is useful in wastewater treatment
applications. The aims of this present study were to examine the use of
Triglochin huegelii for domestic greywater treatment, to compare the
effectiveness of this plant with other better known, and more frequently used,
emergent macrophytes, and to investigate why Triglochin huegelii is so
successful in nutrient accumulation.

A series of investigations using Triglochin huegelii in greywater treatment
experiments showed that Triglochin has consistently removed more nitrogen
and phosphorus, in all parts of the plant - leaves, tubers and roots, than most
other indigenous emergent macrophyte species, including those of
Schoenoplectus, Baumea and Juncus which are commonly used for wastewater nutrient-stripping. In some cases, such as in the leaves, twice as
much nitrogen (N) and one and a half times more phosphorus (P) is
assimilated in the Triglochin tissue. In all parts of the plant there has been
an increase in Total N and Total P.

Investigations were conducted using different environmental conditions for
the plants. A comparison was made between root zone (substrate-only) and
complete pond conditions, with some changes to loading rate and retention
times. Triglochin huegelii has many practical applications in wastewater
management, especially if the level of influentlwastewater can be controlled,
thus allowing sufficient time for Triglochin huegelii to respond with changed
structure and morphology. Proline, a substance known to be produced by
plants under stress (such as changing water levels), was detected in
Triglochin huegelii.

In a pond, the leaves of Triglochin can be directly involved in nutrient
absorption and assimilation. A study of leaf structure and other aspects of its
biology showed that nutrients can easily pass into leaf tissue and then into
other regions in the plant. In Triglochin huegelii, nitrogen was primarily
stored or found in leaves then tubers then roots, while levels of phosphorus
were higher in tubers then roots then leaves.

The above-ground:below-ground (AG:BG) ratio of Triglochin huegelii also
depends on the water regime. For all samples, whether pond or substrateonly,
the ratio was 0.84. However, when consideration is given to pond
conditions the ratio increases to 1.11. It appears that in pond conditions, and especially with long retention times, proportionally more above-ground
growth (leaves) occurs and in substrate-only conditions, proportionally more
biomass is found below-ground, with the number and size of leaves reduced
in these plants.

The highest nutrient levels recorded for Triglochin huegelii were 11.74 mgP/g
and 35.7 mgN/g dry weight. Triglochin huegelii has been found to have a
protein content of at least 1.7 g/100 g wet weight in the leaves, and less in roots
and tubers. Triglochin huegelii could have potential as a fodder source
because of its high protein content, similar to that of lucerne.

Triglochin huegelii seems to remove nitrogen and phosphorus at a greater
rate than many other types of aquatic macrophytes. Other parameters such
as BOD, Suspended Solids and fecal coliforms were also examined, with
reductions of up to 90%, 84% and 99% respectively. The implication is that
instead of only planting the perimeter of lagoons, artificial wetlands and
constructed basins we should be planting the bulk of the waterway with
submergent species such as Triglochin spp which are far more effective in
stripping nutrients than emergents currently used for that purpose. In
addition, systems need to be designed that mimic natural ecosystems, and yet
are economical and functional.

This current research can be used as a basis for further study to establish the
extent of nutrient removal by Triglochin huegelii and its interactions with
other macrophytes in polyculture systems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sewage irrigation</field><field name="subject">Triglochin</field><field name="subject">huegelii</field><field name="subject">Water Reuse</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070830.144808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Emperor's New Clothes': The Role of the Western Australian Press and State Government in Selling the Story of the Northbridge Curfew</field><field name="creator">karinmac@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The Northbridge curfew is one of the stand-out success stories of Western Australia&#146;s Labor Government.  Introduced in June 2003 in an alleged bid to make the streets safer, the Northbridge curfew has enjoyed overwhelming popular support and consistently high recognition in public opinion polls.  This is despite the fact that the curfew bypasses those known to be responsible for most of the crime in the precinct (white males aged 18 to 35 years), targeting instead young people aged under 18 and affecting indigenous girls in particular.  The curfew did not introduce any legislative changes (the police already had the powers under the Child Welfare Act 1947 to apprehend young people); neither did it allocate any additional resources to the organisations working with young people in Northbridge.  Yet the coverage of the curfew in the WA press implied that indigenous youth presented a serious problem in Perth&#146;s premier entertainment district and that the State Government was doing something about it.

This thesis uses a framing analysis of the press coverage of the Northbridge curfew as well as interviews with the relevant journalists and government media advisers to demonstrate how news values, work routines and political imperatives encouraged the WA press and State Government to work together in creating a 'fable' about Northbridge that criminalised indigenous youth.  I argue that the story of the Northbridge curfew, like the 'Emperor's new clothes&#146;, presents a deliberate distortion of reality and that the various stages of its development illuminate the processes by which media and government can collaborate to manipulate public opinion.

I draw on my research findings to present recommendations designed, first, to encourage media professionals to develop a range of sources beyond government and, second, to draw the attention of the State Government to the broader ramifications of the Northbridge curfew story for all members of the Western Australian community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">spin</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070830.213559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Naming youth : the construction of the youth category</field><field name="creator">Howard Sercombe</field><field name="description">The youth category, in its modern form, has emerged under particular social and economic
conditions, under the influence of particular social institutions, shaped by particular discourses.
This thesis is an inquiry into the constitution of youth as a social category through an examination
of these factors.

Through a review of the historical and sociological literature, the thesis establishes the conditions
for the emergence of the modem concept of youth in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
The evidence suggests that the youth category came into being as a result of changes in the
industrial family, the industrial reforms which progressively excluded children and young people
fkom the workforce, and the establishment of compulsory schooling - especially secondary
schooling. Parallel with these developments, a variety of discourses about youth (or
"adolescence") were generated, establishing the emergent category in scientific terms. G. Stanley
Hall's theories of adolescence, developed around the turn of the century, were perhaps the most
influential of these, casting adolescence as a universal stage in life characterised by social and
psychological turmoil. In sociology, this theoretical frame has been the subject of longstanding
debate. The thesis explores this debate, and attempts to establish a sociological view of the youth
, category in the light of the historical and sociological evidence. In these explorations, "youth" is
established as a product of historical processes, a product of political economy and of scientific
discourse.

The analysis is brought into the present through a study of how youth are represented in a highcirculation
daily newspaper, The West Australian. Using standard media analysis techniques, the
study examines the construction of language around youth, and the kinds of stories in which they
appear in the newspaper, and finds a detailed discursive apparatus through which young people are
classified as good or bad, passive (victim, child) or active (perpetrator, adult). These
constructions vary with the institutional location of the news source, and with such factors as the
gender and ethnicity of the subject, while continuing to be underwritten by orthodox discourses of
adolescence. For its part, the newspaper overwhelmingly casts youth in a law and order frame,
driven by the appetites of audiences and the economies of news production.

The study explores the differences as well as the continuities in the concept of youth employed in
the patchwork of discourse that constitutes newspaper text. In these explorations, "youth" is
established in the present as a contested category, the subject of competing discourses. Competing
institutions and professions, in their interventions in the newspaper, try to secure a reading of the
youth phenomenon which is consistent with their professional and political objectives.

The thesis is about the constitution of youth. Through the analysis of historical and contemporary
discourse about youth, the thesis reveals how the subjection of this section of the adult population
is achieved and maintained, how they are established as a pliable, coercible and economically
dispensable population, and how the instruments of their governance are legitimated.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth</field><field name="subject">Mass Media</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.115336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent content-based image retrieval framework based on semi-automated learning and historic profiles</field><field name="creator">chungkp@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Over the last decade, storage of non text-based data in databases has become an increasingly important trend in information management. Image in particular, has been gaining popularity as an alternative, and sometimes more viable, option for information storage. While this presents a wealth of information, it also creates a great problem in retrieving appropriate and relevant information during searching. This has resulted in an enormous growth of interest, and much active research, into the extraction of relevant information from non text-based databases. In particular,content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems have been one of the most active areas of research. 

The retrieval principle of CBIR systems is based on visual features such as colour, texture, and shape or the semantic meaning of the images. To enhance the retrieval speed, most CBIR systems pre-process the images stored in the database. This is because feature extraction algorithms are often computationally expensive. If images are to be retrieved from the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the raw images have to be downloaded and processed in real time. In this case, the feature extraction speed becomes crucial. Ideally, systems should only use those feature extraction algorithms that are most suited for analysing the visual features that capture the common relationship between the images in hand. In this thesis, a statistical discriminant analysis based feature selection framework is proposed. Such a framework is able to select the most appropriate visual feature  extraction algorithms by using relevance feedback only on the user labelled samples. The idea is that a smaller image sample group is used to analyse the appropriateness of each visual feature, and only the selected features will be used for image comparison and ranking. As the number of features is less, an improvement in the speed of retrieval is achieved. From experimental results, it is found that the retrieval accuracy for small sample data has also improved. Intelligent E-Business has been used as a case study in this thesis to demonstrate the potential of the framework in the application of image retrieval system. 

In addition, an inter-query framework has been proposed in this thesis. This framework is also based on the statistical discriminant analysis technique. A common approach in inter-query for a CBIR system is to apply the term-document approach. This is done by treating each image&#146;s name or address as a term, and the query session as a document. However, scalability becomes an issue with this technique as the number of stored queries increases. Moreover, this approach is not appropriate for a dynamic image database environment. In this thesis, the proposed inter-query framework uses a cluster approach to capture the visual properties common to the previously stored queries. Thus, it is not necessary to &#147;memorise&#148; the name or address of the images. In order to manage the size of the user&#146;s profile, the proposed framework also introduces a merging approach to combine clusters that are close-by and similar in their characteristics. Experiments have shown that the proposed framework has outperformed the short term learning approach. It also has the advantage that it eliminates the burden of the complex database maintenance strategies required in the term-document approach commonly needed by the interquery learning framework. Lastly, the proposed inter-query learning framework has been further extended by the incorporation of a new semantic structure. The semantic structure is used to connect the previous queries both visually and semantically. This structure provides the system with the ability to retrieve images that are semantically similar and yet visually different. To do this, an active learning strategy has been incorporated for exploring the structure. Experiments have again shown that the proposed new framework has outperformed the previous framework.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Content based image retrieval system</field><field name="subject">relevance feedback</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.123947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voluntary environmental and social accounting disclosure practices in the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Shaun Leigh Mitchell Williams</field><field name="description">Through the juxtaposition of political economy theory and an in-depth
empirical analysis, this study provides hrther insights into the understanding
of variables that explain variations in voluntary environmental and social
accounting disclosures (VESAD) across national and regional boundaries.
Factors from three classes of Thomas (1991) classification schema, the
organizational attribute (organizational size and economic performance),
business environment (industry type) and societal variable (culture, political
and civil, system, legal system, level of economic development and equity
market) categories, were included in this project.

Listed companies' annual reports were surveyed using content analysis and
disclosure index from seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia,
Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
The dependent variable, the extent of VESAD information, was measured by
four different measurement bases; these were number pages, sentences and
words and disclosure index score. Different measurement bases were used to
compare and contrast findings from statistical tests to examine if this lead to
conflicting or comparable conclusions.

Descriptive and univariate analysis indicated that under all four measurement
bases the country of origin was an important determinant of VESAD practices
in the Asia-Pacific region. Multiple regression and path analysis showed that
organizational size, industry type, culture, political and civil, and legal systems
were statistically significant in explaining variations both directly and
indirectly. The level of economic development was also found to be of
important but only indirectly. It is concluded from these findings that social
and political pressures placed on companies by the interaction of these
significant variables compel firms to provide VESAD information to meet
social expectations and to avoid possible government regulation to preserve
their own self interests and survival. Economic performance and equity market
factors were of no significant statistical influence.

Empirical results using data measured by the three units of measurement for
content analysis were minimal. Differences were . noted however when
contrasted against disclosure index scores. It was concluded from these results
that content analysis and disclosure indices measured different concepts, the
latter measuring largely a subset of the former. The consequence of this
finding, is that researchers, when deciding on whether to measure the
dependent variable by content analysis or a disclosure index, will need to
define more the relevance of the measurement to be adopted to the research

of the self to critically examine the deployment of post-structuralist, psychoanalytic,
sociological and cultural studies' paradigms for theorising and researching masculinities.
It is argued that a particular dialectical mode of rationality and a project of cultural
completion inform these approaches which are based on a requirement to reconcile
oppositional categories such as freedom and determination, subject-determining state and
self-determining subject, social structure and social actor. The limits are outlined of
theorising subjectivity in terms of the restoration of consciousness to the individual and as
the means by which 'culture' is mediated via repressive andlor ideological mechanisms.

An alternative theorisation of subjectivity, conceiving of masculinities as enacted within
regimes of historically contingent nomalising practices, is applied to an investigation of
how specific groups of boys learn to relate as gendered subjects in a particular school.
Surveys, observational methods and semi-structured interviews are used to trace the
specific effects of practices implicated in the formation of masculinities for the boys.
Attention is also drawn to the relationship of specific models of masculinity to the boys'
literacy practices.

On the basis of this research, important implications for practice at policy and pedagogical
levels are identified.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Psycholinguistics</field><field name="subject">Social Aspects</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.135338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production of synthetic rutile and by-product iron oxide pigments from ilmenite processing</field><field name="creator">Christopher Ward</field><field name="description">A study has been carried out on the Becher and Summit
Processes with the aim of understanding the mechanism and critical
parameters required for the production of a range of pure iron oxide
pigments, as well as high quality synthetic rutile from reduced
ilmenite .

The Becher Process currently produces a large quantity of
worthless mixed phase iron oxides. However, this study has shown that
the range of iron oxides formed are all derived from the
transformation of lepidocrocite (y-FeOOH) through the solution phase
in iron(II) solutions. The results of a kinetic study of the
transformation of lepidocrocite found that the rate exhibited an
induction period at low pH, was dependent on temperature and was
linearly related to log [H+] and log [Fe2+]. The rate determining step
was found to be the formation of suitable product nuclei, following
dissolution of the initial oxide at the surface of the crystal
lattice.

An electrochemical study of these reactions showed that the
product formed from the transformation of lepidocrocite was a function
of the solution potential and an experimental Eh-pH diagram was
constructed to predict the iron oxide phase produced from hydrolysis
and transformation reactions. The results from this fundamental study
were then applied on both a laboratory and plant scale to produce pure
iron oxide phases.

A modified Summit Process, involving the removal of metallic
iron from the porous reduced ilmenite matrix using FeCl 3, regeneration
of iron(III) and the production of pure iron oxide pigments from the
waste iron(II) chloride solution, was also investigated in detail.

A kinetic study of pure iron dissolution in iron(III)
solutions, comparing three electrochemical techniques and a standard
solution sampling method, gave consistent rate constants provided
allowance was made for the reaction with the proton. The iron
dissolution mechanism was found to be iron(III) diffusion controlled,
while the dissolution in HC1 was under mixed control. A study using
both pure iron and pressed reduced ilmenite discs found that acid
consumption could be minimised by the addition of citrate or by the
addition of A1 3+ or Fe 2+ , which are believed to block the adsorption
of the proton. It was found that iron(III)-citrate complexes inhibited
iron(II1) hydrolysis in the reduced ilmenite pores and enhanced the
purity of the synthetic rutile product.

A study of the oxidation of iron(II) by atmospheric oxygen
using copper(II) and activated carbon catalysts found that these
catalysts were inefficient for complete iron(III) regeneration. The
heating of carbon in the presence of cu2+ was found to enhance the
initial rate of iron(II) oxidation, however it is believed that
surface oxide redox couples formed on the carbon control the iron(II)/
iron(III) ratio in solution, and prevent complete iron(I1) oxidation.
The production of iron oxide pigments under the controlled conditions
afforded by the Summit Process, resulted in superior quality pigments
than are presently attainable from the Becher Process. However,
controlled ageing and crystal growth using waste lepidocrocite from
the Becher Process would result in similar quality pigments being
produced.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ilmenite</field><field name="subject">Iron</field><field name="subject">Rutile</field><field name="subject">Artificial Minerals</field><field name="subject">Salvage</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.150010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mtDNA study of aspects of the recent evolutionary history and phylogeographic structure of selected teleosts in coastal environments of south-western Australia</field><field name="creator">rhoddell@central.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">At present, there is a general lack of information regarding the spatial genetic
architecture and genetic diversity of estuarine and coastal freshwater fish in
Australia or about the interacting intrinsic, extrinsic and historical influences
responsible for sculpting these patterns. This thesis represented the first
investigation of the phylogeographic structure and recent evolutionary histories
of teleost fishes from the coastal and estuarine environments of south-western
Australia, using the resolution afforded by mtDNA sequence data. Available
evidence indicated that, to different degrees, these species have limited
potential for dispersal amongst local assemblages from different water bodies.
As this theoretically reduces the confounding effects of recent gene flow on
extant genetic structure, these fishes were well suited to studying the
influences of historical factors. Historical influences were expected to be
particularly profound, given that these coastal environments underwent
massive modifications during Late Quaternary eustatic fluctuations.

The thesis consists of four major components, which explored different
aspects of interspecific and intraspecific phylogeny and p hylogeograp hy of
three teleost species, based on mtDNA control region and cytochrome b
fragments. First, the relationship between the endemic, 'strictly estuarine'
Leptatherina wallacei (Atherinidae) and the more widespread, 'estuarine &amp;
marine' 6. presbyteroides was examined, with a view to establishing whether
6. wallacei represents a monophyletic or polyphyletic lineage and whether this
species was derived recently (i.e. in Holocene estuaries). Second, the
phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity of L. wallacei were investigated and compared with data from L. presbyteroides, with a view to
using this information to interpret the recent evolutionary histories of each
congener. Third, the divergence between assemblages of L. wallacei
inhabiting two isolated coastal lakes was used to estimate a maximal
substitution rate for the control region, which was then used to infer general
time frames for the divergence between the two Leptatherina species and
between the major phylogeographic partitions within each species. Fourth,
investigations were initiated into phylogeographic patterns and levels of
genetic diversity within and among assemblages of Pseudogobius olorum
(Gobiidae) from several coastal lakes and an estuary.

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the two Leptatherina species were
characterised by exclusive and reciprocally-monophyletic lineages of
haplotypes from both mtDNA regions, supporting the monophyletic origins of
L. wallacei. Both 6. wallacei and 6. presbyteroides exhibited high levels of
genetic diversity and extensive overall subdivision (e.g. Qsr = 0.691 &amp; 0.644
respectively for control region data). There was a profound phylogeographic
break in both species between all conspecific assemblages from the lower
west coast (LWC phylogroup) and all those from the south coast (SC
phylogroup), which suggested the influences of shared extrinsic and/or
historical factors. There was limited genetic structuring within the two major
phylogroups of either Leptatherina species, apparently reflecting recent
connectivity amongst local assemblages, with subsequent fragmentation and
insufficient time for lineage sorting. However, two major phylogeographic
breaks distinguished monophyletic control region phylogroups of L. wallacei from the isolated coastal Lake Clifton and Lake Walyungup, consistent with
their independent evolution following lacustrine entrapment during the
Holocene.

The divergence between these two isolated lacustrine assemblages of
Leptatherina wallaceiformed the basis for an estimate of the maximal
substitution rate of the control region. While these data were unable to
provide a precise estimate of the actual rate of molecular evolution, all the
evidence suggested that it was proceeding very rapidly. The maximal rate
estimate of 172.3% lineage-' MY-' was among the fastest ever reported.
Based on this rate, the two Leptatherina species diverged at least 1 SKya, thus
rejecting a Holocene origin for L. wallacei. The divergence between the LWC
and SC phylogroups of L. wallacei has been ongoing for at least GKya, while
the equivalent divergence in L. presbyteroides has been ongoing for at least
11 Kya. As the time frames of these divergences were consistent with periods
of massive environmental modifications associated with the end-Pleistocene
fall in sea level and the HMT, it was likely that these factors have played
important roles in sculpting the species' divergence and intra-specific genetic
structure. Although useful in temporally scaling genetic divergences within
and between the two Leptatherina species, wider application of this rate
estimate to questions regarding other taxa was limited. For example, evident
rate heterogeneity between the genera precluded its use with even the
relatively closely-related atherinid Atherinosoma elongafa.

Phylogeographic analyses identified high levels of genetic diversity and
extensive genetic subdivision (e.g. st = 0.652 for control region) amongst an
estuarine and several lacustrine assemblages of Pseudogobius olorum,
although phylogeographic structure was shallower than in either Leptatherina
species. There was increased divergence between three assemblages from
the lower west coast and two from the south coast, consistent with the
profound break evident in the Leptatherina. One lacustrine assemblage
appeared to represent a distinct lineage and a preliminary maximal rate
estimate (~61.4% lineage-1 MY-1) was calculated based on the minimum
divergence of this assemblage from its nearest conspecifics. Although slower
than the rate calculated for L. wallacei, this was still high for teleost fishes.

Overall, this study indicated that historical environmental factors, especially
those related to Quaternary eustatic changes, have played important roles in
sculpting the phylogeography and evolution of three teleost species from
south-western Australia. Moreover, as these species have differential
dependencies on estuarine environments (is. 'strictly estuarine' vs 'estuarine
&amp; marine') and represented two different taxonomic groups (i.e. Atherinoidei &amp;
Gobioidei), historical environmental factors may have exerted similar
influences on other coastal species in the region.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">teleost</field><field name="subject">estuaries</field><field name="subject">isolated coastal lakes</field><field name="subject">sea level changes</field><field name="subject">Pleistocene</field><field name="subject">Holocene Marine Transgression</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.162328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religious Confession Privilege at Common Law: A Historical Analysis</field><field name="creator">thompsonak@ldschurch.org</field><field name="description">Since English lawyers started writing text books about the law of evidence, they have denied that religious confession privilege exists at common law. However, that statement of the law surprises those who recognise confessional secrecy dating back into the first millennium AD. It is also counter-intuitive in Federal Australia since the one human freedom which the Constitution has guaranteed since 1901 is the &#147;free exercise of any religion&#148;. 

This thesis analyses the legal conclusion that there is no religious confession privilege at common law against available historical materials. Those materials include the origin of confessional secrecy in Christian practice and the entrenchment of that practice in canon law; the recognition and even the reception of canonical practices in the custom that became the common law; and all the English common law cases that have affirmed or denied religious confession privilege whether in passing or in an arguably precedential way. The reason why clear evidence of the existence of the privilege even seventy years after the English Reformation has been ignored by the text writers is traced to an uncorrected interpretive error made by the text writer Peake in 1801.  His error has been uncritically followed and affirmed by later commentators and judges. However, until Gavan Duffy J decided Cook v Carroll  in Ireland in 1945 and the Supreme Court of Canada decided R v Gruenke  in 1991, there was no reported decision on religious confession privilege anywhere in the British Commonwealth. All else that had been written was at best obiter dicta.

The factors that influenced those two courts to recognise not a narrow religious confession privilege but a more encompassing confidential religious communications privilege are then measured against Australian jurisprudence to suggest whether the High Court of Australia would come to a similar conclusion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Religious</field><field name="subject">Confession</field><field name="subject">Privilege</field><field name="subject">Clergy-Parishioner Privilege</field><field name="subject">Priest-Penitent Privilege</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.94056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A Veritable Augustus": The Life of John Winthrop Hackett, Newspaper Proprietor, Politician and Philanthropist (1848-1916).</field><field name="creator">collins6@westnet.com.au</field><field name="description">Irish-born Sir John Winthrop Hackett (1848-1916) achieved substantial political and social standing in Western Australia through his editorship and part-ownership of the West Australian newspaper, his position as a Legislative Council member and as a layman in the Anglican Church. The thesis illustrates his strong commitment to numerous undertakings, including his major role in the establishment of Western Australia's first University.

This thesis will argue that whatever Hackett attempted to achieve in Western Australia, his philosophy can be attributed to his Irish Protestant background including his student days at Trinity College Dublin. After arriving in Australia in 1875 and teaching at Trinity College Melbourne until 1882, his ambitions took him to Western Australia where he aspired to be accepted and recognised by the local establishment. He was determined that his achievements would not only be acknowledged by his contemporaries, but also just as importantly be remembered in posterity. After a failed attempt to run a sheep station, he found success as part-owner and editor of the West Australian newspaper.

Outside of his business interests, Hackett&#146;s commitment to the Anglican Church was unflagging. At the same time, he was instrumental in bringing about the abolition of state aid to church schools in Western Australia, which he saw as advantaging the Roman Catholic Church. He was a Legislative Council member for 25 years during which time he used his editorship of the West Australian, to campaign successfully on a number of social, industrial and economic issues ranging from divorce reform to the provision of economic infrastructure. As a delegate to the National Australasian Conventions he continually strove to improve the conditions under which Western Australia would join Federation. His crowning achievement was to establish the state&#146;s first university, which he also generously provided for in his will. One of the most influential men in Western Australian history, his career epitomised the energy and ambition of the well-educated immigrant.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Australian</field><field name="subject">politician</field><field name="subject">federation</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church</field><field name="subject">University of Western Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070903.105528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's north-west : a study of exploration, land policy and land acquisition, 1644-1884</field><field name="creator">Cathie Clement</field><field name="description">The thesis analyses the continuum of European activity that preceded establishment of an effective pastoral industry in Australia's north-west. Two strands - physical activity and evolution of legislation - are interwoven, examining growth in geographical knowledge, proposals for colonisation and the outcome of interplay between government officials and landholders over land policy.

Growth in geographical knowledge gave rise to colonisation proposals from 1828. The thesis relates these proposals to events affecting northern Australia to show that promotion and occupation of north-west lands constituted an integral part of the outgrowth of colonial settlement in Australia.

Europeans occupied the north-west in two waves, abortively during the 1860s and continuously from 1879. The existing literature identifies these waves but provides inadequate analysis of events to 1884. The thesis fills this gap by showing that land hunger, misinformation, land speculation, manipulation of legislation and exploitation of political power for private commercial gain determined the shape of north-west settlement. Moreover, by relating land policy to tenure and occupation, it shows that private individuals influenced land policy and impeded official plans for rapid settlement. Thus, the thesis provides a fresh perspective not only on the prelude to effective pastoral settlement in the north-west but on the management of Western Australia's outlying lands in the period before responsible government.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia's North-West</field><field name="subject">Kimberley (W.A.)

The thesis is introduced with an analysis of the decision in relation to the literature of decision making theory, in particul are the two most actively supported decision making theories the rational and the incremental approaches. The thesis demonstrates that the Ord River Scheme accords with the empirical patterns of incremental decision making, The processes of decision making on the Ord River Scheme involved a seemingly endless sequence o f small, incremental and unco-ordinated adjustments on the part of both the Commonwealth and the Western Australian governments.

The initial chapters trace the early exploration of the Kimberley region, the state encouraged experiments in tropical agriculture in the 1920's and the early plans for settlement in, and development of the area. Later chapters analyse the main decisions made by both the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments relating to the development of the region - decisions concerning the establishment of Kimberley Research Station, the construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam and early farming developments. The thesis then examines the attempt by both the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments to inject some rationality into the decision making process on the Ord, in the form of cost benefit analysis , the Commonwealth government's agreement of 1967 t o finance the construction of the Main Ord Dam and finally, the Western Australian government's decision in 1974 to abandon cotton growing.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ord Irrigation Project (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Ord river</field><field name="subject">Kimberley Region</field><field name="subject">Irrigation Scheme</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070905.125500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the effectiveness of treatments for postnatal depression, with the inclusion of men</field><field name="creator">Sarah Jane Davey</field><field name="description">Postnatal depression (PND) is a serious and debilitating condition that disrupts
women's lives at a time when they are already under stress, adapting to the
substantial demands having a baby creates. PND is linked with adverse effects
on the development of the child and the family system, including poor marital
adjustment and elevated levels of depression in male partners. Implications, not
only for men's health, but also for the amount and quality of support men can
provide for their partners and children are far-reaching. Preventative programmes
for the treatment of PND have been widely advocated, but are rare in the
literature. Even fewer, are treatment programmes that include male partners.
This study compared the efficacy of a structured Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
(CBT) programme for the treatment of PND, delivered in 3 different ways, within
an Australian semi-rurallcoastal community. Thirty-nine women, diagnosed with
PND, completed 10 weeks of either 'individual' (n=9), 'group women only' (n=16)
or 'group partners involved' (n=14) intervention and were compared with a control
support group (n=7). Pre-intervention, women in the study reported the presence
of a number of psychosocial risk factors for PND and almost 20% of the men in
this sample were also depressed according to the BDI-II. Partners of the women
in the 'group partners involved' treatment completed a 6-week CBT group
programme especially designed for men (n=13). Partners of the women involved
in the other interventions acted as a control group (n=16). Depression, anxiety,
parenting stress, relationship adjustment and social support measures were
taken using standardized instruments at pre-intervention, post-test and at 3- and
6-month follow-up. Qualitative information about the experiences of PND and the
intervention programme was obtained through focus group interviews. The
intervention programme was evaluated by questionnaire by both participants and
their general practitioners or allied health professionals who had referred them to
the programme. Results indicated that, overall, the 10-week, structured CBT
programme was far more effective in treating PND than attending a support
group. Over time, group therapy outperformed individual therapy for depression
and anxiety. Including partners in intervention meant significantly improved
outcomes at 6-month follow-up for depression, anxiety and relationship
adjustment for women. When male partners were included, women's social
support levels were significantly higher at 3-month follow-up. Post-intervention
men who participated in the men's group were significantly less depressed and
stressed, and showed higher levels of social support than controls. The
intervention programme was rated highly by both participants and referrers for
effectiveness and acceptability, with the psychoeducational information and CBT
strategies rated as the most useful components. Participants viewed the
inclusion of male partners in PND treatment as fundamental and strongly
recommended increased community and professional awareness of PND and its
consequences. The important implications for clinical practice and resource
allocation raised by this study are addressed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postpartum Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">PND</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070905.145404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration, metamorphosis and the residual link : resources of British women to re-invent themselves</field><field name="creator">c.ward@curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">Migration can cause disruption to the normal functioning of the family; especially
women and mothers. In this study a cross sectional approach, using both quantitative
and qualitative methodologies was undertaken to establish the impact of migration
on women fiom the United Kingdom (UK) and Eire (N=154) now living in
Australia; from these participants 40 were selected for in-depth interview. Women
were asked about their experiences of migration and the strategies used to 'settle' in
a new country. The researcher postulated that the process of settlement requires a reinvention
of the self through building new perceptions of culture, country, friends,
and family and the re-definition of the self in relation to these aspects of the
environment. A conceptual model was developed and used to determine and
examine the relationships amongst who and what influenced the decision and
motivation to migrate, the impact of exposure to a new culture, assault on the old
identity and the possible grieving response to the impact of multiple loss (loss of
home, major attachment figure, family, community, culture and social networks).

Bowlby's attachment theory and grieving process was used as a theoretical
framework for the study. Data analysis inQcated that the majority of the women
experienced at least some of the characteristics associated with the stages of the
grieving process and the time-scale and pathway through the process differed
amongst individuals. Women who successfully reached the final stage (reorganisation) of the grieving process were able to "re-invent" themselves using pre
and post-migration strategies (social, cultural and country activities). Participants
who were less able in this transformation or re-invention used more solitary
strategies. Different levels of a sense of belonging and success in re-inventing the
self were linked to the different motivations for migrating. Inability to reach the
stage of re-organisation, even after residency of 20 years or more, resulted in
negative perceptions of the adopted country and continuing psychological distress.
However, even those participants who successfully re-invented themselves
continued to foster a residual link to the homeland. This is interpreted to be the
result of a form of imprinting. Furthermore, women with newborns or young
children identified that the impact of multiple loss, especially loss of a social support
system, had a detrimental impact on their childrearing experiences.

The study has implications for future migrants in assisting them to adjust and
survive in the new country. It also has implications for health professionals to
recognise that all mothers and perhaps especially migrant mothers require a social
support network. Further, the health professional needs to be a part of that network
and also assist the migrant to develop the appropriate shlls to extend their social
support. In addition, immigration and social services and the general population
should recognise and provide for the psychological and physical needs of migrants
of all origrns - English speaking as well as non-English speaking.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Bowlby</field><field name="subject">English speaking</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070905.85058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The need for approval : a psychological study of the influence of Confucian values on the social behaviour of East Asians</field><field name="creator">Stephen Kin Kwok Cheng</field><field name="description">This thesis begins with a critical overview of crosscultural
psychology and a re-examination of the concepts
of emic and etic. It argues that the time has come for
cross-cultural psychology to free itself from the moorings
of its Western, universalistic paradigm and take non-
Western, indigenous psychology seriously, especially that
of East Asia.

To address the need for an East Asian psychology, the
thesis presents an empirical study on the psychological
influence of Confucianism on East Asians. It hypothesises
that the Confucian values of filiality, propriety and
harmony induce a strong need for approval and a range of
approval-seeking behaviours in the individual. In
contrast, the Western values of individuation, autonomy
and conflict induce a strong need for independence and a
range of independence-seeking behaviours.

To test this hypothesis, a 26-item, 5-point Likert scale
was developed and'administered to 1625 university students
across East Asia, which include East Asian samples from
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Singapore and Taiwan, as well as Caucasian samples from
Australia, United Kingdom and the United States.

The study has confirmed its hypothesis that the Confucian
values of filiality, propriety and harmony characterise
the approval-driven social behaviours of East Asians and
that the values of individuation, autonomy and conflict
characterise the independence-driven social behaviours of
Westerners. However, it has also found that, contrary to
many long-held assumptions, there are significant
differences in the way Confucian values have exerted their
respective influence on the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and
other East Asians.

The findings suggest not only that the culturally induced
need for approval can be used as an overarching construct
for the psychological study of East Asians from an
indigenous perspective, but also that the innovative model
used in this study can be applied to the study of other
indigenous psychologies as well. More significantly, the
study has found that, in contrast to the need for divine
approval which has motivated the achievements of European
Protestants in the past, the need for human approval is
what characterises the achievement motivation and
behaviours of Confucian East Asians today.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social acceptance</field><field name="subject">East Asia</field><field name="subject">Crosscultural Studies</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Confucianism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070905.91821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food Policy Councils: An Examination of Organisational Structure, Process, and Contribution to Alternative Food Movements</field><field name="creator">rebecca.schiff@mail.mcgill.ca</field><field name="description">The contemporary global food system is plagued by a myriad of problems.  In recognition of the problematic nature of the conventional food system, practitioners and researchers have sought, throughout the past century, alternative, sustainable food production, consumption, and exchange systems. Some of the solutions proposed for these problems suggest the establishment of new institutional forms such as that of the food policy council, an organisation which, through the embodiment of a food systems perspective, proposes innovative local and regional level solutions to food systems problems.

Over the past two decades numerous food policy councils (FPCs) have been created in North America and Australia.  Research on FPCs still remains minimal, leaving many gaps in knowledge as to the role of these organisations concerning the ways that they can and do contribute to the sustainable development of food systems and &#145;alternative food movements&#146;.  Research to date on the organisational structure of FPCs lacks consideration of organisation theory and the relatively substantial body of literature dealing with evaluation of collaborative, interagency organisations, an organisational type closely related to FPCs.  There is a lack of consideration as to definition of the role of FPCs within the broader context of sustainable food systems movements and the procedures and protocol for effectiveness in achieving outcomes and fulfilling these roles.

Considering the significant gaps in knowledge, this research focusses on identifying a clear definition of the mission or roles of FPCs and investigates some of the previously unexplored organisational characteristics of FPCs as a foundation for identifying what may lead to &#145;best-practice&#146; organisational structure and process in fulfilling these roles.  Since there is limited information and research to date specifically on FPCs, a qualitative and more specifically grounded theory approach was taken to provide an exploratory and reflexive research design framework.  This design incorporated a continuous, interactive layering of data collection, classification, and analysis.  Following a preliminary literature review, the inquiry focussed primarily on the gathering of information directly from FPCs involving several different types and sources of data.

Research findings revealed several aspects of food policy council objectives that can be considered together as defining the organisational role of FPCs.  This provides a basis for determining the most effective administrative structure and operations management for fulfilling this role.  Findings and analysis also indicated certain components of structure and process that can lead to effectiveness in terms of capacity building and fulfilling organisational roles.  A model of FPC structure is developed and presented to summarise these findings, considering those components revealed through the research as contributing most to effective FPC operation.  The development of this model from a broad and diverse representative sample, indicates that such modelling of structure and process may be applicable to transferring the concept of and creating FPCs in new locations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food systems</field><field name="subject">food policy and planning</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">organisational structure</field><field name="subject">social movements</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">c</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070906.103640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building successful franchises: The influence of franchise heterogeneity and relationship management on franchise success</field><field name="creator">C.Inma@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Franchising is a form of business arrangement which has been claimed to offer a high possibility of business success. The reason for its growing support may be due to the benefits franchising offers to the individuals (franchisees), the organisations (franchisors), the public and the whole economy. The notion that franchising offers a successful guarantee for business operations warrants investigation into what factors contribute to likely success.

The characteristics of franchise firms have been identified as a significant factor in ensuring franchise success. In this study, franchise firms were classified into four groups using hierarchical cluster analysis: the beginners, the developers, the growers and the matures. The profiles were tested against reported performance measures, indicating that franchise firms in the growing group outperform firms in other groups. However, this is only one component which may influence a successful franchise development.

Relationship management is a second, critical area in building a strong franchise network. Some significant relationship building factors are explored in this thesis.  Control, influence strategy, franchisee information asymmetry and communication strategy were found to be significant factors which lead to franchise competitive advantage.  The results show that control and coercive influence strategy negatively influence franchise outcomes, while noncoercive influence strategy, information asymmetry and communication strategy positively enhance the franchise relationship. The results of multiple regression analyses also indicate that the combined effects of these franchise strategies have a significant impact on franchise outcomes; namely,  financial performance, franchise goal congruence and franchisee satisfaction.  

The findings suggest that franchise firms can adjust their strategies to enhance their business success.  Control, influence, information and information strategies can be used to maintain and induce healthy franchise relationships within the franchise dyad. The study also significantly extends the existing understanding of franchise heterogeneity theories, key criteria of franchise business competitiveness, the unique business relationship between franchisor and franchisee and franchise factors contributing to franchise success in the current franchising literature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">management control</field><field name="subject">influence strategy</field><field name="subject">relationship management</field><field name="subject">franchise success</field><field name="subject">and cluster analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070912.173434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality Assurance of the Assessment Process in Brunei Darussalam Vocational and Technical Education: Stakeholders' Perceptions and Future Challenges</field><field name="creator">ashri_ha@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">&#145;Quality&#146; and &#145;quality assurance&#146; in education have become global issues in the last decade. Educational institutions around the world are focusing on designing and implementing quality assurance systems to ensure students a high quality of education. In many countries, including Brunei Darussalam, the development of a national system of quality assurance in education has sometimes brought confusion and controversy. The main reason for this stems from the conflicting perspectives of different interest groups: mainly governments, administrators and academic staff, but students, employers and the general public also have significant voices. All, of course, are committed to quality but each regards quality in a slightly different way. 

This study set out to explore the perceptions of two groups of stakeholders, administrators and teachers, about the quality assurance system and in particular, the quality assurance of the assessment process in vocational and technical education (VTE) in Brunei Darussalam. The study examined the stakeholders&#146; understanding of the term quality and the significance of quality assurance measures. It assessed the extent to which these measures have been utilised by the Department of Technical Education (DTE) and its Vocational and Technical Education Institutions (VTEIs) and it also examined the challenges facing DTE and its VTEIs in ensuring quality VTE. 

A mixed-method research approach was used in this investigation, including document analysis, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The results provide insights into stakeholders&#146; perceptions of quality and a range of purposes for quality assurance system implementation. The effectiveness of the current system based on an external moderation system generated mixed views. The study identified the lack of a structured comprehensive quality assurance system for the assessment process in the DTE and VTEIs and highlighted ways in which quality assurance of the assessment process measures are currently formulated. Both groups of stakeholders agreed that there are challenges confronting the DTE and its VTEIs. Several recommendations were made to improve the current quality assurance measures. The study was timely in light of the increased interest in shaping quality assurance mechanisms in VTE in Brunei Darussalam. 

Overall this study carries implications for a better understanding of quality in VTE and issues related to the implementation of a quality assurance system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality assurance</field><field name="subject">Vocational and technical education</field><field name="subject">Vocational education and training</field><field name="subject">Brunei</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070917.103229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of methods for detection and eradication of mouse parvovirus from a laboratory mouse colony</field><field name="creator">efilipov@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The mouse parvovirus designated MPV can infect laboratory mice and affect the humoral and cellular immune response of infected mice, reducing their value for biomedical and medical research. The development and maintenance of MPV-free mouse colonies for biomedical research is therefore essential and requires routine monitoring of the infection status of mice, using serological surveillance procedures.

Recent experience in the Animal Resources Centre (ARC), a major supplier of mice to the medical research community in Australia, was that MPV infection was present but was not detectable with the serological tests that were then in routine use.

This thesis reports the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of the MPV in the ARC mouse colonies, the genetic characteristics of the strain of MPV detected, the development of a recombinant virus protein that provided a suitable antigen for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Western immunoblot (WIB) assay for the detection of MPV antibodies, and use of these various assays to determine aspects of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the infection that were critical to the eradication of virus infection and future immunological surveillance to ensure the absence of infection.

The recombinant protein produced as an antigen was a biotinylated fusion protein, a truncated capsid protein of the strain of MPV detected in the ARC, and was produced using the PinpointTM vector and with expression in Escherichia coli. The protein was produced as an insoluble intracellular product within inclusion bodies and was solubilised using urea and purified. The purified protein was utilised as an antigen for ELISA and the WIB assays to detect virus antibody in infected mice.

The outbreak of MPV infection in the ARC was used as an unique opportunity for assessment of the seroprevalence of MPV-1 infection in a large laboratory mouse colony and to utilise this data to determine the sampling size needed to reliably detect MPV-1 infection within such large laboratory mouse colonies. An overall seroprevalence of 16.5% was detected using the developed serological tests, but considerable variation in prevalence was detected in different mouse strains.

The response to MPV infection of 4 different but common strains of mice was determined as a basis for developing appropriate surveillance procedures and the selection of appropriate sentinel animals. The effect of infection of these strains at different ages was also investigated. Virus replication was detected in tissues of all the mice strains infected (outbred ARC(s) and inbred C57BL/6JArc, BALB/c and BALB/c-Foxn1nu/Arc) as juveniles and adults, with the exception of C57BL/6JArc inoculated as adults. However, while seroconversion in mice inoculated as juveniles and adults was detected in ARC(s) and C57BL/6JArc mice, it was not detected in BALB/c mice. The high rate of seroconversion to MPV, the early and prolonged development of an immune response, and the lack of age differences in their susceptibility indicated that ARC(s) mice would provide reliable sentinels for the detection of MPV.

The genomic nucleotide sequence of the ARC strain, excluding the terminal palindromic regions and the predicted amino acid sequences of the non-structural and structural proteins was determined. This strain was very similar (98-99% nucleotide identity) to the previously described MPV strains MPV-1a, MPV-1b and MPV -1c. The similarity suggested there were unlikely to be significant antigenic differences in the proteins of the ARC strain and those strains of MPV reported previously.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MPV</field><field name="subject">Serological Methods</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Protein</field><field name="subject">ARC</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070918.145210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Government Decision-Making and Environmental Degradation: A Study relating to Mining Activities in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">frcarr@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a country possessing abundant resources of gold, oil, copper, timber, and fish stocks. It is hampered in its development and management of these resources, however, by serious problems of governance and corruption. These problems are evident throughout the economy and also in the management of the environment. The level of environmental damage caused by the mining industry in PNG is now such that it will require extensive rehabilitation, if the areas affected can, indeed, ever be fully rehabilitated. The mining companies which precipitated this damage were licensed and encouraged by the PNG Government in the initiation and exercise of the mining operations. The resulting environmental impact has affected the lives of thousands of New Guineans to their detriment. The degradation caused remains
unredressed.

Compounding the problem, there is a growing reliance by Papua New Guinea on mineral exploitation for foreign direct investment, government revenues, and foreign exchange. Gold exports accounted for the biggest share of export revenues in 2002 representing 37.5% of the total. In light of this growing dependency on mining activities, there is a correspondingly urgent requirement to address the deficiencies in the administrative, monitoring, and policing aspects of the protection of its environment.

Despite the public evidence of the damage to the environment and the ensuing affect on the people of Papua New Guinea by mining activities; and despite universal condemnation of these activities and the companies responsible; the companies continue to conduct these activities without official hindrance and with little apparent concern for the long-term ramifications of their actions.

This thesis will examine the degradation resulting from the mining activities of companies in Papua New Guinea over the last three decades &#150; particularly those of Placer Dome&#146;s Porgera gold mine, BHP&#146;s Ok Tedi gold and copper mine (the waste from both of which is dumped into the Ok Tedi and Strickland rivers which are tributaries of the Fly River and form part of the Fly River system) and Lihir Gold Limited's gold mine on Lihir Island. It will examine the extent to which the Government of Papua New Guinea may have wittingly (in the sense of a prescience as to the possible or probable likelihood of deleterious impact) or unwittingly contributed to that degradation as a result of its actions or omissions.

Studies of available literature suggest that there has been little attention paid to the subject of culpability on the part of successive PNG governments in matters of environmental damage. This research will contribute to reducing this gap in the literature by focusing on possible motives of the PNG government and its actors which precipitated those decisions and which resulted in environmental degradation. The discussion will examine the likely motivation of the PNG government in its deliberations and decisions and the extent to which corruption and incompetence may have played a role.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Government decision-making</field><field name="subject">environmental degradation</field><field name="subject">environmental damage</field><field name="subject">natural resource depletion</field><field name="subject">government corruptio</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070918.155827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the Coping Skills of Submariners: An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Skills Based Stress Management Training</field><field name="creator">cindy@macknsons.com</field><field name="description">Submariners are exposed to a unique range of stressors, such as cramped living conditions, lack of privacy, extended periods of isolation and confinement, lack of sunlight, and constant threat. These are in addition to those associated with the military environment. Due to the dangers of the work and potential for disastrous consequences, submariners need to be emotionally stable and possess good coping skills. Previous research on the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Submarine Service indicated a need for further support to improve individual coping and organisational outcomes. Based on this research, current attitudes towards Submarine Service were examined, such as views on working hours, job demands, training and preparation, and being a submariner. Going one step further, this study investigated the effectiveness of a multimodal cognitive behavioural workplace stress management intervention with RAN submariners. A quasi-experimental design was employed and the eight-session intervention was conducted with operational submariners whilst they were working on shore. Work outcomes measured included job satisfaction, job performance, and sickbay attendance, and psychological outcomes examined were stress and strain symptoms, depression, anxiety, coping resources, health and general wellbeing. These outcomes were assessed through self-report both at sea and on shore. Stress symptoms, vocational strain, interpersonal strain, and role overload strain all decreased after the intervention, and use of social support as a coping resource and confidence in job performance both increased. Unfortunately, however, these changes were not sustained in the sea-going environment. These results are discussed in light of previous research, and recommendations for the organisation and for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">workstress strain</field><field name="subject">stress management</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070918.160435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pentecostalism and Sustainability: Conflict or Convergence?</field><field name="creator">sheppardk@douglaspartners.com.au</field><field name="description">Sustainability has become a prominent global project through which peoples and nations are seeking to alleviate poverty and stop environmental degradation. This thesis explores the contribution that Pentecostalism, a global religious movement of some 500 million people, can make to this project at the several levels of practice, political economy and philosophy.

After an initial chapter where the challenges and dimensions of the sustainability project are outlined, the development and characteristics of Pentecostalism as a dynamic global movement are reviewed. This sets the context for a central empirical case study of Citipointe Christian Outreach Centre (a Pentecostal megachurch in Brisbane, Australia). Survey data, content analysis of sermons, and in depth interviews show how one particular congregation is engaging with the social, economic and environmental issues of sustainability. I conclude that although Citipointe&#146;s engagement with sustainability issues at a practical level is weak, their demonstrated commitment to community building and the congregation&#146;s shared worldview indicate potential for a more constructive engagement. In light of global Pentecostal praxis I suggest that Pentecostalism holds greater potential to engage with sustainability than is being realised at Citipointe.

This thesis contributes to our understanding of how and why Pentecostals are already engaging in social, economic and environmental issues. More broadly, it develops our understanding of the role Pentecostal Christianity can play in sustainability. This thesis proposes that while Pentecostalism can contribute to sustainability at the level of practice, it can make a deeper contribution by addressing the worldview challenge of sustainability. Pentecostal Christianity does this because it can keep the sustainability discourse open to a wider discussion about God, truth and the purpose of life, rather than limit it to matters of science, technology and public policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pentecostal</field><field name="subject">Pentecostalism</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Christian Outreach Centre</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070918.94404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mythic Reconstruction: A Study of Australian Aboriginal and South African Literatures</field><field name="creator">esosaghae@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore the intention of postcolonial Australian Aboriginal and Indigenous South African postcolonial writers in reconstructing cultural and historical myths. The predominant concerns of this thesis are the issues of Representation and Historiography as they are constructed in the four primary texts namely Dr Wooreddy&#146;s Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World, The Heart of Redness, The Kadaitcha Sung and Woza Albert!

It begins with a summary journey into the concepts of the postcolonial, presenting some of the challenges with which the concept has been confronted finding nonetheless it enabling as an &#145;anticipatory discourse&#146; in appreciating the literatures from once-colonised nations such as Australia and South Africa.

I then take a cursory look at the concept of myth while focussing on how writers like Sam Watson and Barney, Mtwa and Mbogeni put such cultural myths as the Biamee deity in The Kadaitcha Sung and the second coming of Jesus in Woza Albert! to use.

In the next section, I focus on how the writers Mudrooroo (then Colin Johnson) in Australia and Mda from South Africa confront and reconstruct some of the historical myths upon which European colonialism was founded, using the texts, Dr Wooreddy&#146;s Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World and The Heart of Redness.

The achievement of this thesis has simply been one of the canonical expansions recommended of postcolonial criticism; the stressing an appreciation of the differences that exist even when postcolonial writers seek to achieve the same goal with their literatures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colonialism</field><field name="subject">Postcolonial</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070928.143608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterochrony of Ageing of Adult Cerebral Hemispheres and Relationships with Emotion Function, Mood and Social Engagement</field><field name="creator">J.Fitzgerald@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">A number of studies have suggested that the right cerebral hemisphere declines, functionally, more rapidly, and to a greater degree, than does the left hemisphere, as the human adult ages. Furthermore, research has suggested a possible link between age by gender-related changes in cognitive function and changes in mood and levels of social engagement.

Importantly, a literature search identified that no previous study has employed a divided visual field experimental technique, where emotionally valenced verbal stimuli have been presented, in order to test whether selective impairment of right cerebral hemisphere functioning is associated with normal adult ageing. Nor has any study investigated associations between age, gender, levels of social engagement, mood, and performances in the perception of both emotionally valenced verbal stimuli and facial affect.

The present study investigated whether a selective impairment of right cerebral hemispheric cognitive functioning, in relation to emotion perception, is associated with normal adult ageing. In addition, the present study explored whether any relationships exist between an age-related and/or age by gender-related right cerebral hemispheric cognitive impairment, problems with mood, and deficits in social engagement. Two divided visual field experiments were conducted: one divided visual field experiment employed verbal stimuli, and the other, facial image stimuli. These two experiments attempted to assess changes, with adult ageing, in hemispheric specialisation for the perception of emotion by
tachistoscopically presenting valenced (positive, neutral, or negative) verbal and facial image stimuli, within a divided visual field experimental paradigm. The studies were conducted across two groups (an old group and a young group of subjects), whilst controlling for gender, handedness and verbal ability of subjects. The dependent variables in these two experiments were the subjects' reaction times to the stimuli, accuracy of identification of the emotional valence of the stimuli, and response biases to these stimuli.

The data derived from the verbal divided visual field and facial image divided visual field experiments did not indicate any changes in relation to the laterality of emotion perception as the adult human being ages. Importantly, though, the results from both of the aforementioned experiments revealed that the older group of subjects responded more slowly and less accurately to the emotionally valued stimuli than did the younger group of subjects, suggesting that deficits in emotion perception occur with adult ageing.

In addition, the results suggested age by gender-specific relationships, whereby an overall lowering in cognitive ability for older men was associated with a lowering in ability to accurately perceive the emotional valence of the stimuli. For older women it was found that a lowering in cognitive ability largely mediated by the left cerebral hemisphere was associated with a lowering in ability to accurately perceive the emotional valence of the stimuli, whilst cognitive ability for young persons was not associated with this variable. The data also suggested that for the young women, a heightened level of cognitive ability largely mediated by the left cerebral hemisphere was associated with a lowering in satisfaction with their level of social interaction, whereas a heightened level of cognitive ability largely mediated by the right cerebral hemisphere was associated with a heightened level of mood disturbance.

Gender-specific relationships were also found, whereby for both the older and younger women, a heightened level of mood disturbance was associated with a lowering in satisfaction with their level of social interaction, whilst for both the older and younger men these variables had no relationship.

Furthermore, an age by gender-specific relationship was revealed, whereby for the older men, a heightened level of satisfaction with their level of social interaction was associated with a heightened level of social engagement, whilst for the young men, and both the young and older women, these variables had no relationship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Engagement</field><field name="subject">Emotion Function</field><field name="subject">Mood</field><field name="subject">Cerveral Hemispheres</field><field name="subject">Age</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071002.101145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similarities and differences of ecosystems in Mediterranean Australia and Southern Africa, with special reference to infertile sites at the Barrens and the Caledon coast</field><field name="creator">Antoni Milewski</field><field name="description">Similar ecosystems may be expected where climates and landforms on different continents match. The most detailed tests of such convergence have examined mediterranean areas of Europe, North and South America. This thesis compares mediterranean Australia and southern Africa, two relatively nutrientpoor areas largely neglected in previous studies. Inparticular, two study areas very similar in climate, landform and soils were compared, one at the Barrens on the south coast of Western Australia and the other at the Caledon coast in the southwestern Cape of South Africa.

The less frequent, but heavier, rain in Australia probably led t o the anomalous presence of trees there. The height and density of vegetation appeared only weakly related to soil nutrients but strongly correlated with moisture. Conversely, nutrient status rather than climate appeared to govern many of those features of plants that interacted with animals, such as flowers and fruits . This applied particularly to ants, which took seeds bearing elaiosomes, and birds, which took fleshy fruits . Soil fertility thus determined the occurrence of agents which both consumed plants and aided their propagation. Climate, soil and fire, together with the consequent regimes of fiutrient cycling and predation, determined the relativeroles played by endotherms, such as mammals, and by ectotherms, such as reptiles, amphibians and their invertebrate prey.

Despite close matching, small differences in physical factors remained between the two study areas, with commensurate differences in their biological communities. It is suggested that co-adaptation is not a major cause of differences between ecosystems on different continents but rather a consequence of inevitable differences in physical conditions.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caledon</field><field name="subject">Biotic communities</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Ecosystems</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071002.140328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of diet on the expression of swine dysentery in experimentally infected pigs</field><field name="creator">Peter.Siba@pngimr.org.pg</field><field name="description">Swine dysentery (SD) is a severe mucohaemorrhagic colitis resulting from infection with the anaerobic spirochaetal bacterium, Serpulina hyodysenteriae. The disease affects weaner and grower pigs throughout the world, and causes significant financial losses due to mortality, decreased rate of growth, poor feed conversion, and expense of chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that despite the presence of S. hyodysenteriae in pigs on many farms, clinical signs of SD do not always occur. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of diet on the clinical expression of SD. The ultimate aim was to identify diets that could be used to prevent or control the disease.

One hundred and seventy-eight weaner pigs were purchased from specific-pathogen free farms and fed one of 16 diets based on: cooked riceanimal protein, cooked rice-dehulled lupin, wheat-lupin, wheat-animal protein, parboiled rice dehulled lupin, parboiled rice-animal protein, and processed (hammer-milled or steam-flaked) cereal grains (barley, groats, maize, sorghum and wheat) supplemented with animal protein. Eighty four pigs on these diets were slaughtered after one month to measure the influence of the diets on parameters in the large intestine, including organ sizes, and pH, VFA concentrations and dry matter content of the digesta in the caecum, and proximal and distal colon. The cooked rice-animal protein diet caused low levels of microbial fermentation in the large intestine of pigs as indicated by higher pH values, lower VFAs, smaller intestinal organ sizes, and drier contents in the colon and rectum, compared to pigs on the other diets. A limited amount of fermentative substrates from the cooked rice-animal protein diet entered the large intestine, and this led to a low microbial fermentation activity. Pigs fed diets containing cereal grains, parboiled rice and or dehulled lupins had greater fermentative activity in the large intestine. Parboiled rice unexpectedly was not easily digestible. Of the processed cereal grain diets, steam-flaked grains resulted in significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) intestinal pH values than hammer-milled grains. This suggested that steam-flaking process made the nutrients (most likely starch) more available for digestion in the small intestine than did the hammer-milling process.

Another 94 pigs fed on the various diets were orally challenged with broth cultures of S, hyodysenteriae and were monitored for faecal excretion of spirochaetes, and for the development of SD. Diseased pigs were slaughtered immediately, and healthy pigs were slaughtered after 4-6 weeks, and changes in the large intestine were recorded. None of 16 challenged pigs fed cooked rice-animal protein developed SD and it was assumed that the reduced fermentation with this diet inhibited colonisation by S. hyodysenteriae, and expression of SD. Disease occurred in varying numbers of pigs fed all the other diets, for example cooked rice-dehulled lupin (83.3%), wheat-dehulled lupin (62.5%) and wheat-animal protein (60%). The diseased pigs developed diarrhoea with blood and mucus, were depressed, lacked appetite and showed gross and microscopic evidence of severe mucohaemorrhagic colitis. When two pigs fed the protective cooked rice-animal protein diet were transferred to the wheat-dehulled lupin diet, one died of acute clostridial enterotoxaemia, whilst the other developed SD. This provided further evidence for the protective effect of the cooked rice-animal protein diet.

Of the processed cereal grain types, steam-flaked maize and steam-flaked sorghum diets containing animal protein protected all pigs against SD, although small numbers of animals were used. All cereal-based diets resulted in greater fermentation than the cooked rice-animal protein diets, but fermentation was relatively reduced with steam flaked maize.

The protective rice-animal protein diet was fed to pigs on a commercial piggery with SD. It resulted in good growth rate and carcass composition, but unfortunately no disease occurred amongst the control pigs during the experiment, so its efficacy against SD in the field could not be assessed.

In conclusion, all protective diets were based on cooked cereal grains which had low levels of non-starch polysaccharides and resistant starch (cooked rice, steam-flaked maize and steam-flaked sorghum) and animal protein. It appears that reducing the availability of such fermentable substrate in the large intestine prevents colonisation by S. hyodysenteriae, and protects pigs from developing SD. This is a major new paradigm for the control of this important disease.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swine dysentery</field><field name="subject">Spirochetes</field><field name="subject">Diet in disease</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071003.113611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and ecotourism industry of the whale shark Rhincodon typus in North-Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Bradley  Michael Norman</field><field name="description">The conservation status of the widely-distributed whale shark Rhincodon typus is presently listed as 'Indeterminate - Data Deficient'. One of the main hindrances to obtaining biological data on whale sharks that is relevant to determining its 'conservation status' is that this species has rarely been recorded as occurring in sufficient numbers to obtain quantitative data. However, R. typus does form aggregations at Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), Western Australia, annually between March and June. This has enabled studies to be made of aspects of the biology of R. typus and of the possible impacts of the ecotourism industry on this species.

Using a position provided on vessels involved with the whale shark ecotourism industry at NMP, R. typus was observed on 360 separate occasions in 1995, 1996 and 1997, and it was possible to sex 90.3% of these sharks. The majority of the sexed sharks (84.6%) were male and ranged in length from 4 to 12 m, with a mean of 7.4 m, while the females ranged in length from 4.5 to 8.5 m, with a mean of 6.2 m. The size and degree of abrasion of the claspers was used as an indicator of whether or not a male shark had mated. Using such criteria, it was estimated that male whale sharks start to mature at ca 8 m and that ca 50% are mature by the time they reach 8.6m.

Observations suggested that R. typus feeds by using both suction and flow-through mechanisms. The prey that were observed being ingested included coral spawn, tropical krill, mysids and small jellyfish. The contents of a faecal sample contained parts of the exoskeleton of copepods and the scales of small fishes. The degree of mouth distension, which is assumed to be related to feeding activity, was low during most observation periods.

Photographs of the scars and natural patterning on the skin of individual sharks were used to construct a photographic library for subsequent identification of these sharks. The features used for identifying individual sharks were chosen because they were considered likely to remain for a protracted period. The Whale Shark Photo -identification Library that was produced provides details on the characteristic features of 52 R. typus that were present at NMP. Six individuals were recorded at NMP in both 1995 and 1996, four in both 1996 and 1997, and one in both 1995 and 1997. No identified whale sharks were recorded in all three years.

Rhincodon typus was distributed widely throughout NMP, with most boat and aerial sightings lying within 1 - 2 Ism of the reef crest between Tantabiddi and Turquoise Bay. Rhincodon typus was typically sighted in water depths of 10 to 30 m. The sharks were predominantly travelling parallel to Ningaloo Reef, with significantly more moving in a northward than southward direction. Acoustic tracking of R. typus in 1997 suggested that this species remains within NMP for extended periods and is at the surface for ca 17% of daylight hours.

The number and species of fauna observed to be associated with R. typus were recorded, and a new species of copepod, Pandarus sp. nov., which lives on the skin of R. typus has been described. Golden trevally (Gnathanodon speciosus), miscellaneous trevally (Carangid sp.), remora (Remora sp.) and slender suckerfish (Echeneis naucrates) were common. The prevalence of Pandarus sp. nov. was inversely proportional to the number of Remora sp. and E. mucrates in 1996, while the opposite was true in 1997, suggesting that Pandarus sp. nov. were preyed on by these diskfish.

Rhincodon typus is the basis of the ecotourism industry that operates within NMP each year. While there was considerable variation in the number of tour vessels searching for whale sharks at NMP each year, the greatest mean number of vessels operating per week in successive whale shark seasons were 6.7 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1995, 6.1 during Week 7 (April 12 - 18) of 1996 and 6.9 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1997. The greatest mean numbers of whale sharks sighted per week in each year were 5.1 during Week 14 (May 31 - June 6) of 1995,4.2 during Week 6 (April 5 - 11) of 1996 and 4.1 during Week 8 (April 19 - 25) of 1997.

Tourists, who were permitted to swim alongside R. tyus, interacted with sharks for a mean period of 19.3 rnin in 1995, 14.2 min in 1996 and 9.5 rnin in 1997. The reduction in the duration of interaction in three successive years suggests that, over time, R. typus may have become slightly less tolerant of the ecotourism industry at NMP. The mean minimum distance between vessel and shark during each interaction was 20.7 m in 1995, 21.3 m in 1996 and 31.0 m in 1997. The mean minimum distance between tourist and shark during each interaction was 1.5 m in 1995, 2.05 m in 1996, and 2.1 m in 1997. The mean minimum distance of vessel and tourist from R. typus during each individual interaction decreased as the duration of the interaction increased. Therefore, both R. typus and this industry must be carefully monitored to ensure that the impacts of humans are kept to a minimum and thereby ensure that whale sharks return to NMP each year.

An ethology of whale shark behaviours, which included banking, porpoising, diving and eye-rolling, was produced in an attempt to determine whether there is evidence that the ecotourism industry has a negative impact on R. opus at NMP. The frequency of behavioural change was greatest in the first 0 - 5 min of an observation. Eye-rolling by R. typus was recorded as a reaction to flash-photography, while banking was often recorded when SCUBA was used and/or tourists swam beneath the head of the shark. The swimming speed of R. typus at NMP was rarely too fast for tourists to maintain proximity to the sharks.

Several sharks possessed both recent and healed scars, which were probably inflicted by vessel contact. The recent wounds indicate that vessels had caused injuries to R. typus within NMP. These individuals tended to display a higher frequency of avoidance behaviours and reduced interaction times. 

Recommendations are provided to the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management which are aimed at reducing the potential deleterious effects of the ecotourism industry on the whale sharks at NMP.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Whale shark Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Ningaloo Marine Park</field><field name="subject">Ecotourism</field><field name="subject">Rhincodon Typus</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071003.121017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Values and identity in public relations practice in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">synmul@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This is a study of values and identity within the public relations profession in Malaysia.
Although the study has a national focus, its implications are global, because its context
is created by the intersection of three current areas of debate and examination: I) the
renewed focus on Asian values which seeks to articulate Asian values as a way of
supporting Asia's pathway to modernisation; 2) the open challenge to assumptions
about the transferability of theory between countries around the world, about whether
theory can be universal or whether different theories or different versions of theories
are needed to help explain practice in different parts of the world; and 3) the reemerging
focus on values underwriting the public relations profession.

Malaysia's growing public relations profession is playing a crucial communication role
in support of the country's move towards industrialisation. In Malaysia, issues of
culture, modernisation, Westernisation, and globalisation are both real and topical.

Through the values framework, the study aims to contribute in three ways: 1) To
develop and test an alternative, but equally useful, framework and method for
comparing public relations practice between countries; 2) to investigate the influence
of specific cultural and professional variables on public relations practice in Malaysia,
to hrther understand specific variables which might lead public relations practice to
differ between countries; and 3) to contribute to the definition of Asian values by
defining one component, that is, the personal and professional values of a sample of
public relations practitioners in Malaysia.

The research was undertaken in two parts. The first, using a survey and structured
interviews, examined the influence of two cultural variables (ethnicity and gender) and
two professional variables (years of experience and work environment) on values held.
Ethnicity and years of experience led to significant differences in the values held, with
each variable influencing different value dimensions. Gender and work environment
had some influence but generally in combination with ethnicity and years of experience
respectively. The study found a distinctive U-shaped curve related to years of
experience, which means that practitioners' value priorities change as they gain more
experience in the profession. All four of the variables studied could be significant in
accounting for difference in professional practice in other countries.

The second part, using repertory grid methodology, examined values and identity. It
identified core values central to public relations practice in Malaysia, and interpreted
these core values as statements of self-identity. The nature of identity as a public
relations practitioner may also account for differences in public relations practice
between countries.

Combining both parts, the study has revealed values that underwrite public relations
practice in Malaysia, the aspects of self-identity important to the profession, and the
way in which those values and identity have been influenced by cultural and
professional factors. It therefore leads towards the development of a theoretical
foundation for "culture-specific" public relations in Malaysia.

This exploratory study has generated findings which challenge the expectations of
Schwartz and Bilsky's values theory, on which the values analysis was based.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">Values Asia</field><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071003.94825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rewriting the Story: The Development and Evaluation of a Group Treatment Program for Adolescent Girls who have Experienced Sexual Abuse</field><field name="creator">kelshaun@bigpond.net.au</field><field name="description">Although group treatment is often advocated for survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), few studies have examined the effects of such treatments, particularly with adolescents. Yet adolescence is an important time for survivors of CSA as this is when they may truly begin to process what it means to have been sexually abused as a child (Berliner, 1991; Thun, Sims, Adams, &amp; Webb, 2002). Consequently, this study sought to evaluate and develop best practice evidence for group treatment of adolescent girls who have experienced sexual abuse. The study used both a developmental intervention research approach to guide the development of a best practice intervention; and an action research, mixed methods program evaluation to achieve detailed examination of a small number of client cases so as to ethically assess the effectiveness of the intervention. In keeping with the intervention research approach and with the aim of providing specific knowledge about treatment for CSA survivors that was unattainable through reviewing treatment outcome studies, an initial study was undertaken which retrospectively and prospectively assessed a locally available treatment program for adolescent girls. This study found the locally available treatment approach was unlikely to have been effective at alleviating distress associated with CSA but that past participants and their mothers felt that such a program is important. Recommendations were made on the elements necessary to construct a more clinically responsive and effective treatment. A 16 week Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioural group treatment program was then developed. This pilot treatment program was evaluated in Study 2, using both formative and summative program evaluation methods with four adolescent girls (aged 13-18). The summative findings support the utility of the treatment program and positive benefits were noted for each group participant, including reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The formative findings indicated that the treatment program was in need of further refinement. This included altering some session content, placing more focus on group process and including parents in the treatment. The recommendations of Study 2 were subsequently implemented and the revised treatment program was evaluated by experts in the field to enhance its content validity. The treatment program was then further evaluated in Study 3 using similar evaluation methods with five girls aged 12-15. Clinically significant changes were obtained for four of these five participants, as indicated by triangulation of data from the participants, their parents and group facilitators. Formative findings indicated that the program used in Study 3 was a significant improvement on the program used in Study 2. The major curative factor for participants appeared to lie in the group process and attendance at the program. Treatment was found to have a high degree of acceptability according to participants, parents and facilitators and was implemented with integrity, although flexibility and individualisation were important. The benefits of the research approach in terms of critical reflection, functionally relevant data, within and across case analysis and contextualisation are discussed. As the findings of this series of studies highlight, positive benefits were apparent for each participant and thus it is concluded that group treatment is a viable option for adolescent survivors of CSA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexual abuse</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">program evaluation</field><field name="subject">group treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071010.130124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of formal communication strategies to increase the transfer of information in a human service organisation</field><field name="creator">sharee.hogg@swantafe.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">This body of work constitutes a description of the development and implementation of the Formal Communication Strategy for the Service Purchasing and Development (SPD) directorate of the Disability Services Commission (Commission) in Perth, Western Australia.

- between SPD and other Commission directorates; and

Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to develop the Strategy which included incorporating information obtained from a review of the literature; results of a pre- and post-implementation questionnaire; and the directions outlined by senior management within the SPD directorate.

Very little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms required for pathogenicity of S. nodorum, despite its major impact on Australian agriculture. S. nodorum is a polycyclic pathogen. Rain-splashed pycnidiospores attach to and colonise wheat tissue and subsequently sporulate within 2-3 weeks. Several cycles of infection are needed to build up inoculum for the damaging infection of flag leaves and heads, sporulation is therefore a critical component of the infection cycle of S. nodorum; our aim is to determine the genetic and biochemical requirements for sporulation for development of control of the pathogen. Disease progression of S. nodorum on wheat cv. Amery was monitored by light microscopy to determine the time point when pycnidia development began. Early pycnidia development was evident 12 days post-infection. This information was used to guide a genomics and a metabolomics based approach to determine the requirements for sporulation in S. nodorum. The genomics approach utilised two cDNA libraries created from sporulating and non-sporulating cultures. EST frequency was used to determine highly expressed genes under the two developmental states. Gene expression from the most highly represented genes during sporulation were confirmed using quantitative PCR. A gene encoding an arabitol 4-dehydrogenase (Abd1), was mutagenised, in its absence sporulation was reduced by approximately 20%. The metabolomics approach isolated metabolites from both in planta infection and in vitro growth. Rapid changes in the abundance of metabolites were detected during the onset of sporulation. Key fungal metabolites identified include mannitol and trehalose. The concentration of both mannitol and trehalose increased dramatically in concert with pycnidia formation. Both mannitol and trehalose have also been linked to pathogenicity in filamentous fungi. Creation of deletion mutants of the gene encoding trehalose 6-phosphate synthase showed the synthesis of trehalose is required for full sporulation of S. nodorum in planta and in vitro.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stagonospora nodorum</field><field name="subject">fungi</field><field name="subject">sporulation</field><field name="subject">metabolomics</field><field name="subject">EST</field><field name="subject">necrotroph</field><field name="subject">pathogen</field><field name="subject">trehalose</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071101.221432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of two Components of the Aussie Optimism Program on Social Skills</field><field name="creator">Upstream@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The relationship between social skill deficits and emotional and behavioural problems has led researchers to examine the cognitive and behavioural elements of social skill acquisition in childhood. This research aimed to compare the effectiveness of two components of the Aussie Optimism program for enhancing social behaviour in late childhood.  

One hundred and twenty-eight children (68 boys and 60 girls) aged between 9 and 12 years from two schools participated in the study: (a) 34 students received the social life skills program; (b) 49 students received the optimistic thinking skills program; and (c) 45 students were assigned to a no-treatment control group. 

Children were assessed with self-report and teacher-report measures of social skills, adjustment and explanatory style at pretest, posttest and three months follow-up. In addition, the relationship between these variables at pretest and health-related variables measured throughout the intervention was examined. The results indicated that the social skills program improved the social skills of participating children at posttest. No intervention effects were found for explanatory style. No intervention effects were found for teacher-rated measures of behaviour or adjustment, although in general students improved on these measures over time. Eating breakfast was associated with increased social skills, and better teacher-rated academic performance and adaptive functioning at pretest. Stressful life events were negatively correlated with academic performance and teacher-rated happiness at pretest, and higher exercise levels were associated with less teacher-rated social problems at pretest.
 
This research indicates that the social life skills intervention program improves the social skills of participating children in the short-term. Limitations and implications of the present findings are discussed. Further research is needed to clarify the impact of health-related variables on intervention outcomes for children.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child psychology</field><field name="subject">Social skills in children</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071107.143156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ICTs : empowering Western Australian women?</field><field name="creator">J.Green@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The idea that women are empowered through their learning and use of ICTs (ICTs are defined as computers, the Internet, and e-mail for the purposes of this thesis) has been adopted by international development agencies and the governments of most nations throughout the world. Hence, many agencies and governments have made courses on computers, the Internet, and e-mail available to women with the aim of empowering them.

Empowerment is defined variously and has at its core the social, political, and economic development of women to create equality and challenge patriarchy. Women&#146;s empowerment seeks to bring about societal change that will create conditions and structures that foster and maintain gender equality in all facets of life.

This thesis examines the notion of women&#146;s empowerment through ICTs. The first section of the thesis uses development and empowerment literature to define, explain, and critique women&#146;s empowerment and the conditions under which it is supposed to operate. The second section presents, analyses, and discusses the data collected from a questionnaire answered by some Western Australian women on their experiences of ICTs courses offered by the Western Australian government and their subsequent life changes. The questionnaire was designed to establish whether or not women are empowered to create societal change and challenge patriarchy, as suggested in literature.

The results from the questionnaire show that the majority of the women in the cohort were empowered to the intrapersonal (or micro-) level only. Hence, there was little evidence for the majority of women of the interpersonal (or meso-) level and no evidence of the societal (macro-) level empowerment of the women through ICTs. Therefore, this study does not support the contention that women are empowered through ICTs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology and women</field><field name="subject">ICTs</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071114.114223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'No more head stockman, he's a chairman now' : the making and breaking of the pastoral system in the Kimberley Ranges, 1903-1972</field><field name="creator">Mary Anne Jebb</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Aboriginal pastoral workers' life stories in the context of the two mass movements in Kimberley history: the move toward pastoral stations in the 'early days' of this century and away from them in the 1960s and 1970s. In the northern ranges region of the Kimberley pastoral settlement began in 1903, with a second phase of intense settlement from 1920. The recency of settlement in this region meant that in the late 1980s people were alive who had experienced both 'first contact' and the arrival of 'Welfare'. This study places Aboriginal life story narratives in a wider historical context, drawn from written archives and a range of oral testimonies about the origins and development of the pastoral system in the north and central Kimberley. The broader economic and political context which affected the process of incorporating northern ranges people into the Australian nation is examined through individual contacts and biographies to develop the patterns of alliances with 'Bosses' and the impact of Welfare on those relationships.

In 1971, small reserves on the outskirts of Kimberley towns which catered for 20 to 40 people in the 1950s, held up to 300 residents who were previously living on pastoral stations. The overcrowded and unserviced fringe camps were thought to contain people displaced from station employment by the decision to enforce equal wages for Aborigines in the pastoral industry. It is one of the contentions of this thesis that the social and economic foundations of the old rationing system on most of the stations in the northern Kimberley were crumbling before the award wages decision and its application to the Kimberley in 1969. The 'eviction after award wages' theme underestimates Aboriginal agency in the migration process, fails to take account of their changing social and economic requirements and the pull of Welfare support, glorifies the period of 'settlement' on stations and reinforces the 'myth of the lazy native' which underpinned public debate and Arbitration Commission discussions in the 1960s about the inclusion of Aboriginal workers within the Pastoral Industry Award.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land settlements</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Kimberley</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian stockmen</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071116.140713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective space (looking back)</field><field name="creator">S.Tampalini@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">&#147;You can&#146;t be a rationalist in an irrational world. It isn&#146;t rational&#148; Joe Orton 1

It may be argued that a historically accepted model of an academic career begins with having completed a PhD and in so doing identifying a body of theory that will inform and constitute one&#146;s practical academic work. While it may be an accepted model it does not necessarily take precedence as the only model. The relationship between theory and practice is symbiotic and as such it is possible, and indeed at times desirable, that practice inform theory. It is not advisable to be solely operating from a position of theory when making creative work; the risk is far too great.

The gravitational force of theory can all too easily disturb the &#147;fragile innocence&#148; of creativity. Pulled and constrained by the logic of theory the work risks becoming too didactic and its creativity sacrificed for the sake of rationalism&#133;a symptom almost diagnostic of our culture.

I appreciate that the term &#147;creative&#148; is open to a plethora of readings, each with their own cogent claim to usage. When I employ the term I am referring to a particular type of decision-making process involved in the solution of problems. I will argue that a creative decision differs from other types of decisions [such as, practical or scientific] in the way the resultant solution of the problem remains open to a greater number of potential readings. I will also argue that it is precisely in those heuristic moments of potential impasse, often associated with a problem&#146;s resolution, where creativity hangs out.

In any creative venture, I have always been guided by the importance and significance of doing2&#133;in the doing is the theory. This is not meant to dismiss theory but simply to see it in much the same way as when we see objects in our peripheral vision. Just as objects in our peripheral vision do not take their place in our visual field3, theory [for me] participates in creative processes by subconsciously serving as an early guiding system that helps monitor the work. In this age of information we are no longer innocent of theory -it is ineluctable. What is crucial is that we have a command of theory in order that we may go through it and regain our creative innocence. If we do not, we only achieve an artificial innocence born of enthusiasm, exuberance and imprecision. Creative innocence is re-found in doing. This assertion conceives of theory as participating as part of a creative subconscious and goes someway towards explaining the sudden epiphany of understanding that is frequently associated with prolonged and intense work, or the immense pleasure at retrospectively recognising the theory that seemed to have informed one&#146;s work without being conscious of it -as if the theoretical component had always been there. This phenomenon is of fundamental concern to my thesis, especially when considering the theatre productions that constitute my creative oeuvre. Upon close inspection, my works ultimately reveal that the defining distance between a visceral creative decision [one whose manifestation is immediately felt as apposite] and one that is conceptualised as the illustration of a theory, is not that great&#133;I just happen to begin working outside of the brackets of theoretical narration.

Throughout my thesis I will refer to all visuals as images but I will argue that there are specific types of images, namely signs, symbols and metaphors.

&#147;In language the term &#145;image&#146; can imply more than a verbal description of a purely visual experience; it can also mean the metaphoric, ornamental, rhetorical figurative use of language as opposed to its literal use.&#148; 4

For the surrealists &#147;image&#148; meant more than the representation5 of an external thing in the material world, it also meant the revelation of an internal mental state, a psychological verity occluded from consciousness.

&#147;Images [of this kind] were incandescent flashes linking two elements belonging to categories that are so far removed from each other that reason would fail to connect them and that require a momentary suspension of the critical attitude in order for them to be brought together.&#148; 6

Having already built a body of practical work [spanning thirty years] the challenge was to see if it was possible to identify a coherent theory that consistently functioned as the catalyst of the work - albeit disparate in its nature. The analytical process proved to be the reverse of that which may be observed in the historically accepted model of academic discourse&#133;where the process is cumulative. In this instance the process was deductive -a forensic assignment akin to tracing the diverse creative elements to their creative source or motivation. The venture proved illuminating in much the same way as when one is asked to crystallise a complex theoretical argument; you have to reinvent the argument in a way that helps to simplify its complexity without attenuating its integrity -a complexity that is well known to you but that eludes the uninitiated reader.

Whenever I try and think about my theatre practice I am vexed -particularly when I filter my own experiences and try and extract the meanings that seem genuinely inherent in them. At first glance it is satisfying because of a sense of coherence or pattern in a whole host of discrete events. However a closer inspection quickly reveals the fractal complexity of the pattern and demands a reappraisal of how we see and decipher it. Any attempt to understand its disparate nature by investigating one part in isolation from the whole proves initially unsatisfying and finally futile, for each part seems to be informed by and refer to other parts, as if participating in a greater organising principle; a principle that resists traditional cartography; one that is best seen as one sees the earth from outer space.7 When the earth is seen from outer space one becomes aware of the greater organising principle [the universe] within which it functions. Similarly it is only when the topology of my work is seen from a distance that its coherence is apparent&#133;the further away one is, the more clearly one recognises its constituent parts.

&#147;Despite our desire to lose ourselves in the living depths of a work, we are constrained to distance ourselves from it in order to speak of it. Why, then not deliberately establish a distance that will reveal to us, in a panoramic perspective, the surroundings with which the work is organically linked?&#148; 8

When I am in the middle of a theatre production, I have only the slightest idea of how it will end; I trust in the doing, and at the end I am always surprised by what I have created. Ambiguity and paradox and consequently indeterminacy ultimately emerge as the common features of my work; they appear as sign posts that mark a way of finally mapping it. Each individual piece of work remains coherently intact despite its seemingly obscure coalescence with others, but it is when the works intersect at these points of commonality that one may observe the greater organising matrix.

&#147;The phenomenological world is not a pure being, but the sense which is revealed where the paths of my various experiences intersect, and also where my own and other people&#146;s intersect and engage each other like gears.&#148; 9

Patterns of performance were explored in a sample of genuine traumatic brain injured subjects who were litigating (TBI-LIT; N = 22) and compared to a sample of genuine traumatic brain injured subjects who were not in litigation (TBI-NONLIT; N = 22).
Comparisons were also made to a sample of subjects who were depressed but not neurologically compromised (PSY-DEP; N = 24). Results demonstrated that when time for loss of consciousness was controlled for, no difference existed between the litigating and non-litigating groups on any serial position. With this in mind the TBILIT and TBI NON-LIT groups were collapsed to form one traumatic brain injured group (TBI; N = 44). Patterns of performance were then compared between the TBI group, the PSY-DEP group and a normal control (NC; N = 68) group. No differences were demonstrated between the TBI and PSY-DEP groups on any serial position however, the NC group demonstrated significantly different primacy effects than the TBI group and significantly different recency effects than both the TBI and PSY-DEP groups (Study 1). Patterns of performance relative to the serial position were also compared in a group of Alzheimers Disease (AD; N=20) and dementia(DEM; N=20) subjects. Results indicated that the DEM group demonstrated a greater primacy effect than the AD group with both groups demonstrating a greater recency effect when compared to the primacy effect but no significantly so. Patterns of performance was also explored in a group of Huntington's Disease subjects (HD; =14) with this group demonstrating a significantly reduced primacy effect as compared to a recency effect (Study 2). In the third study patterns of performance were compared in a group of subjects having sustained fiontal lobe (FL; N=21) and
posterior lobe (PL; N=21) lesions to the brain. Subjects with PL lesions demonstrated a signifckntly greater primacy effect as compared to the FL group with both groups demonstrating a reduced recency effect. Comparisons were also made between the PL and FL groups with normal control groups (FL-NC; N = 21: PL-NC; N = 21) and results indicated that the FL group demonstrated a significantly reduced primacy and recency effect when compared to the normal control group. When comparisons were made between the PL and a normal control group, the PL group demonstrated a significantly reduced recency effect as compared to normal controls. Pattern of performance were also explored in a small sample of subjects with diffuse
DIFF; N=6) damage to the brain and results demonstrated that this group displayed a reduced recency effect as compared to the primacy effect (Study 3). Overall, when examining the serial position effects across all experimental groups, subjects who had sustained a traumatic injury to the brain or who were depressed all demonstrated a greater primacy effect as compared to the recency effect by recalling more words on that position. This contrasted the pattern of performance which emerged with various dementing processes where more words were recalled in the recency position as compared to the primacy position.

Part two of my research is concerned with marine education centres and uncovering their stories; documenting their ethos, education and public relations. I aim to focus on what each centre does best and how this has enabled them to become the entity that they are today. Through this process I collect information that will inform the culminating vision of this thesis, the Eco-camp.

Part three is the vision for an Eco-Camp, which has developed organically from my understandings derived from parts one and two. Through both my research on marine education centres and my personal immersion in Millennium Kids Environmental Citizenship program, I began to realize the value and need for an Eco-Camp. The Eco-Camp will be in remote robust healthy nature and will immerse participants in these environments, attuning them to the rhythm of Gaia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Sustainable living</field><field name="subject">Environmental education</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071119.85042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of beak and feather disease virus infection</field><field name="creator">khalesi20022002@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">The circovirus Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) causes psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) that is characterised by a chronic disease process associated with feather abnormalities, beak deformities and eventual death in various species of birds in the order Psittaciformes. This disease is seen in captive and wild psittacine species in Australia and several other countries and is a significant threat to the survival of some endangered psittacine species.

This thesis reports on genetic studies that have furthered the understanding of the diversity of BFDV present within Australia. These studies have optimised methods of detecting BFDV. They have also resulted in the production of an immunogenic and antigenic recombinant BFDV Capsid protein that could lead to alternate methods of producing viral antigen for serological tests and the development of a BFDV vaccine.

To assess the optimal method of the detection of BFDV infection, feather and blood samples were submitted by referring veterinarians throughout Australia from psittacine birds tentatively diagnosed with PBFD or with a history of being in contact with PBFD-affected birds. These samples were examined by 3 procedures commonly used to detect BFDV infection: a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and haemagglutination (HA) for the detection of virus, and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests for the detection of virus antibody in response to infection. Of the samples examined from 623 psittacine birds, the prevalence of BFDV DNA in feather samples detected by PCR was 18.85%. There was a strong correlation between PCR and HA testing of feather samples, although possible false-positive and false-negative PCR and HA results were obtained in some samples. Of the 143 birds that were PCR feather-positive only 2 had detectable HI antibody and these birds were also HA feather-negative, which suggests that they were developing immunity to recent infection. All birds with HI antibody were feather HA negative.

Despite the rare occurrence of PBFD in cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus), 2 of the 13 samples collected from this species were PCR and HA positive indicating that this species can be infected with BFDV.

Three studies were undertaken to further our understanding of the genetics of BFDV in Australian avifauna: sequence analysis of the BFDV detected in a grey cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus), a species normally considered resistant to infection with BFDV; analysis of the genome of BFDV present in lorikeets (Trichoglossus sp.) in Australia; and analysis of the genome of BFDV detected in endangered swift parrots (Lathamus discolor). Sequence analysis of the entire genome of the cockatiel BFDV isolate revealed that it clustered phylogenetically with 2 other viruses, one from a sulphur crested cockatoo (SCC1-AUS) and one from a Major Mitchell cockatoo (MMC-AUS), which suggests that this isolate from the grey cockatiel was not a cockatiel-specific biotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF V1 of BFDV detected in 7 lorikeets demonstrated these 7 isolates clustered phylogenetically with other BFDV isolates obtained from Loriidae species elsewhere in the world and confirmed the presence of a loriid-specific genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data generated from ORF V1 of virus detected in 2 endangered swift parrots provided evidence they were also infected with BFDV genotypes derived from other species of birds, one isolate clustering with viruses from a Loriidae genotype and the other with isolates derived from species of Cacatuidae and Psittacidae.

As part of this research, a baculovirus expression system was successfully developed for the production of recombinant BFDV Capsid protein. Inoculation of this protein into chickens resulted in the development of HI antibody, which demonstrated its immunogenicity. When used as an antigen in HI tests it detected antibody in virus-infected birds, which demonstrated its antigenicity. This protein offers potential application as an antigen for the development of serological tests and as an immunogen for incorporation into vaccines for control of PBFD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Feather disease</field><field name="subject">Parrots</field><field name="subject">Virus diseases</field><field name="subject">Circovirus Beak</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071119.90905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of recombinant vaccines against Jembrana disease</field><field name="creator">w.ditcham@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus causing an acute infection with a 17% case fatality rate in Bali cattle in Indonesia. Control of the disease is currently achieved by identification of infected areas and restriction of cattle movement. A detergent-inactivated whole virus tissue-derived vaccine is sometimes employed in affected areas. 

This thesis reports initial attempts to produce genetically engineered vaccines to replace the inactivated tissue-derived vaccine, which as it is made from homogenised spleen of infected animals, is expensive to produce and could contain adventitious agents present in the donor animals. 

4 potential DNA vaccine constructs were created containing the JDV genes coding for the Tat, capsid (CA), transmembrane (TM) and surface unit (SU) proteins in a commercially available vaccine plasmid. These were assessed for functionality in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. All proteins were expressed in vitro and administration of 2 of the constructs by a commercial &#145;gene gun&#146; into the epidermis of mice resulted in antibody production to the appropriate protein. Due to the difficulties of licensing such a DNA vaccine in Indonesia, these vaccines were not progressed further.

A mathematical model was developed to describe the progression of the acute phase of Jembrana disease following experimental infection with JDV. The model divided the disease into 6 phases based on the rates of viral replication and clearance calculated from data on sequential plasma viral RNA load detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. This allowed statistical comparison of each phase of the disease and comparison of the severity of the disease process in groups of animals. The use of the model overcame the difficulty of comparing the disease in different animals as a consequence of the animal-to-animal variation in the disease process. 

The mathematical model was used to identify differences in the pathogenicity of 2 strains of JDV. One strain, JDVTAB caused a more rapid onset of disease in non-vaccinated controls, a significantly higher virus load at the onset of the febrile period and a higher peak viraemia than in animals infected with JDVPUL. This provided the first evidence of variation in pathogenicity of JDV strains.

The measurement of virus load also demonstrated that some JDV infected animals developed a clinical disease that was not typical of that which had been reported previously. When infected with less than 1,000 infectious virus particles, up to 20% of infected animals failed to develop a febrile response. Infection of these animals was confirmed, however, by the detection of a high titre of circulating virus particles in plasma. These atypical infections had not been reported previously.

Application of the mathematical model describing the progression of the disease in individual animals was used to examine the effect of vaccination with the inactivated tissue-derived vaccine on the progression of the disease. Several effects were noted in vaccinated animals that were subsequently infected with JDV: a reduction in the duration of the febrile response, a reduction in the severity of the febrile response in the early phases of the acute disease, and a reduction in virus load in the early and later phases of the disease process. 

The effect of vaccination with recombinant Tat, matrix (MA) and CA protein vaccines expressed in a bacterial expression system on subsequent JDV infection was also examined. A vaccine incorporating recombinant Tat and CA vaccine emulsified with Freund&#146;s incomplete adjuvant decreased the febrile response particularly in the later stages of the acute disease process, decreased the severity of the leucopenia in the later phases of the acute disease, and decreased the virus load in some but not all phases of the acute disease process. Vaccines administered with Freund&#146;s incomplete adjuvant were more efficacious than vaccines administered with QuilA, the latter actually exacerbating the disease process in vaccinated animals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lentiviruses</field><field name="subject">Cattle Diseases</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071119.94111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reviving Spirit in Corporate systems</field><field name="creator">skrempl@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The underlying context of this work is the mismatch between the systems that we need to comply with and what our spirit and intuition wants and needs. The thesis questions the relevance of spiritless corporate systems set up to serve the &#145;best interest&#146; of human beings and other living things. Corporate systems have been established to comply with governing laws, to facilitate transaction of money and provide financial accountability to stakeholders and clients &#150; spiritless matters. Corporate systems are ill equipped to protect our emotional and spiritual boundaries, our tangible and intangible links to the past and to the future. Spirit, which is the essence of life, is often not understood, discussed or included in the planning, development and implementation of the very systems that govern and impact on our lives and our communities. If spirit is included it is often well intended but rhetorical. Spirit needs to be revived and provided time, place and purpose, not only in our broader lives but also in our work cultures. Without spirit, facts have no meaning or relevance to life.

This thesis searches for solutions to fill this spiritual gap in corporate systems, drawing on the experiences and lessons gained through engaging with communities and corporate systems in Australian and international contexts. The search covers a study of oral tradition(spirit),the impact of the lack of credibility afforded to oral tradition, developing and trialling common-ground terminology and frameworks befitting both corporate and spiritual systems across different industry sectors, the isolation of arts and culture from other sectors, the role of community development arts practices, and aspects of social science and urban development theories.

The research traces the development and implementation of a cultural planning program for Western Australia through policy development at State government level and then framework development undertaken through Community Arts Network WA. The development of this cultural planning program draws on the contribution of diverse industry sector partners and this thesis research explains how their perspectives can contribute to the revival of spirit in corporate systems. The partnerships involved are business planning, town planning, community psychology, vocation, education and training, and sustainability.

Having contributed to the development of the broader frameworks for the implementation of cultural planning across the State and beyond, this research delves further into addressing the issue of reviving spirit in corporate systems through refining the First (spirit) and Third Person (corporate) approach to cultural planning. This method is based on a key Spirit Catalyst called The First and Third Person Systems. This key Spirit Catalyst provides a guide for balance between spirit and corporate systems. There are a total of seven secondary Spirit Catalysts cited. Comparisons and contrasts between First and Third Person cultural planning process and strategic planning are provided. Principles and protocols and tools for evaluating spirit have been developed as part of the process. In keeping with the first person nature of spirit, personal narrative is used wherever possible to give life and meaning to facts and other planning and management processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural planning</field><field name="subject">community engagement</field><field name="subject">spirit</field><field name="subject">corporate systems</field><field name="subject">cultural mapping</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">story</field><field name="subject">community culture</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071126.110753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of signal transduction in the pathogenicity of Stagonospora nodorum on wheat</field><field name="creator">Karchun.tan@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">The fungus Stagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of leaf and glume blotch
disease on wheat and is an emerging model for the study of the interaction between
plants and necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Signal transduction plays a critical role
during infection by allowing the pathogen to sense and appropriately respond to
environmental changes. The role of signal transduction in the pathogenicity of S.
nodorum was analysed by the targeted inactivation of genes encoding a G&#225; subunit
(Gna1) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mak2). Strains carrying the inactivated
genes were impaired in virulence and demonstrated a host of phenotypic impairments
such as abolished sporulation. Therefore, it was hypothesised that Gna1 and Mak2
regulate downstream effector molecules that are critical for pathogenic development. A
2D gel-based proteomic approach was used to compare the extracellular and
intracellular proteomes of the wild-type fungus and signalling mutants for differences in
protein abundance. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and patternmatching
against the S. nodorum genome sequence led to the identification of 26 genes
from 34 differentially abundant protein spots. These genes possess probable roles in
protein cycling, plant cell wall degradation, stress response, nucleotide metabolism,
proteolysis, quinate and secondary metabolism. A putative short-chain dehydrogenase
gene (Sch1) was identified and its expression was shown to be reduced in both
signalling mutants. The transcript level of Sch1 increased during the latter period of
infection coinciding with pycnidiation. Sch1 was inactivated by targeted gene deletion.
Mutants were able to effectively colonise the host but asexual sporulation was
dramatically reduced and pycnidial ontogeny was severely disrupted. Furthermore, the
sch1 mutants showed alterations in the metabolome. GC-MS analysis identified a
metabolite which accumulated in the sch1 mutants. Computational and database
analyses indicated that the compound possesses a cyclic carbon backbone. Based on
these findings, Sch1 may be a suitable target for fungicides that inhibit asexual
sporulation and the accumulated compound may be used to design novel antifungal
compounds. 2D SDS-PAGE analysis identified increased abundance of another
putative short-chain dehydrogenase (Sch2) and a nitroreductase in the sch1-deleted
background. It was also shown that Sch2 was regulated by Gna1.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fungus signal transduction proteomic</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071126.130813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine phytoplankton primary production and ecophysiology using chlorophyll-A fluorescence</field><field name="creator">jcos@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Marine phytoplankton ecophysiological state and primary production measurements have typically been controversial due to potential impacts of measurement techniques. Advances in chl-a fluorescence techniques have provided a means for rapid, non-invasive measurement of electron transport through photosystem 2 (PSII) in dilute phytoplankton suspensions. While studies on higher plants have outlined a close relationship between PSII electron transport and carbon fixation, results from studies on microalgae reveal significant variations in the relationship.

Three species of phytoplankton representing three major taxonomic groups of the marine phytoplankton were used in this study: (1) Chaetoceros muelleri CS176 Lemmermann (Bacillariophyta), (2) Isochrysis galbana CS177 Parke (Haptophyta) and, (3) Nannochloropsis oculata CS179 (Droop) Hibberd (Ochrophyta, eustigmatophyte). Each species was cultured in semicontinuous culture and primary
production was estimated using oxygen evolution and carbon fixation techniques and compared against predictions based on chl-a fluorescence measurements. It was found that predicted values of primary production both under-estimated and overestimated actual carbon fixation measured via radioisotope (14C) techniques. This variation was primarily explained by probable errors in the assumed values for PSII density. The relationship between oxygen evolution or carbon fixation with chl-a fluorescence-derived measures was commonly linear below the light saturation parameter, with a departure from linearity occurring at higher irradiances. This departure from linearity was greatest in cultures adapted to low light conditions. At higher light intensities alternative electron pathways such as the Mehler reaction and/or chlororespiration are likely to be more active in low light-adapted cultures, leading to this greater non-linearity.

Chl-a fluorescence measurements were also found to be a useful in characterising ecophysiology using photosynthesis-versus irradiance curves. However, an important caveat on this is the measurement of PSII density (&#231;PSII) rather than use of an assumed value as changes in &#231;PSII can have a profound impact on light curve parameters.

A field study in Fremantle Harbour found a healthy (negligible nutrient starvation), diatom dominated, phytoplankton community. Results suggest that phytoplankton are able to begin boosting photosynthetic capability just prior to morning twilight. Waters in the harbour were well mixed via tidal motion and substantial midday photoinhibition was not observed. Data suggest levels of primary production at the mouth of the harbour are similar to those of coastal waters in the plume of the Ocean Reef wastewater outfall.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chlorophyll-a</field><field name="subject">fluorsecence</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071129.122222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reflective analysis of a transformative pedagogical approach at a rural Thai University</field><field name="creator">elwrush@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Mass culture in Thailand creates idealizations about female beauty which cause many women to engage in destructive behavior such as starvation dieting and forced vomiting. In this dissertation I describe efforts to develop awareness among a group of predominately female students at a rural Thai university about the ideological purposes of these idealizations. Using a CD-based multimedia research template, the students reported the &#147;common sense&#148; beliefs which help create the beauty ideal and the effects of these beliefs on their own lives and the lives of other women. The major finding of their research was that mass culture creates beauty ideologies to maintain social stratification, in that those women who are made to feel &#147;ugly&#148; because they do not resemble the white-skinned underweight ideal tend not to be members of the elite social class which has the resources and time to achieve these ideals. The significance of this dissertation lies in the emancipatory effects that it produced; although a Critical Discourse Analysis showed that the students continued to assimilate some of the values and interests which they had identified as &#147;oppressive&#148;, they also demonstrated to varying degrees that they had ceased to think and behave in ways which had caused them mental and physical damage in the past.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Hegemony</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071129.122953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire and the persistence of tuart woodlands</field><field name="creator">R.Archibald@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Tall tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) trees are a defining element of the landscape of Perth and the coastal plain to the north and south. However, with the health of some tuart stands deteriorating, most notably at Yalgorup south of Perth, concerns are heightening that the already fragmented tuart ecosystem will continue to contract, leaving a cultural and ecological scar in the landscape. Like many other eucalypt ecosystems, tuart woodlands have had a long association with fire and are believed to have been frequently burnt by the Aborigines prior to European settlement. Today, fragmentation and European land management practices have led to a lower frequency of fire across most remaining woodlands, but also episodes of intense fire at shorter intervals in some areas. Individual fire events as well as fire regimes have the potential to shape the structure, composition and extent of ecosystems, and eucalypt ecosystems are no different. Thus, the impact of fire and fire regimes on tuart health and regeneration was investigated in this study.

A survey of the woodlands at Yalgorup revealed tuart decline was present across a range of sites with contrasting fire histories. Tuart health was poorest at the longest unburnt site (35 years) and the site burnt by frequent wildfire (three fires in 13 years), suggesting these extreme fire regimes had played a role in the decline. Nevertheless, low ratings of tree health at sites burnt approximately once per decade, point to factors other than fire playing a role in the decline of tuart at Yalgorup. The tuart populations at Yalgorup were dominated by individuals in larger size-classes and there was a significant negative relationship between tree size and the probability of tree mortality. In one stand in Yalgorup National Park, 38 % of the tuart saplings/trees had died. It follows that the regeneration and development of tuart seedlings into adults will need to occur within the next one to two decades if these woodlands are to persist. Seedling counts confirmed that tuart regeneration was virtually absent in unburnt areas, as is common with eucalypt species. Interpretations of size-class distributions suggested controlled burning contributed little to recruitment, whereas in areas subject to wildfire outside Yalgorup, tuart had regenerated in abundance such that size-class distributions were skewed towards the smaller size-classes. A repeat survey of plots established in 1976 supported anecdotal reports that the mid-storey tree peppermint (Agonis flexuosa) was increasing in density and height in Yalgorup. The skew towards the smallest size-class within peppermint populations at Yalgorup and the presence of seedlings ( &gt; 200 seedlings ha-1) within areas not recently burnt (at least four years since fire) brought into focus the differing mode of regeneration for this species in comparison to tuart. In further contrast to tuart, mature peppermints were in good health with no dead trees reported in the population surveys. A possible role for competition in tuart decline was highlighted by significant negative correlation between peppermint density and tuart health. Together, these results suggest that a general drift from tuart woodland to peppermint forest appears entrenched.

Comparative studies of the bark thickness, fire response and resprouting behaviour of tuart and peppermint illustrated the capacity of individuals of both species to persist with recurrent fire. As adults or juveniles, tuart and peppermint resprouted following complete canopy scorch, and often from crown branches: an ability not uncommon for co-occurring tree species and shrubs in this environment. Survival was between 75 and 100 % for fully-scorched tuarts in size-classes ranging from small saplings to trees across six sites. From the small sample of peppermints available for comparison, seedlings and small saplings appeared to be more vulnerable to mortality by fire; only 45 % of individuals with a diameter at breast height &#161;&#220; 1 cm survived following complete canopy scorch from a controlled burn. With thicker bark, a reliance on stem epicormic buds rather than a lignotuber for resprouting and a greater capacity for height growth, the fire resistance and post-fire recovery of tuart would be expected to differ from that for peppermint. Opportunities for managers to exploit these differences in their burning prescriptions so as to address the drift from tuart to peppermint dominance were outlined. In addition, results indicating a positive response in canopy condition for tuarts with &lt; 10 % canopy scorch following a controlled burn imply that tuart vigour may benefit more immediately from fire. But, observations also revealed that spikes in intensity within controlled burns can damage large unhealthy trees and thereby accelerate the decline process. Thus, the application of fire to declining tuart stands needs to be conducted skillfully.

Patterns of growth and survival for tuart and peppermint seedlings were linked to the contrasting ability of the species to establish at burnt and unburnt sites. The purported importance of ashbeds in tuart establishment was demonstrated; at the end of summer (February) at a recently burnt site (Golden Bay), the mean height of tuart seedlings on ashbeds was three times that for those off ashbeds, and the survival rate on and off the ashbeds was 35 % and 15 %, respectively. Therefore, while important, tuart seedlings were not dependent on ashbeds in this instance. The hardy nature of peppermint seedlings when compared to tuart was illustrated when the species were planted in an unburnt area of tuart-peppermint woodland at Yalgorup; nine months after planting, 38 % of the peppermint seedlings survived while only 9 % of the tuart survived. Most of the mortality was linked with the summer-drought period and it was suspected that peppermint seedlings were more drought tolerant. A complementary glasshouse experiment showed that tuart had a greater shoot:root ratio than peppermint, which may be one factor in the greater sensitivity of this species to drought. Further, this experiment revealed that with an increase in nutrient supply, the proportional increment in rooting depth for tuart (1.6 times) was significantly greater than for peppermint (0.3 times). An increased availability of nutrients in ashbeds following fire, particularly for phosphorous, was measured within tuart woodland. Therefore, it was inferred that the availability of nutrients was a critical factor increasing the growth, rooting depth and consequently the greater survival of tuarts on ashbeds. Overall, tuart was concluded to share the Competitor strategy (after Grime) in common with many other eucalypts: rapid growth and the attainment of a large size. On the other hand, peppermint exhibits some of the traits of the Stress Tolerator strategy (after Grime): low minimum resource requirements for growth and survival.

The consequence of the increasing cover of peppermint on tuart establishment was explored in field experiments with planted tuart seedlings. No significant impact on seedling growth or survival was observed. There was a declining trend in the seedling growth rates under the high compared to the low peppermint density treatments as the second summer of the experiment was approached, although a statistical difference could not be shown. Peppermint density also had no significant influence on damage to the seedlings from insect attack or the foliar pathogen Mycosphaerella cryptica. Overall, insects and M. cryptica had only an incidental impact on the seedlings: the mean level of canopy damage per affected seedling was &lt; 10 % for either of these two damage agents. Soil type, specifically whether growth occurred on an ashbed was demonstrated to be the most important factor in tuart growth and survival in the 18 months following planting. Although survival was superior on ashbeds (88 %), mean survival was &gt; 50 % in unburnt soil 18 months after planting indicating the potential for restorative plantings to occur in some woodlands between fires.

Tuart decline, and the role of altered fire regimes in the decline is complex and further avenues of research were emphasized. Nevertheless, the findings of this and other studies are sufficient to enable purposeful actions to conserve and restore tuart woodlands; recommendations regarding the application of fire with a view to these goals are presented in the final discussion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus gomphocephala</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">Agonis flexuosa</field><field name="subject">Yalgorup</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071130.140115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The free trade doctrine, regionalism, the asean free trade area and their effects on trade and trade policy</field><field name="creator">A.ariffin@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a number of issues concerning the free trade doctrine, regionalism and Regional Free Trade Areas (FTAs), with a special focus on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). This study is broadly divided into three parts. The first part examines the doctrine of free trade from the perspectives of ideological belief as well as theoretical expositions, and how these influence trade policies of many countries throughout the history of trade. The second part of the study analyses the forces that influence the formation of regionalism and regional FTAs all over the world. In the first and second parts, an extensive survey of the existing literature is undertaken to unearth relevant ideas and events, which are important to policy makers and the general public. 

	The third part of the study deals primarily with empirical investigation of the economic effects brought about by the formation of regional FTAs. Two main issues are examined in this part. The first issue is the assessment of the effects that regional FTAs have on trade of members against other countries that do not become members of any economic groupings. The second issue is the examination of the effect of AFTA on trade of member vis-&#224;-vis non-member countries. In addition, this part also examines the question of whether AFTA &#147;creates&#148; or &#147;diverts&#148; trade. For the purpose of addressing issues grouped in this part of the study, a gravity model is employed to answer the questions of interest. This part of the study covers a period of 24 years (1980-2003). Cross sectional data involving 990 pairs of countries, which trade with each other, are used in regression analysis based on the Ordinary Least Square technique. 

	Findings from the first and second parts of the study indicate that trade between countries during the era of mercantilism (1500s-1750s) was carried out under enormous restrictions in consonance with the thinking of that time. However, by the end of eighteenth century the economic arguments in favour of free trade began to be accepted, resulting in the adoption of the free trade idea into the commercial policies of many countries, particularly in Europe in the middle of nineteenth century. The period characterized by unilateral free trade regimes lasted only about three decades, as protectionist elements made a return into trade policy formulation in the 1870s. The period of liberal trade policy regimes came to a complete end at the breakout of the First World War in 1914, and the protectionist trade policies of many countries continued to strengthen their grip until the Second World War.
	
After WW2 ended in 1945, many countries realised that security and the orderly conduct of international trade were important to ensure continuous prosperity of the world. This led to series of negotiations involving major trading countries that resulted in the establishment of the GATT in 1947. The main thrust behind this initiative was that all trading nations must cooperate to liberalize their trade policies, reflecting the idea that countries should move towards adopting &#147;freer&#148; trade policy than the regime they adopted in the 1930s and the early 1940s.   

At the end of 1990s the world once again observed agreement amongst prominent trade economists for the case of pursuing free trade policy. This is due to the renewed recognition by economists of two important propositions: (1) if market failures remain unfixed, then pursing free trade policy can harm rather that help, and (2) if market failures are fixed through suitable policy interventions, then free trade can be used to exploit the potential gains from trade. Within the second proposition, economists emphasis that if market failures arise in domestic markets, then the most appropriate policy interventions would be to devise policies targeting at correcting those domestic market failures, while free trade is maintained externally.

Findings from empirical assessment of the effects of regional FTAs on trade indicate that economic theory might be able to approximate reality. One important result of this part of the study suggests that three regional FTAs, AFTA, CER and MERCUSOR have had an intra-bloc trade intensifying effect in recent years, particularly since the early 2000s. This implies that trade among members of these economic groupings is higher than their trade with other countries. Meanwhile, the EU and NAFTA do not show an intra-bloc trade intensifying effect for any part of the study period. The other important result obtained by this study suggests that although AFTA member countries trade with each other, comparatively, more than their trade with the rest of the world, the intensity of trade between them is less pronounced for the period after the formation of AFTA. This implies that AFTA has the characteristic of an &#147;open trading bloc&#148;. Lastly, the finding of this part of the study also suggests that AFTA essentially creates rather than diverts trade.

In contrast to these opinions, this study shows that the genealogical section of the Chronicler's work is an ordered, well structured, unified whole. The Chronicler presents his genealogies chiastically, with the central focus of the chiasm upon the proper cultic officials, performing the proper cultic duties, in the proper cultic place.

Each of the supporting levels of the chiasm build to this climax by declaring the inability of kings and armies to maintain the people within their land. The genealogies indicate that, in spite of the best efforts of leaders or people, society is sent into exile because of the unfaithfulness of the people and their leaders.

The genealogies also declare the way out of exile. Humility and prayer are shown to bring blessing, prosperity and land, while periods of mourning over unfaithful behaviour results in the blessings of children and the building of cities. In the centre of it all is the cult. The cult is the means by which atonement is made for past acts of unfaithfulness, and without the cult, atonement for unfaithfulness is impossible.

The genealogies indicate that the cult must be at the centre of the lives of the people. It cannot be neglected, but must be fully maintained and supported. Each of the cultic guilds must be present for the cult to function properly. Each guild must perform its function, and must do so in the place authorised by Yahweh. Only then can atonement for the people be made, and only then can the people possess their land.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronicles</field><field name="subject">geneology</field><field name="subject">chasm</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071130.143208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting up close and textual: An interpretive study of feedback practice and social relations in doctoral supervision</field><field name="creator">S.Knowles@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The privatised interactions between doctoral student and supervisor as they jointly work on the text are the subject of my thesis. To investigate this important yet neglected aspect of supervision, I use data obtained from interviews with seven doctoral supervisory pairs in the social sciences, arts, and humanities in an Australian university. My methodology comprises a series of close-ups to explore feedback relations within supervision and the ways in which meanings are played out for both supervisors and students. The interpretive approach draws upon Foucaultian theory, critical discourse analysis, and (post)critical theory traditions. Accordingly, the power asymmetries between supervisor and student are seen as productive &#150; in the sense of creatively fertile - and not merely synonymous with prohibition or disempowerment. Within five interpretive chapters, I engage with the productive and problematic aspects of supervisory relations, making visible how supervisory feedback assists in the formation of students&#146; scholarly identities. My analysis examines how the pressures to ensure the production of timely and disciplined thesis texts are impacting on feedback relations. It also examines various ambiguities and tensions such as those embedded in the supervisor&#146;s position as &#145;pastor&#146; and &#145;critic&#146;, between asymmetrical and relational power, between the promotion of authorship/autonomy on the one hand, and the preservation of the canon on the other. My discussion highlights the ways supervisors, notwithstanding their authority, attempt to mediate the power disparity through mechanisms such as standing back, withholding and filtering feedback, or using the invitational strategies of &#145;under offering&#146; which downplay the disciplinary nature of their work. I also reflect on what makes acceptance or resistance more or less likely and what promotes/hinders the transition to and reliance on students&#146; own expertise. Overall, the interpretations I offer suggest that the exercise of power is never straightforward, is opaque and ambiguous and susceptible to misunderstanding and unpredictability. My research thus reveals a picture of social relations that is less orderly and transparent than assumed in the institutional literature and associated guidelines. In particular, the research qualifies the current institutional faith that PhD research/writing is a transparent process, within which supervisors can be trained in the &#145;skills&#146; for providing effective feedback so students can work at an efficient pace and produce predictable results.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">supervisory feedback</field><field name="subject">doctoral supervision</field><field name="subject">power relations</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071204.85056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and Characterization of Rickettsiae in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">h.owen@uq.edu.au</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to address the shortfall in current, in-depth knowledge of Western Australian rickettsiae investigating in particular, the role of native and feral animals as reservoir hosts.  Two novel species of rickettsiae were detected in ticks collected from native and feral animals and humans, these were characterised using molecular methods.  A preliminary investigation into the pathogenic potential of one of the isolates was also undertaken.

To facilitate investigation, ectoparasites (principally ticks) were opportunistically collected from across the State, with an emphasis on native and feral animals and people. All ectoparasites were screened for rickettsial infection using a polymerase chain reaction incorporating Rickettsia-specific citrate synthase gene (gltA) primers. Preliminary sequencing was performed on representative PCR-positive samples from each geographical location, vertebrate host and ectoparasite in order to identify and characterize the infecting rickettsia. Isolation in cell culture and further genotypic characterization was then performed. Finally, a serosurvey and questionnaire were implemented in one of the study areas to determine whether people were being infected with a Rickettsia spp. and whether infection was associated with clinical signs. 

Ectoparasite collection produced three genera of ticks (Ixodes, Amblyomma and Haemaphysalis) from native animals, feral pigs and people, primarily from the southwest of Western Australia and Barrow Island in the Pilbara region. Ticks from a number of sources were shown to be infected with rickettsiae by the PCR, including feral pigs, people, bobtail lizards, kangaroos, bandicoots, burrowing bettongs, common brushtail possums and yellow-footed antechinus. Genotypic characterization of positive amplicons from ticks revealed the presence of two novel spotted fever group rickettsiae. Rickettsia gravesii sp. nov., named in honour of Dr Stephen Graves, was identified extensively throughout the southwest of the State and on Barrow Island in Ixodes, Amblyomma and Haemaphysalis spp. ticks from multiple hosts. Candidatus &#147;Rickettsia antechini&#148; was detected in Ixodes spp. only from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup.  In addition, a novel Bartonella spp. (Bartonella sp. strain Mu1) was also detected from Acanthopsylla jordani fleas collected from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup.
 
Rickettsia gravesii sp. nov. is most closely related to the Rickettsia massiliae subgroup of the spotted fever group and to R. rhipicephali in particular.  Sequence similarities between this novel species and the subgroup were 99.7%, 98.4%, 95.8% and 97.4% based on its 16S rRNA, gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively. 

Candidatus &#147;Rickettsia antechini&#148; also demonstrated a close relationship to the R. massiliae subgroup (99.4%, 94.8% and 97.1% sequence similarity based on its gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively). The two novel Western Australian species demonstrated 98.4%, 96.3% and 96.7% sequence similarity to each other based on gltA, ompA and ompB genes respectively indicating separate species. The novel Bartonella spp. (Bartonella sp. strain Mu1) detected in fleas collected from yellow-footed antechinus in Dwellingup demonstrated greatest gltA gene sequence similarity to Bartonella strain 40 at 86.1%.

Results from the serosurvey and questionnaire-based investigation into the zoonotic importance of R. gravesii sp. nov. on Barrow Island supported the results of the tick study and suggested that a tick-borne rickettsia(e) was infecting people on the island. However, a significant association between seroconversion and a history of symptoms consistent with a rickettsiosis was not found, and it is possible therefore, that R. gravesii sp. nov. produces only asymptomatic infections.

Future work on rickettsiae in Western Australia will involve phenotypic characterization of the novel species, further investigation of their epidemiology and pathogenicity and an ongoing search for additional undiscovered species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rickettsia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">wildlife</field><field name="subject">Rickettsia gravesii sp. nov.</field><field name="subject">Candidatus &#147;Rickettsia antechini&#148;</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071204.92921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acculturation Differences in Family Units from Former Yugoslavia</field><field name="creator">29948291@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Focus of on-going cross-cultural investigation has throughout the time shown that inadequate language skills paired with absence of knowledge of cultural practices and norms within the receiving society would create a number of  stress behaviors among immigrants, often manifested as lowered mental health status- depression, anxiety, confusion; feelings of marginality and alienation; psychosomatic symptoms and identity confusion (Berry and Annis, 1988; Greenberg &amp; Greenberg, 1989; Kessler, Turner and House, 1988; Shams and Jackson, 1994; Vega et al., 1986; Vinokur, Price and Caplan, 1991; Winefield, Winefield, Tiggermann and Goldney, 1991). It was further noticed that refugee populations across the world are adapting to the receiving societies in a much slower rate then other migrating groups (Greenberg &amp; Greenberg, 1989), and yet due to sensibilities surrounding research of a refugee population, there are still questions surrounding this process. In addition, it appears that the attempts to demystify acculturation and uncover objective underpinnings of it, has further reduced the current concept undermining validity and reliability of the findings. Therefore need for subjective experience and definition of acculturation, as well as reconsideration of complexity of the phenomenon (acculturation) was recognised by this research.

This study was designed to offer a qualitative insight into the acculturative differences within a family unit among refugees from former Yugoslavia. 21 women, recent refugee- arrivals were requested to participate in the open- end interview. In the semi- structured interview the women were asked to give a detailed account of their personal, their partners&#146; and their children&#146;s experiences concerning the emotional, social, economical, occupational and psychological aspects of their and their family- members&#146; acculturation processes. The obtained data was analysed through the means of narrative and Erickson&#146;s analytic induction. The results showed that cultural incompatibilities have spread into diverse spheres of living, thus complexity of the acculturation-related problems was acknowledged. The results showed that (1) split families (due to immigration), (2) inability to establish new social ties in the novel environment and (3) decay in professional status were often reported in connection with eroded physical and mental well-being of the participants and their families. The research also looked at cultural diversities, and gender differences, concentrating on concepts of resilience and coping strategies within the acculturative practice. It appears that cognitive restructuring and the ability to &#147;let go&#148; of the previous lives was the best coping mechanism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yugoslavia</field><field name="subject">acculturative differences</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071211.100224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of women in Femina : an Indonesian women's magazine</field><field name="creator">Suzy Azeharie</field><field name="description">Since the advent of the women's movement, the mass media and literary classics
have become targets for intensive scrutiny by some feminists who are concerned
with the role and influence the media and literature play in promoting a gendered
society. This thesis, focuses mainly on representations of Indonesian women as
presented by the Jakarta-based women's magazine, femina. By analysing six articles
that appeared in the magazine from the 1970s to the 1990s, representations of gender
relationships have been highlighted.

Shaped dominantly by Islamic beliefs, and the Javanese values, which consist
of a syncretic blend of Animist, Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic beliefs, contemporary
Indonesian society is dominated by a strong political state and patriarchal value
system which downgrades women. Resulting from the political changes introduced
by the New Order, there has been a pivotal transformation of Indonesian women's
organisations. The regime strongly encourages wives' organisations, despite the full
equality guaranteed to men and women by the 1945 Constitution. It is demanded of
Indonesian women that their foremost duties are their motherly and wifely roles.
The influence of the priyayi, the Javanese elite, who believe that woman's destiny is
primarily centred on her role as wife and mother, is partially responsible for the
continuing influence of this ideal and the way it subordinates women to men. The
religious traditions are also not without considerable influence in this area. These
values can be found in the articles examined. Further, the thesis investigates
attitudes to women who work outside the home, the double burden that they carry,
and any changes in the representations of women and gender relations over the
twenty years as revealed infemina.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Femina</field><field name="subject">Women in mass media Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Women in popular culture Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Women Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071212.113330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of two chitinase and one novel glucanase genes for engineering plant defence against fungal pathogens</field><field name="creator">s.averis@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinases and glucanases are implicated in plant defense responses against fungal pathogens. These enzymes are responsible for the breakdown of chitin and glucan, two major components of the fungal cell walls. Genes encoding these enzymes have been used to genetically engineer plants to enhance their protection against fungal pathogens.

Western Australia has over 4000 endemic plant species and a largely unknown fungal biota. Given that fungi possessing chitinases and glucanases with novel activities have been isolated in other parts of the world, we propose that fungi from Western Australian soils may possess novel biochemical/enzymatic activities.

The aims of this research project were to isolate chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungi from soil and to clone the genes encoding for chitinase and glucanase enzymes. To achieve these aims, fungi with activity against chitin and glucan were isolated, the activity quantified by colorimetric and inhibition assays and gene fragments with homology to known chitinase and glucanase genes were isolated and their sequences determined.

Soil fungi were isolated from five locations in and around the Perth Metropolitan area of Western Australia with the use of a medium containing Rose Bengal that eliminates all actinomycetes and most bacteria and reduces the growth of fast growing mold colonies.

Forty-one isolates were obtained by this method. Twenty four chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungal isolates were identified by growing them on chitin-containing media to select for those species that utilised chitin/glucan as a carbon source. These were assayed for production of exo- and endochitinolytic and glucanolytic enzymes.

Enzyme activity was compared between crude and dialysed supernatants. Exochitinase activity was determined in the supernatants of 4-day old fungal cultures by the release of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-&#226;-D glucosaminide. The supernatants were measured for endochitinase activity determined by the reduction of turbidity of suspensions of colloidal chitin. Glucanase activity was determined by release of reducing sugar (glucose) from laminarin. Supernatants from eleven of the twenty four isolates showed significant levels of enzyme activity.

Eleven isolates were assayed for activity against purified cell walls of phytopathogenic fungi. Activity was determined by measuring reducing sugars in the fungal supernatants against cell wall preparations of six economically important plant pathogens.

Chitinolytic activity was detected in seven isolates against cell wall preparations of Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani, in four isolates against Fusarium solani and Sclerotinia sclerotium; in five isolates against Ascochyta faba and in six isolates against Leptosphaeria maculans. Similarly glucanolytic activity was detected in eight isolates against B. cinerea, in seven against R. solani, in two against F. solani, in three against S. sclerotium and A. faba and in one against L. maculans.

The supernatants derived from the isolates were used in a bioassay to determine growth inhibition against live B. cinerea spores by measuring turbidity reduction. Growth inhibition was measured against a control (B. cinerea, grown in medium with no added supernatant). Boiled supernatant did not inhibit the growth of B. cinerea spores but there was 100% inhibition by the crude supernatant from ten of the twenty four isolates. Similarly, supernatants were used to assess growth inhibition against live mycelia cultures of F. solani and S. sclerotium. Growth inhibition of F solani ranged from 9- 59%, boiled and crude supernatants respectively whilst growth inhibition of S. sclerotium ranged from 46-75%, boiled and crude supernatants respectively.

Two partial chitinase genes from the soil filamentous  ungus Trichoderma asperellum,(ChiA and ChiB) and a novel glucanase gene from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus (Glu1) were cloned. ChiA, was 639 bp long, encoding 191 amino acids with identity to other chitinase genes. Two highly conserved regions, characteristic of glycosyl hydrolases from family 18, were present.

ChiB, was 887 bp long and encoded a 293 amino acid sequence that was closely related to an endochitinase gene from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma asperellum. The two highly conserved regions corresponding to the substrate binding and active sites that characterise the glycosyl hydrolases from family 18, also found in ChiA, were found in this gene.

Glu1 was 2844 bp long and encoded a 948 amino acid sequence that shared high identity with a &#226;-1, 3-glucanase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The sequence contained conserved regions found in glycosyl hydrolases from family 17 that encode for substrate binding, N-terminal sequences and putative asparagine linked glycosylation sites.

The partial putative sequence ChiA is probably a pseudogene because it has two inframe stop codons. However, once the entire sequence of ChiB is known, both ChiB and the novel glucanase gene Glu1 could be useful contenders for engineering resistance in crop plants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fungal biota</field><field name="subject">chitinase and glucanase enzymes</field><field name="subject">chitinolytic</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071213.105659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading for Sustainability</field><field name="creator">coral.pepper@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Prelude

A short piece to prepare the way
(Sadie and Tyrrell, 2001)

Education for sustainability and educational leadership are the two faces to my research. Although there are differences between the concepts of environmental education and education for sustainability they are often confused. Environmental education deals with awareness raising and encouraging behaviour change to support environmental management and conservation. On the other hand, education for sustainability recognises the transformative role of education, while implicitly referring to intergenerational equity, ecological sustainability and the fair distribution of resources. The confusion is evident at the school level. Leadership is also a term fraught with confusion and misinterpretation. While there are many definitions of leadership, two common perspectives which have persisted over time are definitions of leadership as a matter of influence and of leadership as a skill. In educational terms sustainable leadership represents a shift to capture and merge contemporary leadership theory with the international pressure for sustainability through education. 

There is a dearth of information available to describe education for sustainability despite recognition by both Australian and Western Australian governments of its importance in this, the early years of the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014). The aims of this qualitative research are to capture leaders&#146; understanding of how education for sustainability is conceptualised, incorporated across the curriculum and led in Western Australian government secondary schools. In addition this study seeks to determine how education for sustainability becomes embedded and sustained in these schools. 

The research re-conceptualises leading for sustainability. Four key concepts are identified as essential for embedding education for sustainability into Western Australian government secondary schools. These key concepts are: understanding sustainability; imagining the future; building relationships; and taking action. Combined, they enhance the meagre knowledge base about leading for sustainability in Western Australian secondary schools and provide a springboard for further research in the fields of sustainability and educational leadership.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Western Australian Secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071217.105345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Jolly Good Nutter": A Discursive Psychological Examination of Bipolar Disorder in Psychotherapeutic Interactions</field><field name="creator">don.bysouth@ntu.ac.uk</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines how bipolar disorder, a common and disabling psychiatric condition, is made relevant as a participants&#146; concern in a site of massively consequential psychological business &#150; the psychotherapy session. As its central thesis is the claim that the practices by which bipolar disorder gets done as bipolar disorder are invariably absent in most formal accounts of the disorder. In this regard, the dissertation provides an empirically grounded description of a range of discursive practices associated with the doing of bipolar disorder in psychotherapy. This is undertaken from a discursive psychological orientation that draws extensively from ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and Wittgensteinian philosophy.

Following a review of bipolar disorder as a diagnostic psychiatric category, consideration is given to alternate conceptualisations which suggest the category is constructed in-and-through complex socio-historical practices which are often occluded and considered irrelevant to the category&#146;s situated deployment. This notion is used to provide a more sustained examination of how one might &#145;get at&#146; such practices in situ by way of conducting ethnomethodological and conversation analytically informed investigations. In consideration of how one might approach psychological categorisation practices in talk-in-interaction, a discursive psychological orientation is developed which stresses the social, public nature of psychological categories in use.

The empirical materials examined in the dissertation are drawn from a corpus of audio recordings of seven &#145;naturally occurring&#146; psychotherapy sessions involving a clinical psychologist and five clients for whom the category &#145;bipolar disorder&#146; has demonstrable relevance. Practices examined include those relating to the production and recognition of what might count as a bipolar disorder &#145;symptom&#146;, the manner in which &#145;moods&#146; operate as account production devices, and the methods by which psychological terms (such as &#145;thought&#146; and &#145;feel&#146;) operate in-and-as situated practices involved in psychotherapeutic business.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discursive psychology</field><field name="subject">ethnomethodology</field><field name="subject">conversation analysis</field><field name="subject">bipolar disorder</field><field name="subject">psychotherapy</field><field name="subject">Wittgenstein</field><field name="subject">interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071217.34447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing employee perceptions of trust within organisations</field><field name="creator">judith.marquis@argylediamonds.com.au</field><field name="description">Trust is a complex concept and our understanding of what creates, sustains and builds trust within organisations is variable. The purpose of this study was to examine the antecedent factors influencing employee perceptions of trust in organisations, and this was achieved by aggregating qualitative trust data gathered from four surveys conducted in two related mining companies.

Analyses of questions that referred to trust in the 'company', produced one set of factors which described generalised leader behaviours and characteristics that influence employee perceptions of trust in leaders throughout their employing company. Analyses of questions that referred to employees' trust in their immediate managers produced factors that described behaviours and characteristics influencing their perceptions of trust in the leader with whom respondents had the most intimate supervisory relationship. Many factors were common to both phases of analysis, but the most frequently described was Open and Honest Communication. Some factors were unique to the company analysis, including Managers' Competencies, Provides Benefits, Safety Obligations, Stability of Managerial Personnel and Profit Motives. Others were unique to the immediate manager analyses and included Confidentiality, Consistency and Predictability, and Role Limitations. Similarities and differences in factors described within company analysis and immediate manager analysis were reconciled to produce six factor groupings. The different factor structure found in the company and immediate manager analyses reflect, to some extent, the impact of hierarchical distance on the basis for trust.

Mayer, Davis and Schoorman's (1995) Integrative Model of Organisational Trust was used as a starting point for factor identification and grouping because of its links to previous antecedent factor research. Several factors not represented in that model were extracted. Four factors described leaders' behaviours associated with employee trust: Managers' Competencies, Benevolence, Integrity, and Investment of Role and Task Responsibilities. Propensity to trust was present, but had two subtly different forms. Contextual Factors not represented in Mayer et al.'s, model were also extracted. These factor groups formed the components of an elaborated model of the antecedents of organisational trust.

Exploring trust at the company level as well as the immediate manager level provided important insight into trust behaviours attributed to managers and leaders of the company and those attributed to the immediate manager. Similarities and differences in company and immediate manager analysis provided a strong argument for future trust research making this distinction.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Work environment</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071218.113552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Access, equality and opportunity? : the education of Aboriginal children in Western Australia 1840-1978</field><field name="creator">marnev@cygnus.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is a history of schooling for Indigenous children in Western Australia between
the commencement of the first Aboriginal school in Perth in 1840 and 1978. The thesis
represents the view that, for most of this period, and regardless of policy, education for
Indigenous children was directed towards changing their beliefs and behaviours from
being distinctly Aboriginal to recognizably European. Four major policies for Aborigines
provide the framework for the thesis, these being amalgamation (1840-1852),
protection (1886-1951), assimilation (1951-1972) and self-determination (1973- ).

The amalgamation of the Indigenous popuIation with the small colonial society in
Western Australia was a short-lived policy adopted by the British Colonial Office.
Protection, a policy formalised by Western Australian legislation in 1886, 1905 and
1936, dominated Aboriginal affairs for the first half of the 2ofh century. Under this policy
the Indigenous population was regarded as two distinct groups - a diminishing traditional
population to be segregated and protected and an increasing part-Aboriginal population
that was to be trained and made 'useful'. In 1951 Western Australia accepted a policy of
assimilation, coordinated by the Commonwealth government, which anticipated that all
people of Aboriginal descent would eventually be assimilated into the mainstream
Australian society. This policy was replaced in 1973 by one of Aboriginal community
self-determination, an initiative of the Commonwealth government and adopted
throughout Australia.

The attempts at directed cultural change were evident in the 'Native' schools that opened
in Perth, Fremantle and Guildford in the 1840s where it was assumed that the separation
of children from their families and a Christian education would achieve the transition
from a 'savage to civilized' state. For another century the education of Indigenous
children on missions and in government settlements was founded upon similar
assumptions. The thesis acknowledges that the principal change agents, such as the Chief
Protectors of Aborigines, mission administrators and the teachers in direct contact with
the children, seriously underestimated both the enduring nature of Indigenous culture and
the prejudice in Australian society.

Between 1912 and 1941 a few government schools in the southern districts of Western
Australia refused to admit Aboriginal children. The exclusion of these children is
examined against a background of impoverished living conditions, restrictive legislation
and mounting public pressure on the State and Commonwealth governments for a change
in policy. The change did not begin to occur until 1951 when the Commonwealth and
States agreed to a policy of assimilation. In Western Australia this policy extended
education to all Aboriginal children. The thesis explores the provision of government
teachers to Aboriginal schools in remote areas of Western Australia between 1951 and
1978. The final chapter examines Indigenous perceptions of independent community
schools within the fust five years of the policy of self-determination and contrasts the
objectives and management of two schools, Strelley in the Pilbara and Oombulguni in
the Kimberley.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Western Australian History</field><field name="subject">Pilbara</field><field name="subject">Oombulguni</field><field name="subject">Kimberley</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071218.141027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of L2 methods in atomic scattering</field><field name="creator">Toto Winata</field><field name="description">An L2 expansion of Yamani and Reinhardt [I9751 which employs non-orthogonal, square integrable functions of Laguerre type is used to approximate Coulomb wave functions of continuum and bound states. The convergence of L2 approximations to continuum and bound states is investigated in the hydrogenic case.

The connection between the L2 approximation and pseudo states is derived by studying the completeness relation for the exact states and the quadrature approximations. Corresponding equivalent weights are shown to be related to a Gaussian quadrature derived from attractive-Coulomb Pollaczek polynomials. Gaussian quadrature rules that are satisfied are calculated numerically.

The use of pseudo states in the close-coupling equations is discussed especially in relation to the Poet [1978] model which gives a highly accurate solution for a simplified model of electron-hydrogen collisions in which only s-wave hydrogen target states are admitted. The convergence of channel potentials which contribute to the close-coupling equations is then examined and discussed the convergence of pseudostate Born amplitudes is studied as a further test in obtaining a good pseudo-state set. In addition, the convergence rate of the L2 approximation to the bound-bound, bound-free channel and free-free channel potentials is examined. The bound-bound, bound-free potentials are shown to converge geometrically while the free-free potentials have very slow convergence.

In order to examine the effect of convergence rates several detailed models are employed and compared with the full Poet calculations. Elastic, discrete inelastic, total ionisation and inelastic cross-sections are presented for the energy interval 1.0 to 3.5 Rydbergs. Triplet scattering is reproduced excellently. Singlet scattering displays minor pseudo-resonance structure for the largest (10 basis set) calculations. Weak coupling approximations are examined. They perform very well in triplet scattering but decidedly less well for the singlet channel.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scattering (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Electrons</field><field name="subject">Atoms</field><field name="subject">Collisions</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071218.143249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of a cognitive-behavioural program on test anxiety symptoms in high school students</field><field name="creator">clintandkarolyn@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">The current research project has addressed the issue of the stress and anxiety experienced by Australian senior high school students as they prepare to undertake their final year examinations. Two studies were conducted. The first study looked at the feelings experienced by senior high school students, resources available to them to assist with exam preparation, resources actually accessed, and the strategies used to cope with examinations and associated feelings. Focus group interviews were conducted with 14 Year 11 and 13 Year 12 students from a public senior high school in Perth, Western Australia. Results indicated that students tend to most frequently report using avoidance strategies to cope with preparing and undertaking examinations, supporting previous research findings (e.g., Zeidner, 1996).

The second study examined the effectiveness of a group based, cognitive behavioural program purposely designed to teach students strategies for coping specifically with test anxiety and also generalized anxiety symptoms. The program involved seven one-hour weekly sessions implemented with 31 Year 12 students who were undertaking their final year examinations. The program covered education about the nature and causes of stress and anxiety, relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, imaginal exposure and study skills training.

The pre- and post-intervention scores on the TAI and RCMAS were analyzed using 2 (group) x 2 (gender) x 3 (symptom severity level) full factorial repeated measures ANOVAS. At pre-intervention, there were no significant differences between the treatment (N=31) and control (N=6), except for RCMAS Worry and Over Sensitivity, whereby the treatment group had a higher mean score, consistent with the greater ratio of female to male participants in the treatment group compared to the control group. At post intervention, the treatment group had reduced scores from preintervention levels for TAI Worry and Emotionality, RCMAS Total Anxiety, Physiological, Worry and Over Sensitivity and the Social Issues and Concentration subscales. In contrast, the post-intervention scores for the control group for these measures had increased from pre-intervention levels. However, there was no significant main effect for Group. Anecdotal program evaluation results from the treatment group students revealed that relaxation training was considered the most helpful aspect of the program. In contrast, at-home practice activities were considered the least helpful. A majority of participating students also reported that they believed the program would help them to manage stress and anxiety associated with examinations and other life stressors.

Despite the lack of significant differences between the treatment and control groups in the current study, the pattern of results obtained generally followed that of previous research on the treatment of symptoms for test anxiety (e.g., Wessel &amp; Mersch, 1994) and generalized anxiety (e.g., Kendall, 1994) employing a CBT approach. While the results of the current study may have been limited by the relatively small sample sizes of the treatment and control groups, the short- and longterm benefits of providing training in appropriate coping strategies for test anxiety, such as those involved in cognitive behavioural intervention, are further highlighted.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">test anxiety</field><field name="subject">anxiety disorders</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">cognitive behaviour therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071219.104843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating transactional space for sustainability:  a case study of the Western Australian Collaboration</field><field name="creator">K.Buselich@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Progressing sustainability requires a more networked approach to governance&#151;an approach that connects otherwise segmented policy areas and fosters greater communication among governments, stakeholders and citizens.  Of particular importance is the development of discursive spaces in which diverse actors are able to explore the differing knowledge, perspectives and values raised by the challenge of sustainability.  This thesis develops the notion of transactional space to bring into focus the processes of reflection, dialogue and mutual learning that effective sustainability discourse involves.  In the first part of the thesis I review literature on the theory and practice of participation, deliberation and collaboration, giving particular attention to the ways in which these processes have potential to create space for a depth of exchange and enable participants to engage with the tensions inherent in complex policy issues.  While many authors point to the importance of negotiating difference in these processes, the literature reveals that, in practice, this type of exchange tends to be overlooked or underdeveloped.  I therefore argue in this thesis that critical, reflective dialogue plays a key role in generating greater understanding among participants, more comprehensive understanding of policy issues, and more integrative and shared approaches, and for these reasons must be actively developed.  

The case study in the second part of the thesis explores this concern for developing reflective exchange in practice.  The formation of the Western Australian Collaboration in 2002&#151;a partnership of non-government organizations from a range of social and environmental perspectives committed to &#145;a just and sustainable Western Australia&#146;&#151;represented an opportunity to examine the development of participatory and collaborative processes for sustainability.  The thesis presents a case study of the WA Collaboration&#146;s development over 2002-2006 to illustrate the potential such networks and open forums offer for transformative exchange around sustainability.  It describes the intensive process conducted with the Steering Committee to cultivate a culture of reflection and learning in the organization, and the practical initiatives the process helped to generate.

The thesis concludes with a discussion of the lessons learnt and key principles and practical considerations relevant to fostering transactional space.  The WA Collaboration experience and the review of literature reveal a tendency in practice to privilege action and outcomes over reflection and learning.  Furthermore, despite the necessity for a depth of engagement with complex policy issues, funding systems and policy environments often fail to allow the time and resources needed to support genuine dialogue and collaborative work.  The thesis provides the concept and principles of transactional space as a means of helping to address this imbalance.  They are designed to encourage practitioners to create opportunities for critical, reflective dialogue in a range of deliberative settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">transactional space</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">participatory and deliberative processes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20071220.132317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selecting Medical Students: an Australian Case Study</field><field name="creator">amercer@cyllene.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">The recognition that medical practitioners require more than simply a high level of academic ability to function successfully in their profession, together with a sharp increase in the number of academically qualified applicants to medical courses, has led to new ways of selecting medical students. Consequently the selection of students into the high-stakes course of medicine has become an area of considerable interest and research activity. The issues involved in selection are now prominent in the medical and medical education literature published in the UK, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and in some European countries. At the same time as the introduction of new selection procedures, and independently of it, due to advances in pedagogy the nature of the medical curriculum has also changed. Changes have been characterised by the use of problem-based learning, and an emphasis on self-directed learning, as well as an increase in interaction between the students in classes and between students and their teachers. The recognition that problemsolving, communication and interaction skills in the courses, in addition to the requisite intellectual capacity, would enhance performance as practitioners, has reinforced the need for students to be selected on a different set of attributes from those used previously.

In Australia, changes in the way in which medical students are selected were initiated by the University of Newcastle in the early 1990s, with the introduction of some tests of cognitive skills and an interview. Over the following ten years, the other Australian undergraduate medical schools followed suit and a three-component selection process developed in an attempt to differentiate among the high calibre applicants to medical courses, by identifying additional important skills and attributes. The three components are the academic score, results on an aptitude test and results on a selection interview. Two of the nine undergraduate medical schools chose not to use a selection interview.

The focus of this thesis is on evaluating the new selection processes and investigating the consequences of the admission of school-leaver applicants into undergraduate medical courses, where the Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER) is the academic criterion for determining suitability to undertake tertiary studies. Each undergraduate medical school has developed its own unique way to operationalise the selection of its students. However, the use of the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admissions Test (UMAT), which developed out of the University of Newcastle&#146;s test of cognitive skills, and the conduct of an interview for a select group of applicants are common to these practices. The implementation of the new selection processes has not been without its critics, mainly from within the medical profession. This thesis studies the issues which underlie the three components of selection (the TER, the UMAT and a selection interview) and uses as a case study the particular process used to select students into the six year undergraduate medical course at The University of Western Australia (UWA).

The UWA selection process involves applicants passing a threshold score on each of the three components and then being ranked by a mechanism which combines the three scores with equal weight. This is a compensatory system in which applicants can compensate for a score near the threshold on one component by high scores on the other two components. This study showed that the resultant cohort is eclectic in its characteristics, with the full range of scores (above the threshold) in each component being represented.

Both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were used to address the issues surrounding the way in which medical students are selected and the outcomes of such processes. First, semi-structured interviews were held with different groups of stakeholders, including the staff at secondary schools which prepare the students for tertiary entrance; academic and administrative staff at The University of Western Australia (UWA); academic and administrative staff at other Australian universities; and senior staff at the major teaching hospitals in Western Australia. Secondly, quantitative studies on UWA data addressed the predictive validity of the components of selection; inter-rater reliability and the internal consistency of the data sets from the selection interview; and the attrition rate in the course.

Outcomes from the research showed that in general, the reactions from stakeholders have been positive. Importantly, academic levels amongst medical students and recent graduates do not appear to have been eroded by the new process, in which the academic threshold has been lowered. The UMAT is a contentious national test which has had its validity as a selection instrument questioned. A recent construct and content validity study on the UMAT (Mercer and Chiavaroli, 2006) has gone some way towards settling some of these issues, but the question of predictive validity has yet to be addressed adequately. The existence of commercially available preparation courses has been controversial because of the equity issues involved for those applicants who for some reason do not have access to such courses.

The selection interview, one of the three components of selection, conducted by the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences at UWA, whilst attracting criticism from some for appearing stilted and overly prescriptive, was judged to be robust and rigorous by many of those directly involved in its implementation. Furthermore a high proportion of medical students were judged by their teachers to have good communication skills, which is a positive outcome for future members of the profession. A study to quantify reliability indices for the UWA selection interviews indicated high levels of inter-rater reliability and internal consistency of the ratings data produced.

The predictive validity study conducted as part of this study showed the two major predictors of course outcomes at UWA to be the TER and female gender. The TER predicts outcomes in the knowledge-based units across the course and in some clinically-based units in the later years. However, the interview score (in particular the Communication Skills component) and scores on the first section of UMAT (Logical reasoning and problem solving) also predict outcomes in some of the clinically-based units.

The results of these studies are encouraging to those who believe that the new selection process, whilst imperfect, has gone some way towards solving the problems attached to selection based solely on academic merit. The question now becomes how to improve further on the selection of medical students and to do so in an evidence-based way. The characteristics to be included in selection remain controversial. The rigorous assessment of such characteristics needs to be addressed in the longer term and will be an evolving issue, as the medical curriculum and the nature of the profession also continue to change.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical student selection</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080111.142132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving momentum-space coupled-channels equations for electron-atom scattering using a rotated-contour method</field><field name="creator">A.Blackett@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In the last twenty years, electron-atom scattering theory has witnessed significant theoretical developments. One of these advances is the use of the momentum-space convergent closecoupling approach to fully incorporate target atom continua. This theoretical framework is based on the momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, an integral form of the Schrodinger equation. Although the approach has been highly successful in its application to atomic scattering theory, computing numerical solutions is inherently difficult because the momentum-space LS equation is a singular integral equation. Standard numerical integration techniques are normally employed to solve the problem and as computing power has increased, calculations have improved. However, there remains the problem of the integral's singular nature, which demands complicated methods for selecting integration points, particularly near the energy-dependant singularity. The rotated-contour method uses a conlplex-variable approach that solves the momentum-space LS equation by integrating along a deformed contour in the complex momentum plane away from the singularities. This method has the potential for simplifying the numerical integrations associated with the close-coupling equations.

A rotated-contour method is first applied to a simple scattering model - electron scattering from the Yukawa potential. This gives some insight into the difficulties that arise when calculating potential matrix elements for complex momenta. The method is then applied to the s-wave model of the electron-hydrogen scattering problem and finally, the full problem. Existing FORTRAN software written to solve the momentum-space LS equations for electron-hydrogen scattering using standard techniques has been converted to C++. Extensive modification of the code has resulted in a flexible Windows-based program with a graphical user interface that runs on any modern computer using PC architecture. The program can calculate results using either a conventional method (no rotation) or a rotatedcontour method.

Using a rotated-contour method to solve the momentum-space LS equations necessitates detailed knowledge of the analytic nature and singularity structure of the coupled channels potentials. This is achieved through the extensive use of the computer symbolic algebra system Maple to compute closed-form solutions for the direct potentials and for a range of partial-wave direct and exchange potentials. It is found that logarithmic branch point singularities are present on the real momentum axis for an extensive class of partial-wave direct-potential matrix elements. The analysis reveals that arotated contour method cannot be applied to the full atomic scattering problem due to these analytic problems which are associated with the long-range nature of the Coulomb potential.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electron-atom collisions</field><field name="subject">Electron</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen</field><field name="subject">Scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080114.140142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chineseness at the crossroads : negotiations of Chineseness and the politics of liminality in diasporic Chinese women's lives in Australia</field><field name="creator">a.meerwald@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">Chineseness at the crossroads examines how Chineseness is negotiated by diasporic Chinese women in Australia. I question the essentialist notions of Chineseness by deploying Homi Bhabha's theory of liminality. This concept of being neither here nor there helped me examine the women's ambiguous experiences of acceptance and rejection, within and across marginal and dominant Australian circles. My position disrupts the binaric frames that divide the old from the new, and the eastern from the western practices for cultural appropriation. It recognises instead the past and the present in the creation of new but familiar versions of Chineseness.

I argue that essentialist norms are commuilicated through cultural semantics to inform how Chineseness is rehearsed. I assert that liminality exposes the power structures that inform these cultural semantics by disrupting the naturalised norms. I posit that the diasporic women's awareness of these interdependent processes enables them to question their practices and ideologies.

I used an autoethnographic technique to collapse the divide between the researcher and the researched. It created a liminal space between the researcher and the researched. This subverted norms of the researcher as the archaeologist of knowledge by enabling the other women's narratives to tell their stories alongside mine. This methodological frame also serves as a prism to examine the intersections of gender, sexuality, family, relationships, language, education, class, age, and religion with Chineseness in the lives of the 39 Malaysian and Singaporean women interviewed.

My results indicate that Chineseness is precarious and indeterminate, and specific to the particular moments of articulation at the crossroads of geopolitical and socioeconomic factors. The versions of Chineseness rehearsed are complexly influenced by the various cultural semantics that impact on the women's negotiations of who they are as diasporic Chinese women in Australia. I conclude with a discussion of how these results challenge current curriculum and pedagogical practices in English classrooms. I argue that a re-examination of these practices will contribute to a more inclusive Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women Chinese Australian</field><field name="subject">Ethnic Identity</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Identity Politics</field><field name="subject">National Characteristics</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Hybridity</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080116.113947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships with many facets: unpacking the interactions between protected area managers and commercial tour operators</field><field name="creator">A.Wegner@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">For protected areas worldwide, commercial tour operators are increasingly providing the services and products desired and needed by visitors to these areas. Given the engagement of both protected area managers and tour operators in protected areas, and inevitably with each other, it is critical that their relationship and its complexities are clearly understood. As such, the interests of managers and operators overlap insofar as that they work in the same locales, share some of the burden of service provision, and aim to offer a quality product. However, this study shows that they diverge in other ways, particularly given the commercial imperative that necessarily strongly influences the activities of their business, irrespective of its location. This thesis seeks to unpack the complexities of a relationship that is critically important both in terms of the quality of the tourism experiences offered by protected areas, and the conservation of such areas in the longer term. In order to obtain an understanding of the complexity of the interactions between protected area managers and tour operators, qualitative research methods were used, in which in-depth interviews provided a rich picture of the important diverse aspects and facets impacting on their relationships. This study found that both managers and operators considered the purpose of protected areas to be the conservation of biodiversity and their recreational use and enjoyment. Surprisingly, their similar values were unknown to them. A major influence on their relationships was their perceptions of power, with &#145;dominant&#146; power largely based on legislative and regulatory mandates, perceived to rest with the protected area managers. In contrast, this study also found evidence of &#145;resistant&#146; power. This form of Foucauldian power was held particularly by operators in one geographic locale, and was associated with the concepts of cultural groupings and groupthink. The underlying public policy context influenced the effectiveness of the collaborative efforts of managers and operators. Interwoven with these differences were variable expectations regarding the nature and purpose of communication and what collaboration might &#145;mean&#146;. These findings importantly suggest several future directions for both practice and research. First, managers and operators share values and hold both similar and different expectations and perceptions, similarities and differences which are significant. Secondly, understanding the importance of power and how it is exercised is critical if successful relationships between managers and operators are to be fostered. Finally, further unpackaging of the meaning of communication and collaboration for managers and operators, a process initiated in this study, is essential if relationships between these groups involved in conservation and recreation in protected areas are to be improved. Therefore, this study suggests that their collaboration can be enhanced at individual, organisational/locale and policy levels, by adopting and implementing an action research framework.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">National parks and reserves management</field><field name="subject">Protected areas</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080131.140448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Diminished Subject: An Exploration into the Aporia of the Condition of the Possibility of Change as Represented in Twentieth Century Philosophy and Contemporary Literature</field><field name="creator">G.Bishop@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis acts as an exploration of the notion of an a priori aporia of the always already diminished subject as opposed to an ideal self-present individual, and explores the efforts of a selection of twentieth century continental philosophy to address the crises of scepticism and metaphysics that beset this tradition and its search for the &#145;truth&#146; of being. I will argue that my atemporal philosophical teleology proves in fact that any attempt to determine the finitude of subjectivity represents an ineluctable desire for metaphysical comfort that can, at times, verge on totalitarianism. Furthermore, the divergent temporal loci of these theorists &#151; and their particular attempts to address these recurrent crises &#151; necessarily calls into question the popular perception of a temporally specific &#145;postmodern condition&#146; afflicting the contemporary subject. 

Given the repeated failure of philosophical discourse to provide the subject with its raison d&#146;&#234;tre, a focus on the usefulness of literature in this regard becomes apparent within my theoretical schema, leading to a discussion of several controversial contemporary novels that parallel my proposition of the diminished subject, and refute negative perceptions of them as postmodern and valueless due to an apparent nihilistic &#145;anything goes&#146; attitude. However, rather than resorting to na&#239;ve utopianism regarding the positive uses of literature, I argue that these texts reiterate the key theoretical propositions in this thesis with an awareness of the discursive nature of the subject and the a priori condition of the possibility of change which inevitably undermine transcendence. It is my proposition that these texts can be read as fictionalised expressions of the cathartic possibilities of literature, and an innate desire in all subjects for the metaphysics of comfort when faced with the meaninglessness of existence, something exacerbated by the recurrent failure of philosophical and religious discourses to counter the aporia of an always already absent self-presence of subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">aporia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080131.155325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Dialogic Reimagining of a Servant's Suffering: Understanding Second Isaiah's Servant of Yahweh as a Polyphonic Hero</field><field name="creator">David.Williams@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">A definitive identification of the Servant figure of Second Isaiah is notoriously difficult, as attested by centuries of conjecture and debate. The interpretive obstacles are profuse: the Servant is addressed as Israel-Jacob, but then spoken of in terms that are not consistent with the nation&#146;s experience; in some texts he seems to represent a community, while in others he speaks as an individual; he seems to suffer extreme hardship and persecution, but then is said to experience new life; some of his experiences appear to be historical, while others are best described as idealistic. Further hampering objective interpretations are the pervasive traditional approaches among Christian and Jewish readers, which associate the Servant, equally emphatically, with Jesus or Israel.  

But a primary reason the Servant is so difficult to pin down is rarely considered, and that is that there exists no objective image of the Servant anywhere in Second Isaiah. As a literary character he is constituted entirely by dialogue; that is, by discourse addressed to him, spoken by him, and spoken about him by others in the form of a confession. His actions are never described, and his person is never defined. Scholars have referred to this as his &#147;fluid&#148; nature, but have lacked the methodological tools for a fuller study of this literary curiosity. 

The ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin speak to this type of characterisation. His &#147;polyphonic hero&#148; is a fictional character who is constituted by what is spoken to him or her, by what they overhear said concerning them, and by how they make that discourse, and the discourse of the wider world, an aspect of their own self-knowledge. They become known only by the discourse that converges on them, much as the Servant of Second Isaiah is constituted. This thesis develops a reading strategy based on Bakhtin&#146;s theory of the polyphonic hero, as well as his broader theories of dialogism. It reimagines the inner discourse of the Servant in order to comprehend him according to the dialogue by which he knows himself, and not according to conventional reading strategies that seek for a fixed, opaque image. In the process it discovers that there are not multiple Servants, which is often posited as a solution to the problem of his fluid nature, but one Servant, Israel-Jacob, whose self-knowledge as the faithful Servant of Yahweh calls empirical Israel to faith in a time of national distress. It concludes that the Servant is present in the collection of Second Isaiah as a &#147;voice-idea&#148;, the embodiment of a theologically critical position that calls many of Israel&#146;s theological and ideological presuppositions into question, in order to liberate her for a renewed history as a faithful &#147;witness&#148; to Yahweh her redeemer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Second Isaiah</field><field name="subject">suffering Servant</field><field name="subject">Israel</field><field name="subject">exile</field><field name="subject">prophets</field><field name="subject">Babylon</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080131.165508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maritime Piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, 1992-2006: A Prismatic Interpretation of Security</field><field name="creator">c.liss@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Southeast Asia and Bangladesh are at present global hot-spots of pirate attacks on merchant vessels and fishing boats. This thesis explains why, and in what form, piracy still exists. It will argue that an examination of contemporary piracy is important because it can be understood as both a symptom and a reflection of a range of geo-political and socio-economic problems and security concerns.

The thesis examines pirate attacks on small craft, including fishing boats, and merchant vessels in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh between 1992 and 2006. It describes the different types of contemporary pirate attacks, identifies piracy hot-spots, and looks at the various kinds of pirates active in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Furthermore, it discusses a number of factors which have contributed to the shaping of modern day piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Issues examined in this regard include the impact of ecological degradation and over-fishing on the occurrence of piracy; loop-holes and shortcomings in maritime laws and regulations that are conducive to the operations of pirates; the involvement of transnational crime syndicates and radical politically motivated groups in piracy; and the problems with state and private responses to pirate attacks. 

It will be argued that the examination of these factors reveals not only how they shape piracy, but that they also have an impact upon security well beyond pirate attacks. Examining piracy in this way is akin to looking through a prism, allowing a critical gaze to be cast over a range of political, social, and ecological developments, as well as security risks, and their impact on the lives and circumstances of people in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, and the wider international community. It will be suggested that piracy and the various responses to it both reflect political and social developments within countries, and co-operation, tension and friction between states. Additionally, it will be demonstrated that the occurrence of pirate attacks in a region or a country indicates the existence of a wide range of traditional and non-traditional security risks, which can have far reaching repercussions for individuals, nations, or the international community. Through the examination of piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, and the responses it triggers, important new trends and practices in the security sector are also identified, including the increasing privatisation of security and protection services around the globe.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maritime Piracy</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Crime</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080218.120400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-thinking &#145;staff management&#146; in independent schools: An exploration of a human resource management approach</field><field name="creator">s.roberts@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">While the mission and &#145;core business&#146; of schools has always been directed towards the education and pastoral support of the children, the staff who work to fulfil the mission and business have received less attention. With recent media reporting on anticipated teacher shortages, pedagogical issues and the quality of teaching the focus has shifted to the staff in schools. With evidence linking student achievements and academic outcomes to teacher impact, recruitment and retention have become significant issues, particularly in independent schools where parental expectations are high. Expertise in relation to human resource (HR) activities such as recruitment and retention, staff management and staff development, however, is not well developed in schools. This study therefore seeks to explore and understand staff management using a framework based on human resource management (HRM). It also examines the recent trend of appointing dedicated Human Resource (HR) practitioners to independent schools and the reasons behind these appointments.

A qualitative research approach was adopted in order to better understand the issues and reveal the complexity that surrounds them. In all, seven independent schools were purposely selected from urban Western Australia, and the principals, finance directors and HR practitioners from these schools were interviewed to gain their perspectives. The conceptual framework draws on the business-derived human resource management (HRM) and the HR activities within this domain. The analytical framework used was that of the &#145;hard&#146;/ &#145;soft&#146; duality contained within HRM, which allowed tensions, such as that between &#145;independent schools as businesses&#146; and independent schools as &#145;communities with heart&#146;, to be highlighted and examined.

The interviews revealed a broad understanding and knowledge by respondents of HR activities considered &#145;necessary&#146; for the recruitment, and the day-to day management of staff, including remuneration, and to some extent, induction and performance management systems. Most revealing in these schools was the lack of structure and strategy in the implementation of the various HR activities and ways to work through the hard/soft duality. By way of contrast, the HR practitioners appointed to five of the independent schools had a broad based knowledge of all HR activities and were attempting to &#145;educate&#146; those in schools about HRM and what the function, collectively applied, could do for them. They encountered entrenched attitudes and, in some schools, resistance caused by misunderstandings associated with both the role and function.

The thesis concludes with implications and recommendations for independent school leaders on the application of HRM in their schools. By re-thinking the paradigm of staff management in this way, and through the adoption of a systematic and holistic approach using the suite of HR activities, both hard and soft, the research points to the potential for improvements in the quality of teaching staff recruited and retained, and ultimately also in student outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">staff management in schools</field><field name="subject">human resource management in schools</field><field name="subject">human resource practitioners in schools</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080411.121602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of need accounting for (dis)advantage: public housing co-operatives in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">C.Lacroix@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Concerns about the nature of poverty and how to achieve equitable resource distribution are rife in Australia where, as elsewhere, welfare resources are becoming increasingly scarce. At the heart of these concerns are questions about access: in particular, how to ensure that the least affluent are able to access the resources they require. At the same time, there is a growing sense that cultural as well as social factors are central to patterns of unequal distribution, especially in a neo-liberal context where there is a deregulation of social and economic structures, and a shift to consumption or lifestyle capitalism.

This thesis employs Bourdieu&#146;s theoretical framework of capitals to examine the nature of affluence (and therefore poverty) in Australia, the processes that facilitate access to material resources by the affluent rather than the poor and, ultimately, the notion of need that underpins questions of choice, access and resource allocation. Drawing on interviews with members of publicly funded housing co-operatives in WA, an example of welfare housing that simultaneously represents an example of a deregulated symbolic economy and an expression of the contemporary lifestyle movement, I highlight key resources and interests that distinguish these individuals as affluent, as well as some of the cultural and social processes that enable them to convert their resources into the subsidised housing. Based on this analysis, I then interrogate the frameworks for understanding poverty that regulate the distribution of welfare resources, and argue that these were central to the ability of the more affluent to secure publicly funded housing resources. In particular, I examine the new multidimensional frameworks for understanding poverty in terms of their ability to recognise key resources and processes.

I argue that Bourdieu&#146;s framework &#150; as a resource based framework that accounts for cultural as well as social and economic factors in the (re)production of advantage and disadvantage &#150; represents a worthwhile inclusion into theories and policies that are concerned with accounting for poverty and ensuring that residual welfare aims are met.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080411.150027</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syndicated Loans in the United States (1995-2000): Announcement Effects, Long-Term Performance and Capital Structure Issues from a Borrower Perspective.</field><field name="creator">K.Le@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of announcements of syndicated loans on the share prices of borrowing firms.  I use a sample of 5,465 loan observations reported in the International Financing Review Platinum database to study this impact. Event study methodology is used. My overall results show significantly positive wealth effects on the borrowing firms. However, when I partition my data set into revolving credit agreements, term loans and hybrid loans, I find that the results are driven primarily by revolving credit agreements.  I also observe that the size of the event window plays an important role in identifying the wealth effects for the borrowers.  A five-day event window (-2, +2) shows share price response to revolving credit announcements to be significantly positive.  A three-day event window (-1, +1) reveals that announcements are statistically positive for revolving credit agreements and statistically negative for term loan announcements.  My results are consistent with previous studies in this area. I also distinguish between financial press announcements and information provider (IFR) announcements to cater for the potential for reporting bias.  I find that both the IFR and financial press announcements are significant for the five-day window, but only the financial press results are significant for the three-day window.  My study is unique in that I differentiate the impact of different sources of information on the market reaction to borrower share price.

In addition to the examination of the wealth effect, I also use the structure of the loans to examine the uniqueness of bank loans and their ability to provide financial slack.  Specifically, I examine whether revolving credit loans or term loans or hybrid loans make bank loans unique and their ability to provide financial slack. I observe that out of the three structures of bank loan, only revolving credit loans allow the borrower to more precisely match the funds acquired with the firm&#226;&#128;&#153;s investment needs and to market time by borrowing at times when financing costs are attractive. Revolving credit loans are positively valued by the market both initially and over the longer term. Bank loans reduce information asymmetry, but the renegotiation characteristics of revolving credit loans allow borrowers to exploit changes in the interest rate environment, thus providing support for the market timing theory of capital structure.  In contrast to puzzling results of previous studies, I present evidence of long-term positive performance following bank loans.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Syndicated Loans</field><field name="subject">Announcement Effects and Long-Term Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080414.120320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a functional genomics approach to the identification of vaccine subunits and diagnostic antigens for use in the control of swine dysentery</field><field name="creator">yong.song@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is the causative agent of swine dysentery (SD), a diarrhoeal disease of pigs which has significant economic impact worldwide. Controlling SD remains problematic, particularly as there is no effective vaccine and there are few definitive diagnostic methods available. In this study, a partial genomic sequence of B. hyodysenteriae was screened in silico. A total of 19 putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding outer-membrane proteins then were selected and these were subjected to a laboratory screening process. To select potential universal vaccines, a preliminary study was conducted using PCR to determine the distribution of the putative genes in 23 strains of B. hyodysenteriae. A total of 17 of the 19 ORFs were considered to be suitable for further testing as they were found to be present in the majority of strains investigated. After molecular cloning and protein expression and purification, of 19 cloned candidate molecules derived from 17 genes (one large gene was divided into two parts encoding N and C terminal proteins, respectively), 14 were expressed in E. coli and the recombinant proteins were successfully produced. A variety of sera from pigs naturally and experimentally infected with B. hyodysenteriae were tested for reactivity with the 14 recombinant proteins in an immunoblotting assay. Seven molecules from six genes reacted strongly with the tested sera, and therefore were selected and used to immunize mice. All these proteins generated a specific antibody response. Post-immunization sera raised against each recombinant protein had the capacity to agglutinate B. hyodysenteriae cells, and also recognized the cognate proteins of B. hyodysenteriae in cell extracts. Further sequencing analysis demonstrated that these molecules were highly conserved in the genomes of different B.hyodysenteriae strains. Therefore, from the genomic based study, the products of six genes were identified as promising candidates for vaccines or as diagnostic targets.

Four genes were expressed on a large scale, the product (NAV-H7, NAV-H17 Cterminal, NAV-H34 and NAV-H42) were combined into one vaccine, and then this preparation was used to immunise pigs that subsequently were challenged with B. hyodysenteriae. These antigens generate systemic and colonic antibody responses, and vaccination tended both to delay the onset of clinical signs and attenuate lesion development. Hence these recombinant proteins showed promise as components for further SD vaccines. Recombinant proteins from the selected genes also were used as antigens in class-specific ELISAs used as serological assays for SD. Three antigens (NAV-H8, NAV-H42 and Bhlp29.7) were selected as good indicators of seroconversion in IgM ELISAs, and these were evaluated further using a large range of serum samples. The NAV-H8 IgM ELISA using a cut-off value 2.5 times the mean value of all negative pigs could be used as a herd test for SD, and both the NAV-H8 and NAV-H42 IgM ELISAs had potential for detecting exposure to B. hyodysenteriae at the pig level.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swine dysentery</field><field name="subject">genomic</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080416.131148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-Stakeholder Public Policy Governance and its Application to the Internet Governance Forum</field><field name="creator">Jeremy@malcolm.id.au</field><field name="description">There are many networks of transport and communication that cross national borders, but the Internet&#146;s infrastructure has been designed to do so with unusual subtlety. As a result, public policy issues raised in governance of the Internet tend to be inherently transnational in nature. This makes the legitimacy of a purely domestic legal approach to Internet governance questionable. The fact that conflicting domestic regimes may interfere with each other, and may clash with the transnational cultural and technical architecture of the Internet, further complicates an approach to governance based around legal rules. But on the other hand more traditional and decentralised mechanisms of Internet governance such as norms, markets and architecture suffer their own deficits of both legitimacy and effectiveness.

Governance by multi-stakeholder network conceptually provides a solution in that it brings together each of the other mechanisms of governance and the stakeholders by whom they are commonly employed. Such a multi-stakeholder approach has begun to permeate (and in some issue areas even to supersede) the existing international system, as partially evidenced in the Internet governance regime by reforms that took root at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and have begun to find expression in its product, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).

Governance by network does not however emerge spontaneously, but requires supportive institutional structures and processes. To maximise the legitimacy and effectiveness of these, and to ensure their interoperability both with the international system and with the architecture of the Internet, requires a balance to be struck between the anarchistic and consensual organisational models typified by &#147;native&#148; Internet governance institutions such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and hierarchical and democratic models drawn from governmental and private sector examples and from the study of deliberative democracy.

As an early experiment in multi-stakeholder governance by network, the Internet Governance Forum does not quite strike the correct balance: its hierarchical structure under the leadership of the United Nations is incompatible with its multi-stakeholder democratic ambitions, and more importantly it lacks the institutional capacity to fulfil its mandate to contribute to public policy development.

This can largely be redressed by reforming the IGF&#146;s plenary body, and its online analogue, as venues for democratic deliberation, subject to the oversight of an executive body or bureau to which each stakeholder group appoints its own representatives, and which is responsible for ratifying any decisions of the larger group by consensus. In particular, requiring this bureau to broker consensus between stakeholder groups (as in a consociation), rather than just amongst its members at large, can assist to diminish the power games that have limited the IGF to date.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet governance</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080416.94945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conventional and Deep-litter Pig Production Systems: The effects on fat deposition and distribution in growing female Large White x Landrace Pigs</field><field name="creator">mtrezona@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Minimising variability in carcass quality to better meet market specifications is a priority for Australian pig producers, however issues with variability in carcass fat distribution have recently been raised, particularly in the belly primal. There has been a rapid increase in the use of low-cost, deep-litter (DL) housing systems in Australia over the past 15 years for rearing pigs. The inherent differences between the physical, thermal, and social environments of conventional (C) and DL production systems may well alter the growth path of the pig and subsequently alter fat metabolism and hence fat deposition and distribution. The general industry view is that pigs finished in DL housing are fatter and grow less efficiently than pigs finished in C housing, however contrasting carcass and growth performance results have been reported between housing systems. It is likely that the different housing environments affect the maintenance energy requirements of the growing pig, thereby affecting the availability of substrates for fat deposition and/or the requirements for fat mobilisation. Hence, raising pigs in C and/or DL production systems was identified as a likely contributor to variability in carcass fat distribution via the effects of the disparate environments on fat metabolism. 

The overall purpose of this thesis was to establish the effect of keeping pigs in C and/or DL housing systems on fat metabolism, and therefore fat deposition in the growing pig and fat distribution in the finished carcass. Industry considers that finishing pigs in C facilities allows greater flexibility in feeding and marketing decisions, allowing growth efficiency and backfat to be managed more effectively than in a DL system. Therefore an aspect of this thesis was to also examine the effects of an alternative management strategy, raising pigs in a combination of DL and C housing, on growth performance and fat deposition and distribution in the carcass. The presence of straw bedding is a major difference between C and DL housing systems. This was identified as a probable contributor to the differences in growth performance and carcass fat distribution found between pigs raised in the different housing systems, via its thermal properties and/or the ingestion of the straw on pig growth.

Experiment 1a and 1b were designed to test the hypothesis that the growth path differs for pigs raised in C and DL housing systems, affecting biochemical indicators of fat metabolism and therefore fat accretion and distribution in the carcass. The study was conducted as a serial slaughter of pigs housed in C and DL systems allowing the pattern of fat accretion, and therefore the distribution of fat in the carcass, to be determined from 15&#168;C185 kg live weight (LW). The results confirmed the hypothesis that the growth path, fat accretion and fat distribution in the carcass differed for pigs raised in C and DL housing systems. 

In Experiment 1a, elevated lipogenic enzyme activities, higher percentages of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and higher concentrations of plasma glucose and lactate indicated lipogenesis was elevated in C pigs to 13 weeks of age, compared to young DL pigs, suggesting that fat accretion was higher in young C pigs. At 24 weeks of age however there was a shift in lipogenic enzyme activities, the percentage of SFA in backfat and the concentration of plasma glucose were higher in DL-housed pigs than C-housed pigs, indicating higher rates of lipogenesis. Elevated concentrations of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glycerol in DL pigs indicated that lipolysis, or fat mobilisation, was higher in DL-housed pigs for the entire growth period. The results from Experiment 1b clearly indicated that during early growth, C pigs grew faster than DL pigs (0.71 vs 0.66 kg/day, P&#161;&#220;0.05) and were heavier between 8-23 weeks of age (P&#161;&#220;0.05). Therefore in conjunction with the results of Experiment 1a, it was expected that young C pigs would be fatter than DL pigs of the same age. However, dissection indicated no treatment differences in total carcass composition, although there was an effect of housing on carcass fat distribution with a trend (P=0.087) for a lower ratio of fat:lean in the belly primal of DL pigs compared to C pigs at 13 weeks of age. After 20 weeks of age however, growth rates were similar for pigs in both housing treatments and by 26 weeks of age there were no treatment differences in live weight (LW) but the rate of fat accretion in DL pigs, particularly in the loin and belly primals, increased rapidly. Differences in the thermal environments of C and DL housing, and therefore differences in the energy demand for thermoregulation, were likely to have contributed to the differences measured in lipogenesis, growth performance and carcass fat distribution. 

Experiment 2a and 2b tested the hypothesis that moving pigs from DL to C housing for finishing would improve overall growth performance and reduce carcass fatness compared to pigs raised in wean-to-finish DL housing. The biochemical measurements indicated few differences in the rate of lipogenesis between 13-week-old C and DL pigs. However, and in agreement with the findings from Experiment 1a, elevated plasma NEFA concentrations in DL pigs suggested higher rates of lipolysis. Up to 13 weeks of age, pigs in the DL housing system grew faster than C pigs, however similar to the findings of Experiment 1b, DL pigs were less efficient. In addition, P2 backfat depth was less in DL pigs, indicating they were leaner than C pigs, and though not reflected in total carcass composition, again there was an effect of housing on fat distribution. The move to an unfamiliar housing environment affected growth performance, reduced enzyme activity in backfat and the ratio of SFA in belly fat, suggesting these pigs had lower rates of lipogenesis. However in  contrast to Experiment 1a, where lipogenesis was higher in older DL pigs compared to older C pigs, pigs finished in the DL housing had a trend for lower enzyme activity in belly fat (P=0.063), suggesting lower rates of lipogenesis, and higher plasma glycerol concentrations, suggesting a higher level of lipolysis compared to C-finished pigs. The carcass composition data (Experiment 2b) found that though there were no differences indicated by differences in P2 depth, there was a strong trend (P=0.057) for DL-finished pigs to have 2-6% less fat in the carcass as a result of significantly less fat in the shoulder (15% vs 17%) and belly (29% vs 33%) primals compared to C-finished pigs. The difference in belly primal composition was a reflection of the lower enzyme activities in belly fat and higher plasma glycerol concentrations in DL finished pigs. The results suggest that the type of housing during the finishing growth period has a greater impact on fat accretion and carcass composition than the type of housing during the grower period, or changing housing environment during growth. However, changing housing environment at 13 weeks of age affected growth, where there was a temporary reduction in daily LW gain, and therefore significantly lower (P&#161;&#220;0.001) LW at slaughter (117 kg LW), compared to pigs that had remained in C or DL housing from wean-to-finish (123 kg LW).  Moving pigs from DL to C housing to control carcass fat and improve growth performance compared to pigs grown wean-to-finish in DL housing, was not successful, and had a negative impact on performance and carcass quality by reducing growth efficiency and LW and increasing carcass fatness. The results also showed that contrary to the industry view that DL raised pigs are fatter, pigs in this experiment finished in DL housing had a lower fat:lean ratio in the carcass than pigs finished in the C system (P&#161;&#220;0.05).

The effects of straw on growth performance and carcass composition were evaluated in Experiment 3a and 3b by including straw in the grower and finisher diets (St+) and/or providing straw bedding (Bed+) to C-housed pigs. The experiment tested the hypothesis that the presence of straw alters the growth paths of pigs, affecting fat distribution in the carcass. Straw, as bedding and in the diet, affected pig growth paths and altered carcass fat distribution and, consistent with the findings for DL pigs in Experiments 1b and 2b, there was a trend for pigs with access to straw to have less fat in the belly (P=0.072).

Elevated activity of key enzymes involved in lipogenesis, measured in Experiment 3a in belly fat and backfat from pigs fed the St+ diet, and a higher ratio of SFA in belly fat of pigs housed on concrete without straw bedding, suggested that in this experiment straw ingestion increased lipogenesis in belly fat and backfat of the growing pig, whilst straw bedding reduced lipogenesis in belly fat. Experiment 3b demonstrated an additive effect of straw on growth where average LW at slaughter for pigs without access to straw was significantly lower (110 kg), compared to pigs with access to one source of straw either via the diet or bedding (115 and 114 kg LW respectively), and pigs that had two sources of straw available (119 kg LW) (P&#161;&#220;0.05). Although LW differed between treatments there were no differences in total carcass fat (P&gt;0.10), yet there was an effect of straw on fat distribution. Pigs with access to straw had a lower ratio of fat and a higher ratio of lean tissue in the belly primal (P=0.072) compared to pigs that did not have straw. The effect of straw ingestion on lipogenesis and fat deposition may have occurred via the effects of dietary fibre (DF) on the dilution of dietary energy density. Pigs were able to compensate for the energy/nutrient dilution by increasing VFI and therefore growth was not affected, however fat acts as an insulator, and localised differences in fat distribution may have been related to increased heat production (HP) from the digestion of greater volumes of feed. In response, fat deposition may have been directed away from the belly location in order to facilitate heat loss. Floor type may have also affected fat distribution via differences in thermal conductivity. Straw has a lower thermal conductivity than concrete, hence pigs housed on concrete flooring may have a greater requirement for fat in the belly to reduce conductive heat loss. Results from Experiment 3a and 3b provided evidence that pigs housed on bedding consume straw in sufficient quantities. Pigs fed the straw diet had significantly higher concentrations of plasma acetate than pigs fed the control diet (P&#161;&#220;0.001), and there was a trend for pigs housed on straw bedding to have higher levels than pigs without access to straw. An increase in plasma acetate can indicate increased microbial activity in gut, which occurs in response to higher levels of DF. In addition, pigs bedded on straw had higher gastrointestinal tract weights, which can also indicate higher levels of DF intake. 

Regression analyses of data across experiments showed that P2 backfat depth, the primary carcass composition prediction tool, accounted for less than 50% of the variation in percent carcass fat (R2=0.41). Furthermore, across experiments, P2 accounted for very little of the variability in percent belly fat (R2=0.01). These results highlight the inconsistency of P2 depth as a reliable indicator of carcass composition and the need for the development of additional criteria to be used in the selection of carcasses for specific markets as the composition of the belly primal was not indicated by the current carcass measurement system.

From the results obtained in this thesis, it was proposed that:
1)	The growth path of pigs is altered by the housing system in which they are reared and the more variable ambient temperature of the DL housing system would increase the energy requirement of young pigs for thermoregulation. As a consequence of the altered growth paths, fat metabolism differs for pigs raised in DL and C production systems. Lower rates of lipogenesis may occur in young DL pigs compared to C pigs and this can change as pigs grow, however fat mobilisation remains higher in DL pigs during growth. 
2)	Differences in the rate of lipogenesis, indicated by the biochemical measures, were generally not reflected in total carcass composition, however there were differences in carcass fat distribution where pigs raised in DL systems consistently had less fat in the belly primal. Rearing environment may provide an additional criterion when selecting carcasses for specific markets where variability in belly composition is an issue. 
3)	Pig raised in the DL environment are not always fatter than pigs housed in C facilities, and moving pigs from one housing environment to another during the growing-finishing period disrupts the growth path reducing growth performance and can increase carcass fatness.
4)	Straw bedding, via ingestion and via its physical thermal properties, affects pig growth and fat distribution and may explain in-part the differences in pig growth performance and carcass quality found between C and DL housing systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carcass composition</field><field name="subject">fat deposition</field><field name="subject">fat distribution</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">pig</field><field name="subject">straw</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080418.105619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychic phenomena: Meditation perception, actuality - an Australian study</field><field name="creator">clogherau@yahoo.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of an investigation into contemporary psychic phenomena as reported by Australian students.

It uses a questionnaire which involves the matching of perceptions of specific psychic phenomena, rather than an examination of psychic phenomena as such. The questionnaire is based on a medical diagnostic model. Its findings are benchmarked against a previous study and compared with other empirical studies.

A comparison of the study's findings with those of more directly religious investigations undertaken overseas in countries with a longer monotheistic religious history than Australia:

provides insight into the Australian attitude, generally recognised as being secular, towards psychic and or spiritual experiences;

indicates that meditation is not necessarily a prerequisite for experience of psychic and or spiritual phenomena; and

argues that commonalities between specific experiences, reported not only within the Australian secular survey but also as reported in the predominantly religious overseas studies, demonstrate that the scientific requirement of repeatability has been met, thus providing ground to believe in the actuality of the reported experiences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meditation</field><field name="subject">Replication</field><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080429.120838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Manaakitanga i roto i ng&#257; ahumahi T&#257;poi - the interpretation of manaakitanga from a M&#257;ori tourism supplier perspective</field><field name="creator">Martin, Frances Kahui</field><field name="description">Manaakitanga plays an important role in M&#257;ori society. There are several meanings associated to this M&#257;ori cultural concept, one of which refers to the fostering and nurturing of relationships between a host and a visitor.  The well-being of the visitor is paramount to the development of this relationship as the mana (prestige) of the host is at stake. If the host fails to manaaki (support) their visitor this could result in the loss of mana within the M&#257;ori community as the host has shown they are incapable of attending to the needs of others. In recent times, there has been an increased presence of the term manaakitanga in tourism related documents, which has generated several interpretations of this cultural concept. Currently, various government organisations use this concept as a basis for developing both short and long-term strategies. This is particularly noticeable in the New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2015. However, there are varied interpretations of the term manaakitanga by the tourism industry, which are in conflict with M&#257;ori operators understanding and knowledge of manaakitanga reflected in their businesses. In order to contextualise the experiences and perspectives provided by M&#257;ori tourism operators, a theoretical framework has been developed. This framework called &#8216;Te K&#333;hai&#8217; located in kaupapa M&#257;ori (M&#257;ori ideology) ideology best reflects the world-view of the participants who form the basis of this study. Thus, this study has been prompted by the research question - how is manaakitanga interpreted in a M&#257;ori tourism operation?  Possible misinterpretation of manaakitanga may result in the concept being used incorrectly and the transgression of cultural practices, thus compromising the experiences offered by M&#257;ori tourism operations. It is important then, to investigate, whether manaakitanga is understood as &#8216;hospitality&#8217; in the tourism industry and more specifically, by people who work within a M&#257;ori tourism operation. Additionally, it is important to determine how staff employed in a M&#257;ori tourism operation, understand and portray this concept. Subsequently, interpretations of manaakitanga from the perspective of M&#257;ori tourism operators, forms the basis of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori ideology</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Added value to business</field><field name="subject">Tourism and indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Organisational ideology</field><field name="subject">Organizational ideology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and development of 'Pasja' and kale crops with two methods and four rates of phosphorus (P) application</field><field name="creator">Chakwizira, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">*&#8216;Pasja&#8217; (Brassica campestris x napus) and kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala L.) were grown at Lincoln, Canterbury, New Zealand in 2008 with different levels of phosphorus (P) fertiliser. Banded or broadcast P fertiliser was applied at 0, 20, 40 and 60 kg P/ha at establishment. Total dry matter (DM) production, the proportion of the leaf and stem and leaf area development were measured over time and related to the biophysical environment.	For &#8216;Pasja&#8217;, final DM increased with P rate from 3730 kg DM/ha to ~4900 kg DM/ha at 60 kg P/ha. For kale the increase was from 8710 kg DM/ha for the control to ~11000 kg DM/ha for all P treatments. The leaf to stem ratio declined from 22-31 at 17 days after emergence to 10.4 at the final harvest for &#8216;Pasja&#8217;, which meant the crop was effectively made up mainly of leaf (~90%). The ratio for kale declined from 2.7 at 24 days after emergence to 0.64 at the final harvest. The leaf to stem ratio for both species did not respond to either the method of application or rate of P. Seedling DM accumulation increased with applied P over the first 10 to 17 DAE for &#8216;Pasja&#8217; and kale respectively. The crops went from shoot growth priority to root growth. 	The phyllochron of both species was unaffected by P application but responded linearly to the temperature above 0&#176;C. For &#8216;Pasja&#8217; the phyllochron was 60&#176;Cd compared with 109&#176;Cd for kale. As a consequence &#8216;Pasja&#8217; developed its canopy and reached critical leaf area index (LAIcrit) earlier than kale.	Leaf area index (LAI) for the control crops of both species was lower than for P fertiliser treatments with a maximum of 3.6 for &#8216;Pasja&#8217; and 3.8 for kale. There was no difference in leaf area indices among the P fertiliser treatments for &#8216;Pasja&#8217;, while kale LAI differed with the rate of P application up to 40 kg P/ha. Total accumulated intercepted solar radiation (RIcum) was 8 and 11% greater for &#8216;Pasja&#8217; and kale crops respectively when P was applied compared with the control. Thus, the difference in total dry matter yield due to P application was attributed to the difference in RIcum. Neither the method of application or rate of P applied affected the radiation use efficiency (RUE) of either crop. For &#8216;Pasja&#8217; the RUE was 1.1 g DM/MJ PAR and for kale 1.33 g DM/MJ PAR. 	Based on this research, it was concluded that P application increased RIcum as a result of increased LAI. The difference in total DM yield was attributed to differences in RIcum.	It is recommended that farmers growing &#8216;Pasja&#8217; and kale under similar conditions to this experiment should apply 40 kg P/ha for &#8216;Pasja&#8217; and band 20 kg P/ha for kale. *&#8216;Pasja&#8217; is considered both as a species and cultivar in this document as it marketed as such in New Zealand. Technically &#8216;Pasja&#8217; is a leaf turnip.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brassica campestris L.</field><field name="subject">Brassica oleracea acephala L.</field><field name="subject">critical leaf area index</field><field name="subject">DM accumulation</field><field name="subject">extinction coefficient</field><field name="subject">leaf area index</field><field name="subject">leaf to stem ratio</field><field name="subject">method of application</field><field name="subject">phyllochron</field><field name="subject">radiation use efficiency</field><field name="subject">solar radiation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::309900 Other Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::309901 Fertilisers and agrochemicals (application etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voluntary environmental reporting: the why, what and how</field><field name="creator">De Silva, T-A.</field><field name="description">Society is increasingly calling for organisations to demonstrate corporate social responsibility (CSR). To fulfil this demand, organisations need to be accountable, democratic and transparent to their stakeholders. This can be achieved using a number of tools including communication about the environmental, social and economic impacts of an organisation&#8217;s actions and activities. Yet despite the importance of communicating environmental information, and society&#8217;s heightened environmental awareness, organisations are still demonstrating an insufficient commitment to environmental reporting, continuing their reluctance to be open and accountable about their environmental impacts. This suggests organisations currently have little understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should report. For environmental reporting progress to be achieved it is important that we have knowledge of how various factors influence voluntary environmental reporting engagement. This research, in contributing to and extending the body of environmental reporting knowledge, aims to provide an understanding of the Why, What and How of voluntary environmental reporting by specifically examining: why organisations should, and why organisations do, voluntarily report environmental information; what environmental information organisations should, and what environmental information organisations do, voluntarily report; and how organisations should, and how organisations do, voluntarily report environmental information.  In using a combination of research methodologies this research extends prior CSR reporting studies &#8211; closing the gap between voluntary environmental reporting practice and theory, providing better insights into the underlying reasons and motivations for voluntary environmental reporting, and providing improved knowledge of the considerations made by companies as part of the voluntary environmental reporting process. In doing so, this research presents a more recent examination of voluntary environmental reporting in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies. Aspects of voluntary environmental reporting that have not been extensively examined before, particularly in Australasia, are examined. These include a focus on content-quality (as opposed to reporting quantity), an investigation of the effect of public pressure (using a combination of three proxy measures), and, through the use of qualitative research, an expansion of the insights obtained from quantitative data. This research finds that New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies continue to have an insufficient and incorrect understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should voluntarily report environmental information. This deficient understanding results in voluntary environmental reporting in their annual reports which is inadequate &#8211; the reporting lacks meaning and purpose (i.e. has form but little or no substance), and reflects managers&#8217; incorrect perceptions about the environmental impact of their company&#8217;s actions and activities. As a result voluntary environmental reporting in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies fails to &#8220;&#8230; give an understanding, which is not misleading, &#8230;&#8221; of the environmental consequences of an organisation&#8217;s actions and activities (adapted from Alexander &amp; Jermakowicz, 2006, p. 132), providing little accountability to stakeholders, and serving neither external stakeholders nor those reporting well. As the demand for organisations to demonstrate accountability to stakeholders continues to increase over time it is important to develop informed environmental reporting guidance and undertake further examinations of the Why, What and How of environmental reporting.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental reporting</field><field name="subject">public pressure</field><field name="subject">content-quality</field><field name="subject">reporting quality</field><field name="subject">social contract</field><field name="subject">legitimacy theory</field><field name="subject">reputation</field><field name="subject">social licence to operate</field><field name="subject">Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s299(1)(f)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It's just part of the job isn't it?
