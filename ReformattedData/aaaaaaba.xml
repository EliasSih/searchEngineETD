<add><doc><field name="title">The neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal characterization of children with joint hypermobility</field><field name="creator">Netscher, Heather Gayle</field><field name="description">In children, joint hypermobility (typified by structural instability of joints) manifests clinically as neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal conditions and conditions associated with development and organization of control of posture and gait (Finkelstein, 1916; Jahss, 1919; Sobel, 1926; Larsson, Mudholkar, Baum and Srivastava, 1995; Murray and Woo, 2001; Hakim and Grahame, 2003; Adib, Davies, Grahame, Woo and Murray, 2005:). The process of control of the relative proportions of joint mobility and stability, whilst maintaining equilibrium in standing posture and gait, is dependent upon the complex interrelationship between skeletal, muscular and neurological function (Massion, 1998; Gurfinkel, Ivanenko, Levik and Babakova, 1995; Shumway-Cook and Woollacott, 1995). The efficiency of this relies upon the integrity of neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal components (ligaments, muscles, nerves), and the Central Nervous System&#8217;s capacity to interpret, process and integrate sensory information from visual, vestibular and proprioceptive sources (Crotts, Thompson, Nahom, Ryan and Newton, 1996; Riemann, Guskiewicz and Shields, 1999; Schmitz and Arnold, 1998) and development and incorporation of this into a representational scheme (postural reference frame) of body orientation with respect to internal and external environments (Gurfinkel et al., 1995; Roll and Roll, 1988). Sensory information from the base of support (feet) makes significant contribution to the development of reference frameworks (Kavounoudias, Roll and Roll, 1998). Problems with the structure and/ or function of any one, or combination of these components or systems, may result in partial loss of equilibrium and, therefore ineffectiveness or significant reduction in the capacity to interact with the environment, which may result in disability and/ or injury (Crotts et al., 1996; Rozzi, Lephart, Sterner and Kuligowski, 1999b).
 
 Whilst literature focusing upon clinical associations between joint hypermobility and conditions requiring therapeutic intervention has been abundant (Crego and Ford, 1952; Powell and Cantab, 1983; Dockery, in Jay, 1999; Grahame, 1971; Childs, 1986; Barton, Bird, Lindsay, Newton and Wright, 1995a; Rozzi, et al., 1999b; Kerr, Macmillan, Uttley and Luqmani, 2000; Grahame, 2001), there has been a deficit in controlled studies in which the neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal characteristics of children with joint hypermobility have been quantified and considered within the context of organization of postural control in standing balance and gait. This was the aim of this project, undertaken as three studies.
 
 The major study (Study One) compared the fundamental neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal characteristics of 15 children with joint hypermobility, and 15 age (8 and 9 years), gender, height and weight matched non-hypermobile controls. Significant differences were identified between previously undiagnosed hypermobile (n=15) and non-hypermobile children (n=15) in passive joint ranges of motion of the lower limbs and lumbar spine, muscle tone of the lower leg and foot, barefoot CoP displacement and in parameters of barefoot gait. Clinically relevant differences were also noted in barefoot single leg balance time. There were no differences between groups in isometric muscle strength in ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion or extension. 
 
 The second comparative study investigated foot morphology in non-weight bearing and weight bearing load conditions of the same children with and without joint hypermobility using three dimensional images (plaster casts) of their feet. The preliminary phase of this study evaluated the casting technique against direct measures of foot length, forefoot width, RCSP and forefoot to rearfoot angle. Results indicated accurate representation of elementary foot morphology within the plaster images. The comparative study examined the between and within group differences in measures of foot length and width, and in measures above the support surface (heel inclination angle, forefoot to rearfoot angle, normalized arch height, height of the widest point of the heel) in the two load conditions. Results of measures from plaster images identified that hypermobile children have different barefoot weight bearing foot morphology above the support surface than non-hypermobile children, despite no differences in measures of foot length or width. 
 
 Based upon the differences in components of control of posture and gait in the hypermobile group, identified in Study One and Study Two, the final study (Study Three), using the same subjects, tested the immediate effect of specifically designed custom-made foot orthoses upon balance and gait of hypermobile children. The design of the orthoses was evaluated against the direct measures and the measures from plaster images of the feet. This ascertained the differences in morphology of the modified casts used to mould the orthoses and the original image of the foot. The orthoses were fitted into standardized running shoes. The effect of the shoe alone was tested upon the non-hypermobile children as the non-therapeutic equivalent condition. Immediate improvement in balance was noted in single leg stance and CoP displacement in the hypermobile group together with significant immediate improvement in the percentage of gait phases and in the percentage of the gait cycle at which maximum plantar flexion of the ankle occurred in gait.  
 
 The neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal characteristics of children with joint hypermobility are different from those of non-hypermobile children. The Beighton, Solomon and Soskolne (1973) screening criteria successfully classified joint hypermobility in children. As a result of this study joint hypermobility has been identified as a variable which must be controlled in studies of foot morphology and function in children. The outcomes of this study provide a basis upon which to further explore the association between joint hypermobility and neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal conditions, and, have relevance for the physical education of children with joint hypermobility, for footwear and orthotic design processes, and, in particular, for clinical identification and treatment of children with joint hypermobility.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">balance control, centre of pressure displacement, children, children&#8217;s posture control, Duvtale orthoses, foot morphology, foot orthoses, gait, joint hypermobility, joint ranges of motion, muscle strength, muscle tone</field><field name="subject">neuro-muscular and musculo-skeletal characteristics, non-weight bearing, orthotic design, plaster casts, postural development, proprioception, weight bearing</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30295/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a particle number and particle mass emissions inventory for an urban fleet : a study in South-East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Keogh, Diane Underwood</field><field name="description">Motor vehicles are a major source of gaseous and particulate matter pollution in urban areas, particularly of ultrafine sized particles (diameters &lt; 0.1 &#181;m).  Exposure to particulate matter has been found to be associated with serious health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and mortality.  Particle emissions generated by motor vehicles span a very broad size range (from around 0.003-10 &#181;m) and are measured as different subsets of particle mass concentrations or particle number count. However, there exist scientific challenges in analysing and interpreting the large data sets on motor vehicle emission factors, and no understanding is available of the application of different particle metrics as a basis for air quality regulation.  To date a comprehensive inventory covering the broad size range of particles emitted by motor vehicles, and which includes particle number, does not exist anywhere in the world.   This thesis covers research related to four important and interrelated aspects pertaining to particulate matter generated by motor vehicle fleets. These include the derivation of suitable particle emission factors for use in transport modelling and health impact assessments; quantification of motor vehicle particle emission inventories; investigation of the particle characteristic modality within particle size distributions as a potential for developing air quality regulation; and review and synthesis of current knowledge on ultrafine particles as it relates to motor vehicles; and the application of these aspects to the quantification, control and management of motor vehicle particle emissions.  In order to quantify emissions in terms of a comprehensive inventory, which covers the full size range of particles emitted by motor vehicle fleets, it was necessary to derive a suitable set of particle emission factors for different vehicle and road type combinations for particle number, particle volume, PM1, PM2.5 and PM1 (mass concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameters &lt; 1 &#181;m, &lt; 2.5 &#181;m and &lt; 10 &#181;m respectively). The very large data set of emission factors analysed in this study were sourced from measurement studies conducted in developed countries, and hence the derived set of emission factors are suitable for preparing inventories in other urban regions of the developed world.  These emission factors are particularly useful for regions with a lack of measurement data to derive emission factors, or where experimental data are available but are of insufficient scope.      The comprehensive particle emissions inventory presented in this thesis is the first published inventory of tailpipe particle emissions prepared for a motor vehicle fleet, and included the quantification of particle emissions covering the full size range of particles emitted by vehicles, based on measurement data.  The inventory quantified particle emissions measured in terms of particle number and different particle mass size fractions.  It was developed for the urban South-East Queensland fleet in Australia, and included testing the particle emission implications of future scenarios for different passenger and freight travel demand.      The thesis also presents evidence of the usefulness of examining modality within particle size distributions as a basis for developing air quality regulations; and finds evidence to support the relevance of introducing a new PM1 mass ambient air quality standard for the majority of environments worldwide.  The study found that a combination of PM1 and PM10 standards are likely to be a more discerning and suitable set of ambient air quality standards for controlling particles emitted from combustion and mechanically-generated sources, such as motor vehicles, than the current mass standards of PM2.5 and PM10.  The study also reviewed and synthesized existing knowledge on ultrafine particles, with a specific focus on those originating from motor vehicles.  It found that motor vehicles are significant contributors to both air pollution and ultrafine particles in urban areas, and that a standardized measurement procedure is not currently available for ultrafine particles. The review found discrepancies exist between outcomes of instrumentation used to measure ultrafine particles; that few data is available on ultrafine particle chemistry and composition, long term monitoring; characterization of their spatial and temporal distribution in urban areas; and that no inventories for particle number are available for motor vehicle fleets.  This knowledge is critical for epidemiological studies and exposure-response assessment.  Conclusions from this review included the recommendation that ultrafine particles in populated urban areas be considered a likely target for future air quality regulation based on particle number, due to their potential impacts on the environment.    The research in this PhD thesis successfully integrated the elements needed to quantify and manage motor vehicle fleet emissions, and its novelty relates to the combining of expertise from two distinctly separate disciplines - from aerosol science and transport modelling.  The new knowledge and concepts developed in this PhD research provide never before available data and methods which can be used to develop comprehensive, size-resolved inventories of motor vehicle particle emissions, and air quality regulations to control particle emissions to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">air quality regulation, ambient aerosol, emission factors, modality of particle size distribution, motor vehicles, motor vehicle inventory, particle mass, particle number, particle volume, PM1, PM2.5, PM10, South-East Queensland, submicrometre particles</field><field name="subject">tailpipe emissions, traffic, transport modelling, ultrafine particles, urban fleet</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30297/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drama and the dreaming : framing the play West of West Wirrawong</field><field name="creator">Sherman, Paul Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two parts, a stageplay "West of West Wirrawong" and an accompanying exegesis.

Emotional pain is experienced as a shattering of the sense of self and disconnection from others and, when unresolved, produces avoidant responses which inhibit the healing process.  
 There is agreement across therapeutic modalities that exposure to emotional experience can increase the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.  Moreno proposes that the activation of spontaneity is the primary curative factor in psychodrama and that healing occurs when the protagonist (client) engages with his or her wider social system and develops greater flexibility in response to that system.  An extensive case-report literature describes the application of the psychodrama method in healing unresolved painful emotional experiences, but there is limited empirical research to verify the efficacy of the method or to identify the processes that are linked to therapeutic change.  
 The purpose of this current research was to construct a model of protagonist change processes that could extend psychodrama theory, inform practitioners&#8217; therapeutic decisions and contribute to understanding the common factors in therapeutic change.  Four studies investigated protagonist processes linked to in-session resolution of painful emotional experiences.  Significant therapeutic events were analysed using recordings and transcripts of psychodrama enactments, protagonist and director recall interviews and a range of process and outcome measures.  
 A preliminary study (3 cases) identified four themes that were associated with helpful therapeutic events: enactment, the working alliance with the director and with group members, emotional release or relief and social atom repair.  The second study (7 cases) used Comprehensive Process Analysis (CPA) to construct a model of protagonists&#8217; processes linked to in-session resolution.  This model was then validated across four more cases in Study 3.  Five meta-processes were identified: (i) a readiness to engage in the psychodrama process; (ii) re-experiencing and insight; (iii) activating resourcefulness; (iv) social atom repair with emotional release and (v) integration.  Social atom repair with emotional release involved deeply experiencing a wished-for interpersonal experience accompanied by a free flowing release of previously restricted emotion and was most clearly linked to protagonists&#8217; reports of reaching resolution and to post session improvements in interpersonal relationships and sense of self.  Acceptance of self in the moment increased protagonists&#8217; capacity to generate new responses within each meta-process and, in resolved cases, there was evidence of spontaneity developing over time.    
 The fourth study tested Greenberg&#8217;s allowing and accepting painful emotional experience model as an alternative explanation of protagonist change.  The findings of this study suggested that while the process of allowing emotional pain was present in resolved cases, Greenberg&#8217;s model was not sufficient to explain the processes that lead to in-session resolution.  The protagonist&#8217;s readiness to engage and activation of resourcefulness appear to facilitate the transition from problem identification to emotional release.  Furthermore, experiencing a reparative relationship was found to be central to the healing process.
 This research verifies that there can be in-session resolution of painful emotional experience during psychodrama and protagonists&#8217; reports suggest that in-session resolution can heal the damage to the sense of self and the interpersonal disconnection that are associated with unresolved emotional pain.  A model of protagonist change processes has been constructed that challenges the view of psychodrama as a primarily cathartic therapy, by locating the therapeutic experience of emotional release within the development of new role relationships.  The five meta-processes which are described within the model suggest broad change principles which can assist practitioners to make sense of events as they unfold and guide their clinical decision making in the moment.  Each meta-process was linked to specific post-session changes, so that the model can inform the development of therapeutic plans for individual clients and can aid communication for practitioners when a psychodrama intervention is used for a specific therapeutic purpose within a comprehensive program of therapy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brief structured recall, catharsis, change process research, comprehensive process analysis, emotion, enactment, in-session resolution, interpersonal process recall, Morenian role theory , psychodrama, painful emotional experience, multiple case studies</field><field name="subject">social atom, spontaneity theory</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30310/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between communication and team performance : testing moderators and identifying communication profiles in established work teams</field><field name="creator">Hassall, Stacey Lee</field><field name="description">Communication is one team process factor that has received considerable research attention in the team literature. This literature provides equivocal evidence regarding the role of communication in team performance and yet, does not provide any evidence for when communication becomes important for team performance. This research program sought to address this evidence gap by a) testing task complexity and team member diversity (race diversity, gender diversity and work value diversity) as moderators of the team communication &#8212; performance relationship; and b) testing a team communication &#8212; performance model using established teams across two different task types. The functional perspective was used as the theoretical framework for operationalizing team communication activity. The research program utilised a quasi-experimental research design with participants from a large multi-national information technology company whose Head Office was based in Sydney, Australia. Participants voluntarily completed two team building exercises (a decision making and production task), and completed two online questionnaires. 
 In total, data were collected from 1039 individuals who constituted 203 work teams. Analysis of the data revealed a small number of significant moderation effects, not all in the expected direction. However, an interesting and unexpected finding also emerged from Study One. Large and significant correlations between communication activity ratings were found across tasks, but not within tasks. This finding suggested that teams were displaying very similar profiles of communication on each task, despite the tasks having different communication requirements. Given this finding, Study Two sought to a) determine the relative importance of task versus team effects in explaining variance in team communication measures for established teams; b) determine if established teams had reliable and discernable team communication profiles and if so, c) investigate whether team communication profiles related to task performance. 
 Multi-level modeling and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that task type did not have an effect on team communication ratings. However, teams accounted for 24% of the total variance in communication measures. Through cluster analysis, five reliable and distinct team communication profiles were identified. Consistent with the findings of the multi-level analysis and repeated measures ANOVA, teams&#8217; profiles were virtually identical across the decision making and production tasks. A relationship between communication profile and performance was identified for the production task, although not for the decision making task. 
 This research responds to calls in the literature for a better understanding of when communication becomes important for team performance. The moderators tested in this research were not found to have a substantive or reliable effect on the relationship between communication and performance. However, the consistency in team communication activity suggests that established teams can be characterized by their communication profiles and further, that these communication profiles may have implications for team performance. The findings of this research provide theoretical support for the functional perspective in terms of the communication &#8211; performance relationship and further support the team development literature as an explanation for the stability in team communication profiles. This research can also assist organizations to better understand the specific types of communication activity and profiles of communication that could offer teams a performance advantage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication, team performance, moderators, communication profiles, established work teams</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30311/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience in chronic disease : the relationships among risk factors, protective factors, adaptive outcomes, and the level of resilience in adults with diabetes</field><field name="creator">Huang, Min-Feng</field><field name="description">Background: There are innumerable diabetes studies that have investigated associations between risk factors, protective factors, and health outcomes; however, these individual predictors are part of a complex network of interacting forces. Moreover, there is little awareness about resilience or its importance in chronic disease in adulthood, especially diabetes. Thus, this is the first study to: (1) extensively investigate the relationships among a host of predictors and multiple adaptive outcomes; and (2) conceptualise a resilience model among people with diabetes. Methods: This cross-sectional study was divided into two research studies. Study One was to translate two diabetes-specific instruments (Problem Areas In Diabetes, PAID; Diabetes Coping Measure, DCM) into a Chinese version and to examine their psychometric properties for use in Study Two in a convenience sample of 205 outpatients with type 2 diabetes. In Study Two, an integrated theoretical model is developed and evaluated using the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 345 people with type 2 diabetes from the endocrine outpatient departments of three hospitals in Taiwan. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed a one-factor structure of the PAID-C which was similar to the original version of the PAID. Strong content validity of the PAID-C was demonstrated. The PAID-C was associated with HbA1c and diabetes self-care behaviours, confirming satisfactory criterion validity. There was a moderate relationship between the PAID-C and the Perceived Stress Scale, supporting satisfactory convergent validity. The PAID-C also demonstrated satisfactory stability and high internal consistency. A four-factor structure and strong content validity of the DCM-C was confirmed. Criterion validity demonstrated that the DCM-C was significantly associated with HbA1c and diabetes self-care behaviours. There was a statistical correlation between the DCM-C and the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist, suggesting satisfactory convergent validity. Test-retest reliability demonstrated satisfactory stability of the DCM-C. The total scale of the DCM-C showed adequate internal consistency. Age, duration of diabetes, diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, physical activity, coping strategies, and social support were the most consistent factors associated with adaptive outcomes in adults with diabetes. Resilience was positively associated with coping strategies, social support, health-related quality of life, and diabetes self-care behaviours. Results of the structural equation modelling revealed protective factors had a significant direct effect on adaptive outcomes; however, the construct of risk factors was not significantly related to adaptive outcomes. Moreover, resilience can moderate the relationships among protective factors and adaptive outcomes, but there were no interaction effects of risk factors and resilience on adaptive outcomes. Conclusion: This study contributes to an understanding of how risk factors and protective factors work together to influence adaptive outcomes in blood sugar control, health-related quality of life, and diabetes self-care behaviours. Additionally, resilience is a positive personality characteristic and may be importantly involved in the adjustment process among people living with type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confirmatory factor analysis, moderator, protective factor, psychometric testing, reliability, resilience, risk factor, structural equation modelling, type 2 diabetes, validity</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30313/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structuring free-form tagging in online news</field><field name="creator">Lau, Cher Han (Andy)</field><field name="description">Tagging has become one of the key activities in next generation websites which allow users selecting short labels to annotate, manage, and share multimedia information such as photos, videos and bookmarks. Tagging does not require users any prior training before participating in the annotation activities as they can freely choose any terms which best represent the semantic of contents without worrying about any formal structure or ontology. However, the practice of free-form tagging can lead to several problems, such as synonymy, polysemy and ambiguity, which potentially increase the complexity of managing the tags and retrieving information. To solve these problems, this research aims to construct a lightweight indexing scheme to structure tags by identifying and disambiguating the meaning of terms and construct a knowledge base or dictionary. News has been chosen as the primary domain of application to demonstrate the benefits of using structured tags for managing the rapidly changing and dynamic nature of news information. One of the main outcomes of this work is an automatically constructed vocabulary that defines the meaning of each named entity tag, which can be extracted from a news article (including person, location and organisation), based on experts suggestions from major search engines and the knowledge from public database such as Wikipedia. To demonstrate the potential applications of the vocabulary, we have used it to provide more functionalities in an online news website, including topic-based news reading, intuitive tagging, clipping and sharing of interesting news, as well as news filtering or searching based on named entity tags. The evaluation results on the impact of disambiguating tags have shown that the vocabulary can help to significantly improve news searching performance. The preliminary results from our user study have demonstrated that users can benefit from the additional functionalities on the news websites as they are able to retrieve more relevant news, clip and share news with friends and families effectively.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">folksonomy, social tagging, online news, digital news</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30315/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socio-environmental factors and suicide in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Qi, Xin</field><field name="description">Suicide has drawn much attention from both the scientific community and the public. Examining the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide is essential in developing suicide prevention strategies and interventions, because it will provide health authorities with important information for their decision-making. However, previous studies did not examine the impact of socio-environmental factors on suicide using a spatial analysis approach.  
 
 The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of suicide and to examine how socio-environmental factors impact on suicide over time and space at the Local Governmental Area (LGA) level in Queensland. The suicide data between 1999 and 2003 were collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Socio-environmental variables at the LGA level included climate (rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature), Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) and demographic variables (proportion of Indigenous population, unemployment rate, proportion of population with low income and low education level). Climate data were obtained from Australian Bureau of Meteorology. SEIFA and demographic variables were acquired from ABS. A series of statistical and geographical information system (GIS) approaches were applied in the analysis. This study included two stages. The first stage used average annual data to view the spatial pattern of suicide and to examine the association between socio-environmental factors and suicide over space. The second stage examined the spatiotemporal pattern of suicide and assessed the socio-environmental determinants of suicide, using more detailed seasonal data. 
 
 In this research, 2,445 suicide cases were included, with 1,957 males (80.0%) and 488 females (20.0%). In the first stage, we examined the spatial pattern and the determinants of suicide using 5-year aggregated data. Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Then a Poisson regression model was applied in the multivariable analysis, as the occurrence of suicide is a small probability event and this model fitted the data quite well. Suicide mortality varied across LGAs and was associated with a range of socio-environmental factors. The multivariable analysis showed that maximum temperature was significantly and positively associated with male suicide (relative risk [RR] = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.07). Higher proportion of Indigenous population was accompanied with more suicide in male population (male: RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03). There was a positive association between unemployment rate and suicide in both genders (male: RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.06; female: RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.16). No significant association was observed for rainfall, minimum temperature, SEIFA, proportion of population with low individual income and low educational attainment. 
 
 In the second stage of this study, we undertook a preliminary spatiotemporal analysis of suicide using seasonal data. Firstly, we assessed the interrelations between variables. Secondly, a generalised estimating equations (GEE) model was used to examine the socio-environmental impact on suicide over time and space, as this model is well suited to analyze repeated longitudinal data (e.g., seasonal suicide mortality in a certain LGA) and it fitted the data better than other models (e.g., Poisson model). The suicide pattern varied with season and LGA. The north of Queensland had the highest suicide mortality rate in all the seasons, while there was no suicide case occurred in the southwest. Northwest had consistently higher suicide mortality in spring, autumn and winter. In other areas, suicide mortality varied between seasons. This analysis showed that maximum temperature was positively associated with suicide among male population (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.47) and total population (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.32). Higher proportion of Indigenous population was accompanied with more suicide among total population (RR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.19) and by gender (male: RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.13; female: RR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.48). Unemployment rate was positively associated with total (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.59) and female (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.18) suicide. There was also a positive association between proportion of population with low individual income and suicide in total (RR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.48) and male (RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.72) population. Rainfall was only positively associated with suicide in total population (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.19). There was no significant association for rainfall, minimum temperature, SEIFA, proportion of population with low educational attainment. The second stage is the extension of the first stage. Different spatial scales of dataset were used between the two stages (i.e., mean yearly data in the first stage, and seasonal data in the second stage), but the results are generally consistent with each other. 
 
 Compared with other studies, this research explored the variety of the impact of a wide range of socio-environmental factors on suicide in different geographical units. Maximum temperature, proportion of Indigenous population, unemployment rate and proportion of population with low individual income were among the major determinants of suicide in Queensland. However, the influence from other factors (e.g. socio-culture background, alcohol and drug use) influencing suicide cannot be ignored. An in-depth understanding of these factors is vital in planning and implementing suicide prevention strategies. 
 
 Five recommendations for future research are derived from this study: (1) It is vital to acquire detailed personal information on each suicide case and relevant information among the population in assessing the key socio-environmental determinants of suicide; (2) Bayesian model could be applied to compare mortality rates and their socio-environmental determinants across LGAs in future research; (3) In the LGAs with warm weather, high proportion of Indigenous population and/or unemployment rate, concerted efforts need to be made to control and prevent suicide and other mental health problems; (4) The current surveillance, forecasting and early warning system needs to be strengthened, to trace the climate and socioeconomic change over time and space and its impact on population health; (5) It is necessary to evaluate and improve the facilities of mental health care, psychological consultation, suicide prevention and control programs; especially in the areas with low socio-economic status, high unemployment rate, extreme weather events and natural disasters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">generalized estimating equations model, geographical information system, Poisson regression model, spatiotemporal analysis, socio-environmental factors, suicide</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30317/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damage assessment in structures using vibration characteristics</field><field name="creator">Shih, Hoi Wai</field><field name="description">Changes in load characteristics, deterioration with age, environmental influences and random actions may cause local or global damage in structures, especially in bridges, which are designed for long life spans. Continuous health monitoring of structures will enable the early identification of distress and allow appropriate retrofitting in order to avoid failure or collapse of the structures. In recent times, structural health monitoring (SHM) has attracted much attention in both research and development. Local and global methods of damage assessment using the monitored information are an integral part of SHM techniques. In the local case, the assessment of the state of a structure is done either by direct visual inspection or using experimental techniques such as acoustic emission, ultrasonic, magnetic particle inspection, radiography and eddy current. A characteristic of all these techniques is that their application requires a prior localization of the damaged zones. The limitations of the local methodologies can be overcome by using vibration-based methods, which give a global damage assessment. The vibration-based damage detection methods use measured changes in dynamic characteristics to evaluate changes in physical properties that may indicate structural damage or degradation. The basic idea is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Changes in the physical properties will therefore cause changes in the modal properties. Any reduction in structural stiffness and increase in damping in the structure may indicate structural damage. This research uses the variations in vibration parameters to develop a multi-criteria method for damage assessment. It incorporates the changes in natural frequencies, modal flexibility and modal strain energy to locate damage in the main load bearing elements in bridge structures such as beams, slabs and trusses and simple bridges involving these elements.

Literature has shown that older people prefer to stay independent and live at home for as long as possible. Therefore, it is important to find out how to best accommodate and assist them in maintaining quality of life and independence as well as easing human resources. Researchers have claimed that assistive devices assist in older people&#8217;s independence, however, only a small number of studies regarding the efficiency of assistive devices have been undertaken of which several have stated that devices are not being used. The overall aim of this research was to identify whether the disuse and ineffectiveness of assistive devices are related to change in abilities or related to the design of the devices. The objective was to gather information from the elderly; to identify what assistive devices are being used or not used and to gain an understanding on their attitudes towards assistive devices. Research was conducted in two phases. The initial phase of the research was conducted with the distribution of questionnaires to people over the age of fifty that asked general questions and specific questions on type of devices being used. Phase One was followed on by Phase Two, where participants from Phase One who had come in contact with assistive devices were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Questions were put forth to the interviewee on their use of and attitudes towards assistive devices. Findings indicated that the reasons for the disuse in assistive devices were mostly design related; bulkiness, reliability, performance of the device, difficulty of use. The other main reason for disuse was socially related; elderly people preferred to undertake activities on their own and only use a device as a precaution or when absolutely necessary. They would prefer not having to rely on the devices. Living situation and difference in gender did not affect the preference for the use of assistive devices over personal assistance. The majority strongly supported the idea of remaining independent for as long as possible. In conclusion, this study proposes that through these findings, product designers will have a better understanding of the requirements of an elderly user. This will enable the designers to produce assistive devices that are more practical, personalised, reliable, easy to use and tie in with the older people&#8217;s environments. Additional research with different variables is recommended to further justify these findings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elderly people, activities of daily living, quality of life, assistive devices, attitudes, performance, frequency of use, effectiveness, sensory devices, bathroom devices, mobility devices</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of national culture on communication practices : a case study on Malaysian organisation</field><field name="creator">Amir, Sabrina</field><field name="description">National culture is deeply rooted in values, which are learned and acquired when we are young (2007, p. 6), and &#8222;embedded deeply in everyday life. (Newman &amp; Nollen, 1996, p. 754). Values have helped to shape us into who we are today. In other words, as we grow older, the cultural values we have learned and adapted to will mould our daily practices. This is reflected in our actions, behaviours, and the ways in which we communicate. Based on the previous assertion, it can be suggested that national culture may also influence organisational culture, as our &#8222;behaviour at work is a continuation of behaviour learned earlier. (Hofstede, 1991, p. 4). Cultural influence in an organisation could be evidenced by looking at communication practices: how employees interact with one another as they communicate in their daily practices. Earlier studies in organisational communication see communication as the heart of an organisation in which it serves, and as &#8222;the essence of organised activity and the basic process out of which all other functions derive. (Bavelas and Barret, cited in Redding, 1985, p. 7). Hence, understanding how culture influences communication will help with understanding organisational behaviour. This study was conducted to look at how culture values, which are referred to as culture dimensions in this thesis, influenced communication practices in an organisation that was going through a change process. A single case study was held in a Malaysian organisation, to investigate how Malaysian culture dimensions of respect, collectivism, and harmony were evidenced in the communication practices. Data was collected from twelve semi-structured interviews and five observation sessions. Guided by six attributes identified in the literature, (1) acknowledging seniority, knowledge and experience, 2) saving face, 3) showing loyalty to organisation and leaders, 4) demonstrating cohesiveness among members, 5) prioritising group interests over personal interests, and 6) avoiding confrontations of Malaysian culture dimensions, this study found eighteen communication practices performed by employees of the organisation. This research contributes to the previous cultural work, especially in the Malaysian context, in which evidence of Malaysian culture dimensions of respect, collectivism, and harmony were displayed in communication practices: 1) acknowledging the status quo, 2) obeying orders and directions, 3) name dropping, 4) keeping silent, 5) avoiding questioning, 6) having separate conversations, 7) adding, not criticising, 8) sugar coating, 9) instilling a sense of belonging, 10) taking sides, 11) cooperating, 12) sacrificing personal interest, 13) protecting identity, 14) negotiating, 15) saying &#8222;yes. instead of &#8222;no., 16) giving politically correct answers, 17) apologising, and 18) tolerating errors. Insights from this finding will help us to understand the organisational challenges that rely on communication, such as during organisational change. Therefore, data findings will be relevant to practitioners to understand the impact of culture on communication practices across countries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">national culture, malaysian culture, culture dimensions, communication practices, respect, collectivism, harmony</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30321/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detecting and characterising malicious executable payloads</field><field name="creator">Andersson, Stig</field><field name="description">Buffer overflow vulnerabilities continue to prevail and the sophistication of attacks targeting these vulnerabilities is continuously increasing. As a successful attack of this type has the potential to completely compromise the integrity of the targeted host, early detection is vital. This thesis examines generic approaches for detecting executable payload attacks, without prior knowledge of the implementation of the attack, in such a way that new and previously unseen attacks are detectable. Executable payloads are analysed in detail for attacks targeting the Linux and Windows operating systems executing on an Intel IA-32 architecture. The execution flow of attack payloads are analysed and a generic model of execution is examined. A novel classification scheme for executable attack payloads is presented which allows for characterisation of executable payloads and facilitates vulnerability and threat assessments, and intrusion detection capability assessments for intrusion detection systems. An intrusion detection capability assessment may be utilised to determine whether or not a deployed system is able to detect a specific attack and to identify requirements for intrusion detection functionality for the development of new detection methods. Two novel detection methods are presented capable of detecting new and previously unseen executable attack payloads. The detection methods are capable of identifying and enumerating the executable payload&#8217;s interactions with the operating system on the targeted host at the time of compromise. The detection methods are further validated using real world data including executable payload attacks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intrusion detection, network-based intrusion detection, code injection attack, buffer overflow, executable payload</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review of the economic consequences of a policy of universal leucodepletion as compared to existing practices</field><field name="creator">Clare, Virginia Mary</field><field name="description">Leucodepletion, the removal of leucocytes from blood products improves the safety of blood transfusion by reducing adverse events associated with the incidental non-therapeutic transfusion of leucocytes.  Leucodepletion has been shown to have clinical benefit for immuno-suppressed patients who require transfusion.  The selective leucodepletion of blood products by bed side filtration for these patients has been widely practiced. This study investigated the economic consequences in Queensland of moving from a policy of selective leucodepletion to one of universal leucodepletion, that is providing all transfused patients with blood products leucodepleted during the manufacturing process.  Using an analytic decision model a cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted.  An ICER of $16.3M per life year gained was derived.  Sensitivity analysis found this result to be robust to uncertainty in the parameters used in the model.    This result argues against moving to a policy of universal leucodepletion.  However during the course of the study the policy decision for universal leucodepletion was made and implemented in Queensland in October 2008.

It is suggested that rivalry is not necessarily enacted by individual firms according to the traditional mechanisms of direct confrontation in factor and product markets, but rather as collaborative orchestration between a number of participants or network members. Strategic networks are recognised as sets of firms within an industry that exhibit denser strategic linkages among themselves than other firms within the same industry. Based on this, strategic networks are determined according to evidence of strategic alliances between firms comprising the industry. As a result, a single strategic network represents a group of firms closely linked according to collaborative ties. Arguably, the collective outcome of these strategic relationships engineered between firms suggest that the collaborative benefits attributed to interorganisational relationships require closer examination in respect to their propensity to influence rivalry in intraindustry environments. Derived in large from the social sciences, network theory allows for the micro and macro examination of the opportunities and constraints inherent in the structure of relationships in strategic networks, establishing a relational approach upon which the conduct and performance of firms can be more fully understood. Research to date has yet to empirically investigate the relationship between strategic networks and rivalry. The limited research that has been completed utilising a network rationale to investigate competitive patterns in contemporary industry environments has been characterised by a failure to directly measure rivalry. Further, this prior research has typically embedded investigation in industry settings dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives, such as the microprocessor and airline industries. These industries, due to the presence of such imperatives, are arguably more inclined to support the realisation of network rivalry, through subscription to prescribed technological standards (eg., microprocessor industry) or by being bound by regulatory constraints dictating operation within particular market segments (airline industry). In order to counter these weaknesses, the proposition guiding research - Are patterns of rivalry predicted by strategic network membership? &#8211; is embedded in the United States Light Vehicles Industry, an industry not dominated by technological or regulatory imperatives. Further, rivalry is directly measured and utilised in research, thus distinguishing this investigation from prior research efforts. The timeframe of investigation is 1993 &#8211; 1999, with all research data derived from secondary sources. Strategic networks were defined within the United States Light Vehicles Industry based on evidence of horizontal strategic relationships between firms comprising the industry. The measure of rivalry used to directly ascertain the competitive patterns of industry participants was derived from the traditional Herfindahl Index, modified to account for patterns of rivalry observed at the market segment level. Statistical analyses of the strategic network and rivalry constructs found little evidence to support the contention of network rivalry; indeed, greater levels of rivalry were observed between firms comprising the same strategic network than between firms participating in opposing network structures. Based on these results, patterns of rivalry evidenced in the United States Light Vehicle Industry over the period 1993 &#8211; 1999 were not found to be predicted by strategic network membership. The findings generated by this research are in contrast to current theorising in the strategic network &#8211; rivalry realm. In this respect, these findings are surprising. The relevance of industry type, in conjunction with prevailing network methodology, provides the basis upon which these findings are contemplated. Overall, this study raises some important questions in relation to the relevancy of the network rivalry rationale, establishing a fruitful avenue for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategic networks, rivalry, network rivalry, collective rivalry, organizations, competition</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30331/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing hostile environments : journalists and media workers : learning to survive the world's difficult, remote and hostile environments</field><field name="creator">Filer, Shaun Matthew</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to examine the changing nature of risks that face journalists and media workers in the world's difficult, remote and hostile environments, and consider the 'adequacy' of managing hostile environment safety courses that some media organizations require prior to foreign assignments. The study utilizes several creative works and contributions to this area of analysis, which includes a documentary film production, course contributions, an emergency reference handbook, security and incident management reviews and a template for evacuation and contingency planning. 
 
 The research acknowledges that employers have a 'duty of care' to personnel working in these environments, identifies the necessity for pre-deployment training and support, and provides a solution for organizations that wish to initiate a comprehensive framework to advise, monitor, protect and respond to incidents. Finally, it explores the possible development of a unique and holistic service to facilitate proactive and responsive support, in the form of a new profession of 'Editorial Logistics Officer' or 'Editorial Safety Officer' within media organizations.
 
 This area of research is vitally important to the profession, and the intended contribution is to introduce a simple and cost-efficient framework for media organizations that desire to implement pre-deployment training and field-support &#8211; as these programs save lives. The complete proactive and responsive services may be several years from implementation.

He died in 1997 and left a large legacy of books and journal articles. This thesis traced the development of his thinking over the 46-year period from 1950 to 1995. It examined the 25 works authored, co-authored, edited, reissued and revised by him during that period. The writings were scrutinised using a literature research methodology to expose the theoretical content, and a history of thought lens to identify and account for the development of major ideas. The methodology enabled a gradual unfolding of the history. A broadly-consistent and sequential pattern of thought focusing on the notion of andragogy emerged. The study revealed that after the initial phases of exploratory thinking, Knowles developed a practical-theoretical framework he believed could function as a comprehensive theory of adult learning. As his thinking progressed, his theory developed into a unified framework for human resource development and, later, into a model for the development of self-directed lifelong learners. The study traced the development of Knowles&#8217; thinking through the phases of thought, identified the writings that belonged within each phase and produced a series of diagrammatic representations showing the evolution of his conceptual framework. The production of a history of the development of Knowles&#8217; thought is the major outcome of the study. In addition to plotting the narrative sequence of thought-events, the history helps to explicate the factors and conditions that influenced Knowles&#8217; thinking and to show the interrelationships between ideas. The study should help practitioners in their use and appreciation of Knowles&#8217; works.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adult education, adult learning, andragogy, contract learning, doctoral thesis, group dynamics, informal adult education, Knowles, leadership, leadership development, learning contracts, lifelong learning, Malcolm Knowles, pedagogy, self-directed learning</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30346/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conceptions of learning held by upper primary children in government shcools in Brunei Darussalam</field><field name="creator">Jaidin, Jainatul Halida</field><field name="description">The current study examined the conceptions of learning held by upper primary children in government schools in Brunei. Previous studies have shown that the conceptions of learning held by students influence the ways in which they approach learning tasks and, in turn, impact on their learning outcomes. However, the majority of these studies were carried out with university and secondary school students, with little research involving primary school children. A phenomenographic research approach was used to describe the qualitatively different ways in which a group of sixteen upper primary children experienced learning in two government schools in Brunei. Data were gathered using scenariobased semi&#129;]structured interviews. Iterative cycles of analysis revealed three categories of description depicting three qualitatively different ways in which the children experienced the phenomenon. The three categories of description were: learning as acquiring information (Category 1), learning as remembering information (Category 2) and learning as doing hands&#129;]on activities (Category 3). These categories indicate a variation in the ways in which upper primary children experience learning in government schools in Brunei.

While numerous studies have reported on the dynamics of aerosols indoors, the dynamics of bioaerosols in indoor environments are still poorly understood and very few studies have focused on fungal spore dynamics in indoor environments. Consequently, this work investigated the dynamics of fungal spores in indoor air, including fungal spore release and deposition, as well as investigating the mechanisms involved in the fungal spore fragmentation process. In relation to the investigation of fungal spore dynamics, it was found that the deposition rates of the bioaerosols (fungal propagules) were in the same range as the deposition rates of nonbiological particles and that they were a function of their aerodynamic diameters. It was also found that fungal particle deposition rates increased with increasing ventilation rates. These results (which are reported for the first time) are important for developing an understanding of the dynamics of fungal spores in the air. In relation to the process of fungal spore fragmentation, important information was generated concerning the airborne dynamics of the spores, as well as the part/s of the fungi which undergo fragmentation. The results obtained from these investigations into the dynamics of fungal propagules in indoor air significantly advance knowledge about the fate of fungal propagules in indoor air, as well as their deposition in the respiratory tract. The need to develop an advanced, real-time method for monitoring bioaerosols has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly as a result of the increased threat from biological weapons and bioterrorism. However, to date, the Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (UVAPS, Model 3312, TSI, St Paul, MN) is the only commercially available instrument capable of monitoring and measuring viable airborne micro-organisms in real-time. Therefore (for the first time), this work also investigated the ability of the UVAPS to measure and characterise fungal spores in indoor air. The UVAPS was found to be sufficiently sensitive for detecting and measuring fungal propagules. Based on fungal spore size distributions, together with fluorescent percentages and intensities, it was also found to be capable of discriminating between two fungal spore species, under controlled laboratory conditions. In the field, however, it would not be possible to use the UVAPS to differentiate between different fungal spore species because the different micro-organisms present in the air may not only vary in age, but may have also been subjected to different environmental conditions. In addition, while the real-time UVAPS was found to be a good tool for the investigation of fungal particles under controlled conditions, it was not found to be selective for bioaerosols only (as per design specifications). In conclusion, the UVAPS is not recommended for use in the direct measurement of airborne viable bioaerosols in the field, including fungal particles, and further investigations into the nature of the micro-organisms, the UVAPS itself and/or its use in conjunction with other conventional biosamplers, are necessary in order to obtain more realistic results. Overall, the results obtained from this work on airborne fungal particle dynamics will contribute towards improving the detection capabilities of the UVAPS, so that it is capable of selectively monitoring and measuring bioaerosols, for which it was originally designed. This work will assist in finding and/or improving other technologies capable of the real-time monitoring of bioaerosols. The knowledge obtained from this work will also be of benefit in various other bioaerosol applications, such as understanding the transport of bioaerosols indoors.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fungal spores, real-time monitoring, counting efficiency, spore release, air flow rate, culturing time, fluorescent percentage, spore size, fragments, air velocity, deposition rate, air exchange rates (AER), fungal particles, ventilation rate</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical analysis and reduction of multiple access interference in MC-CDMA systems</field><field name="creator">Li, Xuan</field><field name="description">Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) is a very promising candidate for the multiple access scheme in fourth generation wireless communi- cation systems. During asynchronous transmission, multiple access interference (MAI) is a major challenge for MC-CDMA systems and significantly affects their performance. The main objectives of this thesis are to analyze the MAI in asyn- chronous MC-CDMA, and to develop robust techniques to reduce the MAI effect. Focus is first on the statistical analysis of MAI in asynchronous MC-CDMA. A new statistical model of MAI is developed. In the new model, the derivation of MAI can be applied to different distributions of timing offset, and the MAI power is modelled as a Gamma distributed random variable. By applying the new statistical model of MAI, a new computer simulation model is proposed. This model is based on the modelling of a multiuser system as a single user system followed by an additive noise component representing the MAI, which enables the new simulation model to significantly reduce the computation load during computer simulations. MAI reduction using slow frequency hopping (SFH) technique is the topic of the second part of the thesis. Two subsystems are considered. The first sub- system involves subcarrier frequency hopping as a group, which is referred to as GSFH/MC-CDMA. In the second subsystem, the condition of group hopping is dropped, resulting in a more general system, namely individual subcarrier frequency hopping MC-CDMA (ISFH/MC-CDMA). This research found that with the introduction of SFH, both of GSFH/MC-CDMA and ISFH/MC-CDMA sys- tems generate less MAI power than the basic MC-CDMA system during asyn- chronous transmission. Because of this, both SFH systems are shown to outper- form MC-CDMA in terms of BER. This improvement, however, is at the expense of spectral widening. In the third part of this thesis, base station polarization diversity, as another MAI reduction technique, is introduced to asynchronous MC-CDMA. The com- bined system is referred to as Pol/MC-CDMA. In this part a new optimum com- bining technique namely maximal signal-to-MAI ratio combining (MSMAIRC) is proposed to combine the signals in two base station antennas. With the applica- tion of MSMAIRC and in the absents of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the resulting signal-to-MAI ratio (SMAIR) is not only maximized but also in- dependent of cross polarization discrimination (XPD) and antenna angle. In the case when AWGN is present, the performance of MSMAIRC is still affected by the XPD and antenna angle, but to a much lesser degree than the traditional maximal ratio combining (MRC). Furthermore, this research found that the BER performance for Pol/MC-CDMA can be further improved by changing the angle between the two receiving antennas. Hence the optimum antenna angles for both MSMAIRC and MRC are derived and their effects on the BER performance are compared. With the derived optimum antenna angle, the Pol/MC-CDMA system is able to obtain the lowest BER for a given XPD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistical analysis, multiple access interference, MC-CDMA systems</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30352/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building partnerships as a key strategy in developing an event management model for an international dance event : a case study of the 2008 WDA (World Dance Alliance) Global Summit, Brisbane, Australia</field><field name="creator">Liao, Shuyi</field><field name="description">With the increasing growth of cultural events both in Australia and internationally, there has also been an increase in event management studies; in theory and in practice. Although a series of related knowledge and skills required specifically by event managers has already been identified by many researchers (Perry et al., 1996; Getz, 2002 &amp; Silvers et al., 2006) and generic event management models proposed, including &#8216;project management&#8217; strategies in an event context (Getz, 2007), knowledge gaps still exist in relation to identifying specific types of events, especially for not-for-profit arts events. 
 For events of a largely voluntary nature, insufficient resources are recognised as the most challenging; including finance, human resources and infrastructure. Therefore, the concepts and principles which are adopted by large scale commercial events may not be suitable for not-for-profit arts events aiming at providing professional network opportunities for artists. Building partnerships are identified as a key strategy in developing an effective event management model for this type of event.

A related pursuit is the development of simple and efficient means for parallel manipulation and redistribution of adsorbed atoms, molecules and nanoparticles on surfaces &#8211; adparticle manipulation. These techniques will be used for the manufacture of nanoscale surface supported functional devices in nanotechnologies such as quantum computing, molecular electronics and lab-on-achip, as well as for modifying surfaces to obtain novel optical, electronic, chemical, or mechanical properties. A favourable approach to formation of surface nanostructures is self-assembly. In self-assembly, nanostructures are grown by aggregation of individual adparticles that diffuse by thermally activated processes on the surface. The passive nature of this process means it is generally not suited to formation of arbitrarily shaped structures. The self-assembly of nanostructures at arbitrary positions has been demonstrated, though these have typically required a pre-patterning treatment of the surface using sophisticated techniques such as electron beam lithography. On the other hand, a parallel adparticle manipulation technique would be suited for directing the selfassembly process to occur at arbitrary positions, without the need for pre-patterning the surface. There is at present a lack of techniques for parallel manipulation and redistribution of adparticles to arbitrary positions on the surface. This is an issue that needs to be addressed since these techniques can play an important role in nanotechnology. In this thesis, we propose such a technique &#8211; thermal tweezers. In thermal tweezers, adparticles are redistributed by localised heating of the surface. This locally enhances surface diffusion of adparticles so that they rapidly diffuse away from the heated regions. Using this technique, the redistribution of adparticles to form a desired pattern is achieved by heating the surface at specific regions. In this project, we have focussed on the holographic implementation of this approach, where the surface is heated by holographic patterns of interfering pulsed laser beams. This implementation is suitable for the formation of arbitrarily shaped structures; the only condition is that the shape can be produced by holographic means. In the simplest case, the laser pulses are linearly polarised and intersect to form an interference pattern that is a modulation of intensity along a single direction. Strong optical absorption at the intensity maxima of the interference pattern results in approximately a sinusoidal variation of the surface temperature along one direction. The main aim of this research project is to investigate the feasibility of the holographic implementation of thermal tweezers as an adparticle manipulation technique. Firstly, we investigate theoretically the surface diffusion of adparticles in the presence of sinusoidal modulation of the surface temperature. Very strong redistribution of adparticles is predicted when there is strong interaction between the adparticle and the surface, and the amplitude of the temperature modulation is ~100 K. We have proposed a thin metallic film deposited on a glass substrate heated by interfering laser beams (optical wavelengths) as a means of generating very large amplitude of surface temperature modulation. Indeed, we predict theoretically by numerical solution of the thermal conduction equation that amplitude of the temperature modulation on the metallic film can be much greater than 100 K when heated by nanosecond pulses with an energy ~1 mJ. The formation of surface nanostructures of less than 100 nm in width is predicted at optical wavelengths in this implementation of thermal tweezers. Furthermore, we propose a simple extension to this technique where spatial phase shift of the temperature modulation effectively doubles or triples the resolution. At the same time, increased resolution is predicted by reducing the wavelength of the laser pulses. In addition, we present two distinctly different, computationally efficient numerical approaches for theoretical investigation of surface diffusion of interacting adparticles &#8211; the Monte Carlo Interaction Method (MCIM) and the random potential well method (RPWM). Using each of these approaches we have investigated thermal tweezers for redistribution of both strongly and weakly interacting adparticles. We have predicted that strong interactions between adparticles can increase the effectiveness of thermal tweezers, by demonstrating practically complete adparticle redistribution into the low temperature regions of the surface. This is promising from the point of view of thermal tweezers applied to directed self-assembly of nanostructures. Finally, we present a new and more efficient numerical approach to theoretical investigation of thermal tweezers of non-interacting adparticles. In this approach, the local diffusion coefficient is determined from solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. The diffusion equation is then solved numerically using the finite volume method (FVM) to directly obtain the probability density of adparticle position. We compare predictions of this approach to those of the Ermak algorithm solution of the Langevin equation, and relatively good agreement is shown at intermediate and high friction. In the low friction regime, we predict and investigate the phenomenon of &#8216;optimal&#8217; friction and describe its occurrence due to very long jumps of adparticles as they diffuse from the hot regions of the surface.

Rural drivers are less compliant with recommendations regarding the &#8220;fatal four&#8221; behaviours of speeding, drink driving, seatbelt non-use and fatigue, and the reasons for their  lower apparent receptivity for road safety messages are not well understood.
 
 Countermeasures targeting driver behaviour that have been effective in reducing road crashes in urban areas have been less successful in rural areas (FORS, 1995).  However, potential barriers to receptivity for road safety information among rural road users have not been systematically investigated.
 
 This thesis aims to develop a road safety countermeasure that addresses three areas that potentially affect receptivity to rural road safety information.  The first is psychological barriers of road users&#8217; attitudes, including risk evaluation, optimism bias, locus of control and readiness to change.  A second area is the timing and method of intervention delivery, which includes the production of a brief intervention and the feasibility of delivering it at a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221;.  The third area under investigation is the content of the brief intervention.  This study describes the process of developing an intervention that includes content to address road safety attitudes and improve safety behaviours of rural road users regarding the &#8220;fatal four&#8221;.
 
 The research commences with a review of the literature on rural road crashes, brief interventions, intervention design and implementation, and potential psychological barriers to receptivity.  This literature provides a rationale for the development of a brief intervention for rural road safety with a focus on driver attitudes and behaviour.
 
 The research is then divided into four studies.  The primary aim of Study One and Study Two is to investigate the receptivity of rural drivers to road safety interventions, with a view to identifying barriers to the efficacy of these strategies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brief intervention, attitudes, rural, road safety, optimism bias, locus of control, risk perception, stage of change, teachable moment, alcohol, hospital, motorcycle</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30372/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peripheral ocular monochromatic aberrations</field><field name="creator">Mathur, Ankit</field><field name="description">Aberrations affect image quality of the eye away from the line of sight as well as along it. High amounts of lower order aberrations are found in the peripheral visual field and higher order aberrations change away from the centre of the visual field. Peripheral resolution is poorer than that in central vision, but peripheral vision is important for movement and detection tasks (for example driving) which are adversely affected by poor peripheral image quality. Any physiological process or intervention that affects axial image quality will affect peripheral image quality as well. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of accommodation, myopia, age, and refractive interventions of orthokeratology, laser in situ keratomileusis and intraocular lens implantation on the peripheral aberrations of the eye. This is the first systematic investigation of peripheral aberrations in a variety of subject groups. Peripheral aberrations can be measured either by rotating a measuring instrument relative to the eye or rotating the eye relative to the instrument. I used the latter as it is much easier to do. To rule out effects of eye rotation on peripheral aberrations, I investigated the effects of eye rotation on axial and peripheral cycloplegic refraction using an open field autorefractor. For axial refraction, the subjects fixated at a target straight ahead, while their heads were rotated by &#177;30&#186; with a compensatory eye rotation to view the target. For peripheral refraction, the subjects rotated their eyes to fixate on targets out to &#177;34&#176; along the horizontal visual field, followed by measurements in which they rotated their heads such that the eyes stayed in the primary position relative to the head while fixating at the peripheral targets. Oblique viewing did not affect axial or peripheral refraction. Therefore it is not critical, within the range of viewing angles studied, if axial and peripheral refractions are measured with rotation of the eye relative to the instrument or rotation of the instrument relative to the eye. Peripheral aberrations were measured using a commercial Hartmann-Shack aberrometer. A number of hardware and software changes were made. The 1.4 mm range limiting aperture was replaced by a larger aperture (2.5 mm) to ensure all the light from peripheral parts of the pupil reached the instrument detector even when aberrations were high such as those occur in peripheral vision. The power of the super luminescent diode source was increased to improve detection of spots passing through the peripheral pupil. A beam splitter was placed between the subjects and the aberrometer, through which they viewed an array of targets on a wall or projected on a screen in a 6 row x 7 column matrix of points covering a visual field of 42 x 32. In peripheral vision, the pupil of the eye appears elliptical rather than circular; data were analysed off-line using custom software to determine peripheral aberrations. All analyses in the study were conducted for 5.0 mm pupils. Influence of accommodation on peripheral aberrations was investigated in young emmetropic subjects by presenting fixation targets at 25 cm and 3 m (4.0 D and 0.3 D accommodative demands, respectively). Increase in accommodation did not affect the patterns of any aberrations across the field, but there was overall negative shift in spherical aberration across the visual field of 0.10 &#177; 0.01m. Subsequent studies were conducted with the targets at a 1.2 m distance. Young emmetropes, young myopes and older emmetropes exhibited similar patterns of astigmatism and coma across the visual field. However, the rate of change of coma across the field was higher in young myopes than young emmetropes and was highest in older emmetropes amongst the three groups. Spherical aberration showed an overall decrease in myopes and increase in older emmetropes across the field, as compared to young emmetropes. Orthokeratology, spherical IOL implantation and LASIK altered peripheral higher order aberrations considerably, especially spherical aberration. Spherical IOL implantation resulted in an overall increase in spherical aberration across the field. Orthokeratology and LASIK reversed the direction of change in coma across the field. Orthokeratology corrected peripheral relative hypermetropia through correcting myopia in the central visual field. Theoretical ray tracing demonstrated that changes in aberrations due to orthokeratology and LASIK can be explained by the induced changes in radius of curvature and asphericity of the cornea. This investigation has shown that peripheral aberrations can be measured with reasonable accuracy with eye rotation relative to the instrument. Peripheral aberrations are affected by accommodation, myopia, age, orthokeratology, spherical intraocular lens implantation and laser in situ keratomileusis. These factors affect the magnitudes and patterns of most aberrations considerably (especially coma and spherical aberration) across the studied visual field. The changes in aberrations across the field may influence peripheral detection and motion perception. However, further research is required to investigate how the changes in aberrations influence peripheral detection and motion perception and consequently peripheral vision task performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aberrations, peripheral refraction, ocular aberrations, peripheral aberrations, Hartmann-Shack aberrometry, orthokeratology, intraocular lens implantation, corneal refractive surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30384/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of teacher professional development based on the principles of lesson study</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Susan Ellen</field><field name="description">The researcher&#8217;s professional role as an Education Officer was the impetus for this study. Designing and implementing professional development activities is a significant component of the researcher&#8217;s position description and as a result of reflection and feedback from participants and colleagues, the creation of a more effective model of professional development became the focus for this study. Few studies have examined all three links between the purposes of professional development that is, increasing teacher knowledge, improving teacher practice, and improving student outcomes. This study is significant in that it investigates the nature of the growth of teachers who participated in a model of professional development which was based upon the principles of Lesson Study. The research provides qualitative and empirical data to establish some links between teacher knowledge, teacher practice, and student learning outcomes. 
 Teacher knowledge in this study refers to mathematics content knowledge as well as pedagogical-content knowledge. The outcomes for students include achievement outcomes, attitudinal outcomes, and behavioural outcomes. As the study was conducted at one school-site, existence proof research was the focus of the methodology and data collection. Developing over the 2007 school year, with five teacher-participants and approximately 160 students from Year Levels 6 to 9, the Lesson Study-principled model of professional development provided the teacher-participants with on-site, on-going, and reflective learning based on their classroom environment. The focus area for the professional development was strategising the engagement with and solution of worded mathematics problems. A design experiment was used to develop the professional development as an intervention of prevailing teacher practice for which data were collected prior to and after the period of intervention. A model of teacher change was developed as an underpinning framework for the development of the study, and was useful in making decisions about data collection and analyses. Data sources consisted of questionnaires, pre-tests and post-tests, interviews, and researcher observations and field notes.
 The data clearly showed that: content knowledge and pedagogical-content knowledge were increased among the teacher-participants; teacher practice changed in a positive manner; and that a majority of students demonstrated improved learning outcomes. The positive changes to teacher practice are described in this study as the demonstrated use of mixed pedagogical practices rather than a polarisation to either traditional pedagogical practices or contemporary pedagogical practices. The improvement in student learning outcomes was most significant as improved achievement outcomes as indicated by the comparison of pre-test and post-test scores. The effectiveness of the Lesson Study-principled model of professional development used in this study was evaluated using Guskey&#8217;s (2005) Five Levels of Professional Development Evaluation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lesson study, teacher professional development, problem solving, social constructivism, and student learning outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30389/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novella of ideas : how interactive new media art can effectively communicate an indigenous philosophical concept</field><field name="creator">Peacock, Christine</field><field name="description">How interactive new media art can effectively communicate an indigenous philosophical concept.  The sophistication and complexity of the philosophical concept concerning relationships between land and people and between people, intrinsic to the laws and customs of Australian Indigenous society, has begun to be communicated and accessed beyond the realm of anthropological and ethnological domains of Western scholarship. The exciting scope and rapid development of new media arts presents an innovative means of creating an interactive relationship with the general Australian public, addressing the urgent need for an understanding of Indigenous Australian concepts of relationship to land, and to each other, absent from Western narratives. The study is framed by an Indigenous concept of place, and relationships between land and people and between people; and explores how this concept can be clearly communicated through interactive new media arts. It involves: a creative project, the development of an interactive new media art project, a website work-in-progress titled site\sight\cite; and an exegesis, a Novella of Ideas, on the origins, influences, objectives, and potential of creative practices and processes engaged in the creative project. Research undertaken for the creative project and exegesis extended my creative practice into the use of interdisciplinary arts, expressly for the expression of philosophical concepts, consolidating 23 years experience in Indigenous community arts development. The creative project and exegesis contributes to an existing body of Indigenous work in a range of areas - including education, the arts and humanities - which bridges old and new society in Australia. In this study, old and new society is defined by the time of the initial production of art and foundations of knowledge, in the country of its origins, in Indigenous Australia dating back at least 40,000 years.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">philosophy, place theory, cultural theory, new media art, Indigenous arts practice, Indigenous practice-led research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30391/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein complementation assay as a display system for screening protein libraries in the intracellular environment</field><field name="creator">Pow, Andrew James</field><field name="description">A wide range of screening strategies have been employed to isolate antibodies and other proteins with specific attributes, including binding affinity, specificity, stability and improved expression. However, there remains no high-throughput system to screen for target-binding proteins in a mammalian, intracellular environment. Such a system would allow binding reagents to be isolated against intracellular clinical targets such as cell signalling proteins associated with tumour formation (p53, ras, cyclin E), proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders (huntingtin, betaamyloid precursor protein), and various proteins crucial to viral replication (e.g. HIV-1 proteins such as Tat, Rev and Vif-1), which are difficult to screen by phage, ribosome or cell-surface display. This study used the &#226;-lactamase protein complementation assay (PCA) as the display and selection component of a system for screening a protein library in the cytoplasm of HEK 293T cells. The colicin E7 (ColE7) and Immunity protein 7 (Imm7) Escherichia coli proteins were used as model interaction partners for developing the system. These proteins drove effective &#226;-lactamase complementation, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (9:1 &#8211; 13:1) comparable to that of other &#226;-lactamase PCAs described in the literature. The model Imm7-ColE7 interaction was then used to validate protocols for library screening. Single positive cells that harboured the Imm7 and ColE7 binding partners were identified and isolated using flow cytometric cell sorting in combination with the fluorescent &#226;-lactamase substrate, CCF2/AM. A single-cell PCR was then used to amplify the Imm7 coding sequence directly from each sorted cell. With the screening system validated, it was then used to screen a protein library based the Imm7 scaffold against a proof-of-principle target. The wildtype Imm7 sequence, as well as mutants with wild-type residues in the ColE7- binding loop were enriched from the library after a single round of selection, which is consistent with other eukaryotic screening systems such as yeast and mammalian cell-surface display. In summary, this thesis describes a new technology for screening protein libraries in a mammalian, intracellular environment. This system has the potential to complement existing screening technologies by allowing access to intracellular proteins and expanding the range of targets available to the pharmaceutical industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein complementation assay (PCA), &#226;-lactamase, two-hybrid, molecular display, protein libraries, intracellular proteins, library screening, high-throughput screening, mammalian expression system, flow cytometry, single cell sorting, CCF2/AM</field><field name="subject">nitrocefin, HEK 293, HEK 293T, biopharmaceuticals</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30392/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the permeability and compressibility of Australian bagasse pulp</field><field name="creator">Rainey, Thomas James</field><field name="description">This is an experimental study into the permeability and compressibility properties of bagasse pulp pads. Three experimental rigs were custom-built for this project. The experimental work is complemented by modelling work. Both the steady-state and dynamic behaviour of pulp pads are evaluated in the experimental and modelling components of this project. Bagasse, the fibrous residue that remains after sugar is extracted from sugarcane, is normally burnt in Australia to generate steam and electricity for the sugar factory. A study into bagasse pulp was motivated by the possibility of making highly value-added pulp products from bagasse for the financial benefit of sugarcane millers and growers. The bagasse pulp and paper industry is a multibillion dollar industry (1). Bagasse pulp could replace eucalypt pulp which is more widely used in the local production of paper products. An opportunity exists for replacing the large quantity of mainly generic paper products imported to Australia. This includes 949,000 tonnes of generic photocopier papers (2). The use of bagasse pulp for paper manufacture is the main application area of interest for this study. Bagasse contains a large quantity of short parenchyma cells called &#8216;pith&#8217;. Around 30% of the shortest fibres are removed from bagasse prior to pulping. Despite the &#8216;depithing&#8217; operations in conventional bagasse pulp mills, a large amount of pith remains in the pulp. Amongst Australian paper producers there is a perception that the high quantity of short fibres in bagasse pulp leads to poor filtration behaviour at the wet-end of a paper machine. Bagasse pulp&#8217;s poor filtration behaviour reduces paper production rates and consequently revenue when compared to paper production using locally made eucalypt pulp. Pulp filtration can be characterised by two interacting factors; permeability and compressibility. Surprisingly, there has previously been very little rigorous investigation into neither bagasse pulp permeability nor compressibility. Only freeness testing of bagasse pulp has been published in the open literature. As a result, this study has focussed on a detailed investigation of the filtration properties of bagasse pulp pads. As part of this investigation, this study investigated three options for improving the permeability and compressibility properties of Australian bagasse pulp pads. Two options for further pre-treating depithed bagasse prior to pulping were considered. Firstly, bagasse was fractionated based on size. Two bagasse fractions were produced, &#8216;coarse&#8217; and &#8216;medium&#8217; bagasse fractions. Secondly, bagasse was collected after being processed on two types of juice extraction technology, i.e. from a sugar mill and from a sugar diffuser. Finally one method of post-treating the bagasse pulp was investigated. The effects of chemical additives, which are known to improve freeness, were also assessed for their effect on pulp pad permeability and compressibility. Pre-treated Australian bagasse pulp samples were compared with several benchmark pulp samples. A sample of commonly used kraft Eucalyptus globulus pulp was obtained. A sample of depithed Argentinean bagasse, which is used for commercial paper production, was also obtained. A sample of Australian bagasse which was depithed as per typical factory operations was also produced for benchmarking purposes. The steady-state pulp pad permeability and compressibility parameters were determined experimentally using two purpose-built experimental rigs. In reality, steady-state conditions do not exist on a paper machine. The permeability changes as the sheet compresses over time. Hence, a dynamic model was developed which uses the experimentally determined steady-state permeability and compressibility parameters as inputs. The filtration model was developed with a view to designing pulp processing equipment that is suitable specifically for bagasse pulp. The predicted results of the dynamic model were compared to experimental data. The effectiveness of a polymeric and microparticle chemical additives for improving the retention of short fibres and increasing the drainage rate of a bagasse pulp slurry was determined in a third purpose-built rig; a modified Dynamic Drainage Jar (DDJ). These chemical additives were then used in the making of a pulp pad, and their effect on the steady-state and dynamic permeability and compressibility of bagasse pulp pads was determined. The most important finding from this investigation was that Australian bagasse pulp was produced with higher permeability than eucalypt pulp, despite a higher overall content of short fibres. It is thought this research outcome could enable Australian paper producers to switch from eucalypt pulp to bagasse pulp without sacrificing paper machine productivity. It is thought that two factors contributed to the high permeability of the bagasse pulp pad. Firstly, thicker cell walls of the bagasse pulp fibres resulted in high fibre stiffness. Secondly, the bagasse pulp had a large proportion of fibres longer than 1.3 mm. These attributes helped to reinforce the pulp pad matrix. The steady-state permeability and compressibility parameters for the eucalypt pulp were consistent with those found by previous workers. It was also found that Australian pulp derived from the &#8216;coarse&#8217; bagasse fraction had higher steady-state permeability than the &#8216;medium&#8217; fraction. However, there was no difference between bagasse pulp originating from a diffuser or a mill. The bagasse pre-treatment options investigated in this study were not found to affect the steady-state compressibility parameters of a pulp pad. The dynamic filtration model was found to give predictions that were in good agreement with experimental data for pads made from samples of pretreated bagasse pulp, provided at least some pith was removed prior to pulping. Applying vacuum to a pulp slurry in the modified DDJ dramatically reduced the drainage time. At any level of vacuum, bagasse pulp benefitted from chemical additives as quantified by reduced drainage time and increased retention of short fibres. Using the modified DDJ, it was observed that under specific conditions, a benchmark depithed bagasse pulp drained more rapidly than the &#8216;coarse&#8217; bagasse pulp.  In steady-state permeability and compressibility experiments, the addition of chemical additives improved the pad permeability and compressibility of a benchmark bagasse pulp with a high quantity of short fibres. Importantly, this effect was not observed for the &#8216;coarse&#8217; bagasse pulp. However, dynamic filtration experiments showed that there was also a small observable improvement in filtration for the &#8216;medium&#8217; bagasse pulp. The mechanism of bagasse pulp pad consolidation appears to be by fibre realignment. Chemical additives assist to lubricate the consolidation process. This study was complemented by pulp physical and chemical property testing and a microscopy study. In addition to its high pulp pad permeability, &#8216;coarse&#8217; bagasse pulp often (but not always) had superior physical properties than a benchmark depithed bagasse pulp.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugarcane, bagasse, pulp, paper, permeability, compressibility, filtration, Kozeny-Carman, drainage, forming, steady-state, dynamic, chemical additives, flocculants</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30394/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel system for the measurement of body shape and construction of seating supports for patients</field><field name="creator">Sattar, Imran</field><field name="description">Patients with severe back deformities can greatly benefit from customized medical seating.

Patients living in remote areas are severely affected by this as the clinics could be far away and inaccessible for these patients. To provide service of customized medical seating requires a new measurement system which is portable so that the system could be transported to the patients in remote areas.

As we enter the second decade of a new century, few would argue against the increasingly urgent need to integrate digital literacies with traditional academic knowledge. Yet, despite substantial investments from governments and businesses, the adoption and diffusion of contemporary digital tools in formal schooling remain sluggish. To date, research on technology adoption in schools tends to take a deficit perspective of schools and teachers, with the lack of resources and teacher &#8216;technophobia&#8217; most commonly cited as barriers to digital uptake. Corresponding interventions that focus on increasing funding and upskilling teachers, however, have made little difference to adoption trends in the last decade. Empirical evidence that explicates the cultural and pedagogical complexities of innovation diffusion within long-established conventions of mainstream schooling, particularly from the standpoint of students, is wanting. To address this knowledge gap, this thesis inquires into how students evaluate and account for the constraints and affordances of contemporary digital tools when they engage with them as part of their conventional schooling. It documents the attempted integration of a student-led Web 2.0 learning initiative, known as the Student Media Centre (SMC), into the schooling practices of a long-established, high-performing independent senior boys&#8217; school in urban Australia. The study employed an &#8216;explanatory&#8217; two-phase research design (Creswell, 2003) that combined complementary quantitative and qualitative methods to achieve both breadth of measurement and richness of characterisation. In the initial quantitative phase, a self-reported questionnaire was administered to the senior school student population to determine adoption trends and predictors of SMC usage (N=481). Measurement constructs included individual learning dispositions (learning and performance goals, cognitive playfulness and personal innovativeness), as well as social and technological variables (peer support, perceived usefulness and ease of use). Incremental predictive models of SMC usage were conducted using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) modelling: (i) individual-level predictors, (ii) individual and social predictors, and (iii) individual, social and technological predictors. Peer support emerged as the best predictor of SMC usage. Other salient predictors include perceived ease of use and usefulness, cognitive playfulness and learning goals. On the whole, an overwhelming proportion of students reported low usage levels, low perceived usefulness and a lack of peer support for engaging with the digital learning initiative. The small minority of frequent users reported having high levels of peer support and robust learning goal orientations, rather than being predominantly driven by performance goals. These findings indicate that tensions around social validation, digital learning and academic performance pressures influence students&#8217; engagement with the Web 2.0 learning initiative. The qualitative phase that followed provided insights into these tensions by shifting the analytics from individual attitudes and behaviours to shared social and cultural reasoning practices that explain students&#8217; engagement with the innovation. Six indepth focus groups, comprising 60 students with different levels of SMC usage, were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Textual data were analysed using Membership Categorisation Analysis. Students&#8217; accounts converged around a key proposition. The Web 2.0 learning initiative was useful-in-principle but useless-in-practice. While students endorsed the usefulness of the SMC for enhancing multimodal engagement, extending peer-topeer networks and acquiring real-world skills, they also called attention to a number of constraints that obfuscated the realisation of these design affordances in practice. These constraints were cast in terms of three binary formulations of social and cultural imperatives at play within the school: (i) &#8216;cool/uncool&#8217;, (ii) &#8216;dominant staff/compliant student&#8217;, and (iii) &#8216;digital learning/academic performance&#8217;. The first formulation foregrounds the social stigma of the SMC among peers and its resultant lack of positive network benefits. The second relates to students&#8217; perception of the school culture as authoritarian and punitive with adverse effects on the very student agency required to drive the innovation. The third points to academic performance pressures in a crowded curriculum with tight timelines.  Taken together, findings from both phases of the study provide the following key insights. First, students endorsed the learning affordances of contemporary digital tools such as the SMC for enhancing their current schooling practices. For the majority of students, however, these learning affordances were overshadowed by the performative demands of schooling, both social and academic. The student participants saw engagement with the SMC in-school as distinct from, even oppositional to, the conventional social and academic performance indicators of schooling, namely (i) being &#8216;cool&#8217; (or at least &#8216;not uncool&#8217;), (ii) sufficiently &#8216;compliant&#8217;, and (iii) achieving good academic grades. Their reasoned response therefore, was simply to resist engagement with the digital learning innovation. Second, a small minority of students seemed dispositionally inclined to negotiate the learning affordances and performance constraints of digital learning and traditional schooling more effectively than others. These students were able to engage more frequently and meaningfully with the SMC in school. Their ability to adapt and traverse seemingly incommensurate social and institutional identities and norms is theorised as cultural agility &#8211; a dispositional construct that comprises personal innovativeness, cognitive playfulness and learning goals orientation. The logic then is &#8216;both and&#8217; rather than &#8216;either or&#8217; for these individuals with a capacity to accommodate both learning and performance in school, whether in terms of digital engagement and academic excellence, or successful brokerage across multiple social identities and institutional affiliations within the school. In sum, this study takes us beyond the familiar terrain of deficit discourses that tend to blame institutional conservatism, lack of resourcing and teacher resistance for low uptake of digital technologies in schools. It does so by providing an empirical base for the development of a &#8216;third way&#8217; of theorising technological and pedagogical innovation in schools, one which is more informed by students as critical stakeholders and thus more relevant to the lived culture within the school, and its complex relationship to students&#8217; lives outside of school. It is in this relationship that we find an explanation for how these individuals can, at the one time, be digital kids and analogue students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning innovation, digital learning, online learning, information and communications technologies, virtual learning platforms, Web 2.0, new media technologies, social networking technologies, innovation adoption, innovation diffusion, technology uptake</field><field name="subject">technology use, schooling, senior schooling, education, Generation C, youths, young people, cognitive playfulness, cultural agility, multimodality, multiliteracies, classification and regression tree, membership categorisation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30396/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Granule-based knowledge representation for intra and inter transaction association mining</field><field name="creator">Yang, Wanzhong</field><field name="description">Abstract
 With the phenomenal growth of electronic data and information, there are many demands for the development of efficient and effective systems (tools) to perform the issue of data mining tasks on multidimensional databases. Association rules describe associations between items in the same transactions (intra) or in different transactions (inter). Association mining attempts to find interesting or useful association rules in databases: this is the crucial issue for the application of data mining in the real world. Association mining can be used in many application areas, such as the discovery of associations between customers&#8217; locations and shopping behaviours in market basket analysis. 
 Association mining includes two phases. The first phase, called pattern mining, is the discovery of frequent patterns. The second phase, called rule generation, is the discovery of interesting and useful association rules in the discovered patterns. The first phase, however, often takes a long time to find all frequent patterns; these also include much noise. The second phase is also a time consuming activity that can generate many redundant rules. 
 To improve the quality of association mining in databases, this thesis provides an alternative technique, granule-based association mining, for knowledge discovery in databases, where a granule refers to a predicate that describes common features of a group of transactions. The new technique first transfers transaction databases into basic decision tables, then uses multi-tier structures to integrate pattern mining and rule generation in one phase for both intra and inter transaction association rule mining. To evaluate the proposed new technique, this research defines the concept of meaningless rules by considering the co-relations between data-dimensions for intratransaction-association rule mining. It also uses precision to evaluate the effectiveness of intertransaction association rules. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is promising.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge discovery, knowledge representation, intratransaction association rule, intertransaction association rule, granule mining, multi-tier, association mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30398/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Near-infrared spectroscopic studies of human scalp hair in a forensic context</field><field name="creator">Brandes, Sarina</field><field name="description">Human hair is a relatively inert biopolymer and can survive through natural disasters. It is also found as trace evidence at crime scenes. Previous studies by FTIRMicrospectroscopy and &#8211; Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) successfully showed that hairs can be matched and discriminated on the basis of gender, race and hair treatment, when interpreted by chemometrics. However, these spectroscopic techniques are difficult to operate at- or on-field. On the other hand, some near infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) instruments equipped with an optical probe, are portable and thus, facilitate the on- or at &#8211;field measurements for potential application directly at a crime or disaster scene. This thesis is focused on bulk hair samples, which are free of their roots, and thus, independent of potential DNA contribution for identification. It explores the building of a profile of an individual with the use of the NIRS technique on the basis of information on gender, race and treated hair, i.e. variables which can match and discriminate individuals. The complex spectra collected may be compared and interpreted with the use of chemometrics. These methods can then be used as protocol for further investigations. Water is a common substance present at forensic scenes e.g. at home in a bath, in the swimming pool; it is also common outdoors in the sea, river, dam, puddles and especially during DVI incidents at the seashore after a tsunami. For this reason, the matching and discrimination of bulk hair samples after the water immersion treatment was also explored.  Through this research, it was found that Near Infrared Spectroscopy, with the use of an optical probe, has successfully matched and discriminated bulk hair samples to build a profile for the possible application to a crime or disaster scene. Through the interpretation of Chemometrics, such characteristics included Gender and Race. A novel approach was to measure the spectra not only in the usual NIR range (4000 &#8211; 7500 cm-1) but also in the Visible NIR (7500 &#8211; 12800 cm-1). This proved to be particularly useful in exploring the discrimination of differently coloured hair, e.g. naturally coloured, bleached or dyed. The NIR region is sensitive to molecular vibrations of the hair fibre structure as well as that of the dyes and damage from bleaching. But the Visible NIR region preferentially responds to the natural colourants, the melanin, which involves electronic transitions. This approach was shown to provide improved discrimination between dyed and untreated hair. This thesis is an extensive study of the application of NIRS with the aid of chemometrics, for matching and discrimination of bulk human scalp hair. The work not only indicates the strong potential of this technique in this field but also breaks new ground with the exploration of the use of the NIR and Visible NIR ranges for spectral sampling. It also develops methods for measuring spectra from hair which has been immersed in different water media (sea, river and dam)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">near-infrared spectroscopy, human hair, forensic science</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30399/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and diagnostics of fruit fly infesting Opiine Braconids in Australia and the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Amy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Opiine wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Opiinae) are parasitoids of dacine fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae), the primary horticultural pests of Australia and the South Pacific. Effective use of opiines for biological control of fruit flies is limited by poor taxonomy and identification difficulties. To overcome these problems, this thesis had two aims: (i) to carry out traditional taxonomic research on the fruit fly infesting opine braconids of Australia and the South Pacific; and (ii) to transfer the results of the taxonomic research into user friendly diagnostic tools. Curated wasp material was borrowed from all major Australian museum collections holding specimens. This was supplemented by a large body of material gathered as part of a major fruit fly project in Papua New Guinea: nearly 4000 specimens were examined and identified. Each wasp species was illustrated using traditional scientific drawings, full colour photomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. An electronic identification key was developed using Lucid software and diagnostic images were loaded on the web-based Pest and Diseases Image Library (PaDIL). A taxonomic synopsis and distribution and host records for each of the 15 species of dacine-parasitising opiine braconids found in the South Pacific is presented. Biosteres illusorius Fischer (1971) was formally transferred to the genus Fopius and a new species, Fopius ferrari Carmichael and Wharton (2005), was described. Other species dealt with were Diachasmimorpha hageni (Fullaway, 1952), D. kraussii (Fullaway, 1951), D. longicaudata (Ashmead, 1905), D. tryoni (Cameron, 1911), Fopius arisanus (Sonan, 1932), F. deeralensis (Fullaway, 1950), F. schlingeri Wharton (1999), Opius froggatti Fullaway (195), Psyttalia fijiensis (Fullaway, 1936), P. muesebecki (Fischer, 1963), P. novaguineensis (Sz&#233;pliget, 1900i) and Utetes perkinsi (Fullaway, 1950). This taxonomic component of the thesis has been formally published in the scientific literature. An interactive diagnostics package (&#8220;OpiineID&#8221;) was developed, the centre of which is a Lucid based multi-access key. Because the diagnostics package is computer based, without the space limitations of the journal publication, there is no pictorial limit in OpiineID and so it is comprehensively illustrated with SEM photographs, full colour photographs, line drawings and fully rendered illustrations. The identification key is only one small component of OpiineID and the key is supported by fact sheets with morphological descriptions, host associations, geographical information and images. Each species contained within the OpiineID package has also been uploaded onto the PaDIL website (www.padil.gov.au). Because the identification of fruit fly parasitoids is largely of concern to fruit fly workers, rather than braconid specialists, this thesis deals directly with an area of growing importance to many areas of pure and applied biology; the nexus between taxonomy and diagnostics. The Discussion chapter focuses on this area, particularly the opportunities offered by new communication and information tools as new ways delivering the outputs of taxonomic science.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Opiinae, Braconidae, Parasitoids, taxonomy, identification, diagnostics.</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30400/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and news making : a study of contemporary arabic television</field><field name="creator">Darwish, Ali</field><field name="description">Arabic satellite television has recently attracted tremendous attention in both the academic and professional worlds, with a special interest in Aljazeera as a curious phenomenon in the Arab region. Having made a household name for itself worldwide with the airing of the Bin Laden tapes, Aljazeera has set out to deliberately change the culture of Arabic journalism, as it has been repeatedly stated by its current General Manager Waddah Khanfar, and to shake up the Arab society by raising awareness to issues never discussed on television before and challenging long-established social and cultural values and norms while promoting, as it claims, Arab issues from a presumably Arab perspective. Working within the meta-frame of democracy, this Qatari-based network station has been received with mixed reactions ranging from complete support to utter rejection in both the west and the Arab world. This research examines the social semiotics of Arabic television and the socio-cultural impact of translation-mediated news in Arabic satellite television, with the aim to carry out a qualitative content analysis, informed by framing theory, critical linguistic analysis, social semiotics and translation theory, within a re-mediation framework which rests on the assumption that a medium &#8220;appropriates the techniques, forms and social significance of other media and attempts to rival or refashion them in the name of the real" (Bolter and Grusin, 2000: 66). This is a multilayered research into how translation operates at two different yet interwoven levels: translation proper, that is the rendition of discourse from one language into another at the text level, and translation as a broader process of interpretation of social behaviour that is driven by linguistic and cultural forms of another medium resulting in new social signs generated from source meaning reproduced as target meaning that is bound to be different in many respects. The research primarily focuses on the news media, news making and reporting at Arabic satellite television and looks at translation as a reframing process of news stories in terms of content and cultural values. This notion is based on the premise that by its very nature, news reporting is a framing process, which involves a reconstruction of reality into actualities in presenting the news and providing the context for it. In other words, the mediation of perceived reality through a media form, such as television, actually modifies the mind&#8217;s ordering and internal representation of the reality that is presented. The research examines the process of reframing through translation news already framed or actualized in another language and argues that in submitting framed news reports to the translation process several alterations take place, driven by the linguistic and cultural constraints and shaped by the context in which the content is presented. These alterations, which involve recontextualizations, may be intentional or unintentional, motivated or unmotivated. Generally, they are the product of lack of awareness of the dynamics and intricacies of turning a message from one language form into another. More specifically, they are the result of a synthesis process that consciously or subconsciously conforms to editorial policy and cultural interpretive frameworks. In either case, the original message is reproduced and the news is reframed. For the case study, this research examines news broadcasts by the now world-renowned Arabic satellite television station Aljazeera, and to a lesser extent the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) and Al- Arabiya where access is feasible, for comparison and crosschecking purposes. As a new phenomenon in the Arab world, Arabic satellite television, especially 24-hour news and current affairs, provides an interesting area worthy of study, not only for its immediate socio-cultural and professional and ethical implications for the Arabic media in particular, but also for news and current affairs production in the western media that rely on foreign language sources and translation mediation for international stories.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translation, media, news, Arabic television</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/30402/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#145;A Spirituality of silence&#146;

Amongst many scientific and biological applications, they have been   used to model crystallisation, vitrification, and particle interactions along with the use of colloidal model systems for the study of the fundamental nature of the fluid-crystal and fluid-glass phase transitions. It has been shown that colloidal particles can be trapped and manipulated using strongly-focused light beams known as optical tweezers, and this has paved the way for research into the area of micromanipulation using optical trapping. Holographic elements can replace multiple lenses in creating large numbers of optical tweezers and this is known as holographic optical trapping (HOT). A computer generated hologram can be designed to create large structured light fields, consisting of multiple foci, to enable trapping of multiple particles in arbitrary configurations.    The overall aim of this project was to design, develop and test the suitability of a simple, inexpensive optical trapping arrangement suitable for multiple optical trapping. To achieve this, a theoretically-exact expression for the wavefront of a single point source was implemented in the coding scheme, allowing for the fast creation of multiple point sources suitable for holographic optical trapping experiments.  Compensation for the spherical aberration present in the focusing optics was implemented into the coding scheme.   Kodalith photographic film was chosen as the holographic recording medium for its high contrast and availability. The film has proven to be a successful medium, when used to record photographically-reduced images of high-quality printouts of the computed diffraction pattern, as it was able to successfully reproduce complex light fields. It is believed that this will be the first time that this film has been implemented for optical trapping purposes. The main limitations concerning the performance of the holograms recorded on Kodalith were the phase nonuniformities caused by unevenness in the film thickness which resulted in a failure to separately resolve light traps separated by less than about 5 (Mu)m. Index matching of the film between sheets of flat glass helped to compensate for these limitations.       Holographic optical trapping was successfully observed using a variety of different initial beam powers, holographic aperture settings and light field configurations.  Trapping experiments on of two types of particles (PMMA and polystyrene) were successfully conducted, with as little as ~ 150 (Mu)W per trap being required for multiple polystyrene trapping. However, particles were weakly trapped and were easily dislodged at these powers, and a higher power per trap of around 1 mW is preferred. The use of a relatively low numerical aperture (NA) 50 mm SLR lens for focusing the holographic optical traps was successful, proving that optical trapping can be conducted without the use of high NA microscope-objective lenses commonly used in other set ups.       Holographic trapping of colloidal particles was successfully conducted at RMIT University for the first time proving the validity of the coding scheme, the recording method and the trapping arrangement.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colloids</field><field name="subject">Computer Generated Holograms</field><field name="subject">Holographic Optical Trapping</field><field name="subject">Numerical aperture</field><field name="subject">Optical Tweezers</field><field name="subject">Structured Light Fields</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100209.143544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The act of reflective practice; the emergence of iredale pedersen hook architects</field><field name="creator">Hook, Martyn Richard</field><field name="description">The Act of Reflective Practice explores the manner in which three individuals, young architects, came together and the manner in which their inherent value systems inform and determine the way they produce architecture. The research offers a systematic distillation of the common value systems behind the individuals who comprise iredale pedersen hook architects, identifying the particularity of each practitioner in terms of their expertise, experience and character within the collective and the situations from which the individuals have emerged. The PhD tracks the evolution of the practice and identification of its architecture through the RMIT Invitational Masters of Architecture by Project program and PhD by Project program, contextualizing the work through the establishment of a network of mentors and peers and ultimately locates the work locally, nationally and globally.       When introduced to the idea of the 'Reflective Practitioner', the architecture of iredale pedersen hook has taken a significant evolutionary step where the three individuals have begun to operate in a more cohesive manner and the inherent value system and concerns behind the work are now able to inform the future direction of the architecture. The research also explores how this shift has expand the character of the work and transform the manner in which the architecture is conceived, described and ultimately produced. Through the PhD and the accompanying Masters by my two practice partners and collaborators, Adrian Iredale and Finn Pedersen, the primary concerns embedded within our work have been isolated and a systematic but qualitative method developed that may assess the impact of these concerns across a selection of iredale pedersen hook projects.       The PhD defines a methodology, The Field of Concerns, by which the projects produced by iredale pedersen hook architects may be scrutinised and assessed in a qualitative framework, based on the agreed parameters and inherent value system underpinning the work.  The definition of the Field of Concerns is critical in the ability to establish an identity for each project and place it within the evolutionary output of the practice. Subsequent testing of the projects against the Concerns through the creation of spider diagrams enables the establishment of a visual process for evaluating the success of the projects against the aims of the practice and can be applied throughout the design process and upon completion. Together, the process of clarification, the questioning of our ability to claim authorship, and presence of all partners in each project may offer a qualitative framework for other 'Self-Curating Collectives' to establish criteria for exploring the evolution of their work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">Reflective Practice</field><field name="subject">Architectural Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100209.150125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a dynamic model of a ducted fan VTOL UAV</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Hui Wen</field><field name="description">The technology of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) has developed since its conception many years ago.

There were two main studies to achieve this aim.       The reliability and validity of the surface EMG signal to measure the activity of paraspinal muscles during maintenance of simple static postures was evaluated. During maintenance of static postures, the raw surface EMG signal was often contaminated by an electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. Although the ECG artefact was successfully removed using two different ECG removal techniques (manual and semi-automatic), the reliability of the surface EMG signal was not significantly improved (ICC less than 0.75) for both non-normalised and normalised data. Therefore the static postures that were used in this thesis did not provide a protocol that can be used to measure the functional status of the lumbar paraspinal muscles in clinical practice. However, when muscle contraction was at a moderate level, the reliability of EMG signal became better.      Walking was considered to be a possible protocol to record a reliable surface EMG signal from paraspinal muscles. Three components of the surface EMG signal were used to characterise the pattern of muscle activity during steady state walking. The narrow window technique was used to characterise the peak activation point of the activity envelope in order to capture a stationary signal from which to calculate amplitude and frequency measures. Walking is a cyclic activity. The back muscles contract rhythmically during a single gait cycle. It is possible to identify the start and end points of the activity envelope associated with the rhythmic contraction of the muscles and define the timing of the muscle activation cycle relative to heel strike. The metronome was found to be useful to control the pace of natural walking in this study. The surface EMG signal of the first recording minute (1 ~ 2 minute) was not associated with a signal that was stable in terms of the parameters that were used in this study. It wa s found that the last recording minute (9 ~ 10 minute) can be used. This suggests that it may be necessary for subjects to walk for a defined period lasting some minutes before the commencement of recording of the surface EMG.       Surface EMG may be used as a tool to measure activation patterns of the low back muscles during muscle contraction associated with the support of various static postures or during the execution of dynamic movements such as walking in the real world. The static postures used in this thesis to record the surface EMG signal from the lumbar paraspinal muscles were found not to provide the basis for a reliable and valid tool. However, a walking exercise might be an alternative activity which can be used easily in clinical practice. The components of the surface EMG signal that may be used in future studies might include measures of the amplitude, frequency and timing of the surface EMG signal.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Electrocardiography</field><field name="subject">Static posture</field><field name="subject">Walking</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Lumbar paraspinal muscle</field><field name="subject">ECG removal</field><field name="subject">Gait</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">Stationary signal</field><field name="subject">Trunk</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100210.145414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient supply and habitat specificity of the rare mycoheterotrophic underground orchid, Rhizanthella gardneri</field><field name="creator">Bougoure, Jeremy J.</field><field name="description">Rhizanthella gardneri (Rogers) is a critically endangered orchid restricted to two isolated regions of south-western Australia. Rhizanthella gardneri is an entirely subterranean mycoheterotrophic species that purportedly forms a tripartite relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus (Ceratobasidiales) that links with an autotrophic shrub of the Melaleuca uncinata complex to acquire nutrients. Whether the rarity of R. gardneri is intrinsic is overshadowed by the recent effect of extrinsic factors that means R. gardneri requires some form of conservation and may also be a viable candidate for restoration. To create an integrated conservation strategy for R. gardneri, reasons for its decline and knowledge of its biological and ecological functioning must be elucidated. This thesis focuses on three key questions; 1) what are the habitat requirements and limitations to R. gardneri survival; 2) what is the identity and specificity of the fungus R. gardneri forms mycorrhizas with; and 3) does R. gardneri form a nutrient-sharing tripartite relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus and autotrophic shrub. Key climate, soil and vegetation characteristics of known R. gardneri habitats were quantified to provide baseline data for monitoring known R. gardneri populations, to better understand how R. gardneri interacts with its habitat, and to identify possible new sites for R. gardneri introduction. Habitats of the two known R. gardneri populations differed considerably in soil chemistry, Melaleuca structure and Melaleuca productivity. Individual sites within populations were relatively similar in all attributes measured while overall Northern and Southern habitats were distinct from each other. These results suggest that R. gardneri can tolerate a range of conditions and may be more widespread than previously thought, given that there are extensive areas of Melaleuca thickets with similar habitat characteristics across south-western Australia. The fungus forming mycorrhizas with R. gardneri was identified, using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, as a Rhizoctonia-type fungus within the Ceratobasidiales. All fungi isolated from R. gardneri individuals representative of its currently known distribution were genetically similar, suggesting R. gardneri is highly dependent on this specific fungal species. Given that R. gardneri appears to exclusively associate with a specific fungal species, species-specific molecular primers were designed and used to analyse the fungi&#146;s presence in known and potential R. gardneri habitats. These results 6 suggest that the fungus exists beyond the known R. gardneri habitats and gives hope to finding new populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri -- Conservation -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri -- Nutrition -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi -- Conservation -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Melaleuca -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri</field><field name="subject">Underground orchid</field><field name="subject">Orchid mycorrhiza</field><field name="subject">Plant conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of potential spudcan punch-through failure on sand overlying clay soils</field><field name="creator">Lee, Kok Kuen</field><field name="description">When a jack-up foundation is installed on seabeds consisting of a sand layer overlying soft clay, potential for 'punch-through' failure exists. This happens due to an abrupt reduction in bearing resistance when the foundation punches a block of sand into the underlying soft clay in an uncontrolled manner. This can lead to a sudden large penetration that can cause temporary decommissioning and even toppling of the unit. This research has addressed this problem with the aim of developing a practical design method for the jack-up industry to assess potential punch-through hazards. This objective has been achieved with the successful development of a new conceptual model for predicting the peak penetration resistance and a consistent method for constructing a complete resistance profile of spudcan foundations penetrating through sand into the underlying clay. The analytical basis of the new conceptual model follows the approach for silo analysis, and takes into account the stress level and dilatant response of sand. It is therefore a significant improvement over the punching shear and load spread models recommended in the current industry guidelines SNAME (2002), which do not consider the strength properties of the sand. To provide relevant experimental data for the new model, an extensive series of 30 continuous penetration tests were performed using the UWA drum centrifuge. These experimental results were retrospectively simulated using finite element (FE) analysis, in order to back-calculate the stress-level dependent friction and dilation angles in the sand during peak penetration resistance. The back-analysis showed that larger values of peak resistance gave lower friction and dilation angles, which is consistent with gradual suppression of dilatancy under high confining stress. When compared to published results from visualisation experiments, the FE analysis showed a similar failure mechanism during peak resistance, where a frustum of sand was forced into the underlying clay, with the outer angle reflecting the dilation in the sand. This has formed the basis of the new conceptual model. The performance of the new model in predicting the experimental peak resistance was compared with other existing analytical methods. Additional experimental results, including those already in the literature, were incorporated in the comparative study. It was found that the new conceptual model generally gave a good prediction of the experimental values, while the prediction from SNAME (2002) was conservative, with the predicted values being about half the experimental results on average. It was also shown that the new model could be modified to predict the post-peak penetration resistance in the sand layer. Finally, an analytical method for predicting the resistance profiles in the underlying clay was devised based on new bearing capacity factors developed through FE analysis. By joining the values of peak resistance, post-peak resistance and the resistance profile in the underlying clay, a complete simplified penetration resistance profile for spudcan foundations in sand overlying clay can be generated. The predicted profiles were shown to match the experimental results well.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centrifugation</field><field name="subject">Clay</field><field name="subject">Foundations</field><field name="subject">Sandy soils</field><field name="subject">Soil-structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Centrifuge modelling</field><field name="subject">Bearing capacity</field><field name="subject">Conceptual model</field><field name="subject">Sand over clay</field><field name="subject">Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership and career aspirations in female and male middle managers : a cross-cultural study in Malaysia and Australia</field><field name="creator">Jogulu, Uma</field><field name="description">Western research dominates in areas of theories and models which describe organisational behaviours, human resource management and workplace participation. However the 21st century brings new challenges. Findings to-date suggest that attitudes and values are strongly culture specific therefore many facets now require re-thinking by human resource specialists and organisational behavioural theorists. For instance, the globalisation of the market economy has dramatically changed the contemporary business environment. As a direct consequence of the globalisation process, the nature of organisational structures and workforce diversity has also changed. Such changes may make the application of Western theories less relevant to explain behaviours and attitudes of contemporary employees around the world. Therefore, there is a need for expanding our cross-cultural understanding in order to provide practical knowledge to enhance people and business management so that organisations can remain successful nationally and internationally. Comparative cross-cultural studies are required to expand on Western theories and models. The present study acknowledged and regarded the importance of cross-cultural studies to date, and endeavoured to expand on the extant knowledge by providing specific information relating to two diverse countries. The aim of the research project is to examine two measurable areas of organisational behaviours namely leadership styles and managerial career aspirations of female and male managers in Malaysia and Australia to explore the similarities and differences between the groups. The study found differences within and between female and male managers in Malaysia and Australia in terms of leadership styles, perception of effectiveness, perceptions towards managerial career aspirations and perceived promotion opportunities during the quantitative and qualitative data collection stages. The study concludes by providing empirical evidence to refute the universality of Western theories and models in all cultures. The analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data revealed significant differences in terms of values, behaviours and attitudes of managers in the two diverse cultures which have important implications for work and employment. This suggests that Western theories and models of organisational behaviour and workplace participation are not universally applicable, appropriate or relevant in all cultural environments. Implications for theory and practice in the light of an enhanced cross-cultural understanding were recommended.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/16287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work/life balance through a critical &#8216;gender lens&#8217;: A cross-country comparison of parental leave provisions and take-up in Australia and Sweden</field><field name="creator">Zacharias, Nadine</field><field name="description">Work/life balance researchers have documented the low take-up rates of corporate work/life balance policies at the same time as there are reports of persistent work/life pressures. This research aims to provide more comprehensive explanations of the phenomenon of low policy take-up than those currently available in the work/life balance literature which focus on organisational and individual factors. The research project is based on a critical review of the work/life balance literature which focuses on organisational solutions and starts from the assumption that the organisational approach to researching and addressing work/life conflicts is inherently limited, mainly because it does not theorise gender as a social structure and does not take into consideration the social and political context in which work/life arrangements are negotiated but focuses, instead, on individual employees and organisations. I integrated my critical review of the organisational work/life balance literature with concepts in the feminist literature, most importantly the gendered public/private divide, to create an explicit &#8216;gender lens&#8217; which guides the interpretations of my findings. I applied this gender lens to Habermas&#8217; model of societal evolution to operationalise it as an analytical tool for this research. From this theoretical basis, I designed a comparative research project, using Australia and Sweden as country case studies, which compares the approaches to work/life balance in the two countries. The focus of the analysis is on parental leave as one important example of work/life balance policies. The data for this research includes the parental leave legislation, public documents released by governments and associated bodies as well as national surveys on the take-up of parental leave provisions in both countries. This material is analysed in the light of the conceptual framework.

I have cast a line of inquiry into eastern, western and primitive art practices, observing the journey of chance accelerated by developments in technology. Traditionally artists utilized modes of spatial convention and techniques according to the specific cultural traditions of the time and place of their production. By contrast, contemporary artists know no such boundaries, and are able to select from a range of spatial options relevant both to current forms of expression and to a personal visual language. My own art practice has been enriched and extended, increasing my ability to challenge the notion of still life composition by reversing the traditional hierarchy of form and space through the application of a series of experiments brought about by extensive research into this spatial evolution. The research project has further assisted this development in my art practice by engaging me in a new level of understanding of the topic, informing my perceptions and increasing my ability to translate a combination of forms in space with heightened emotion and personal meaning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Composition</field><field name="subject">Spatialism</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/16226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing factoid question answering using frame semantic-based approaches</field><field name="creator">Ofoghi, Bahadorreza</field><field name="description">FrameNet is used to enhance the performance of semantic QA systems.

In certain cases, for example, when objective functions and constraints are convex, it is possible to construct a feasible algorithm for solving global optimization problem successfully. Convexity, however, is not a phenomenon to be often expected in the applications. Nonconvex problems frequently arise in many industrial and scienti&#175;c areas. Therefore, it is only natural to try to replace convexity with some other structure at least for some classes of nonconvex optimization problems to render the global optimization problem feasible. A theory of abstract convexity has been developed as a result of the above considerations. Monotonic analysis, a branch of abstract convex analysis, is analogous in many ways to convex analysis, and sometimes is even simpler. It turned out that many problems of nonconvex optimization encountered in applications can be described in terms of monotonic functions. The analogies with convex analysis were considered to aid in solving some classes of nonconvex optimization problems. In this thesis we will focus on one of the elements of monotonic analysis - Increasing Positively Homogeneous functions of degree one or in short IPH functions. The aim of present research is to show that finding the solution and &#178;-approximation to the solution of the global optimization problem for IPH functions restricted to a unit simplex is an NP-hard problem. These results can be further extended to positively homogeneous functions of degree &#180;, &#180; &gt; 0.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical optimization</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/16160</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ship of Fools</field><field name="creator">Collins, Julie</field><field name="description">The Ship of Fools is an ancient allegory that has long been a part of Western culture in literature, art and song...

The research evolved out of a portal development consultancy. The aim of the study was two-fold: to investigate the nature of the change process when a collaborative network seeks to adopt e-commerce; and to determine how the change process differed in the face of incremental change (adding some e-commerce solutions to the network), or radical change (changing the overall business model). The purpose of the study was to gain a better understanding of the economic, strategic and social potential of regional business networks in the current techno-economic climate. The study builds on Rogers' (1995) seminal work on the diffusion of innovations and makes a unique contribution to existing diffusion studies by its focus on the nature of the network links as the unit of analysis; and by its application of an action-oriented methodology to untangle the effects of the embedded network structure on diffusion. The study suggests a strong relationship between diffusion and network positioning, both in terms of place (status and position in the network) and space (the geographic make-up of the network). Diffusion further hinged on network cohesion, actors' trust in and engagement with the network. Adoption of e-commerce was obstructed by actors&#8217; worldview; lack of time, reflexive learning, and commitment to change. The incorporation in the study&#8217;s diffusion framework of contextual moderators such as network position, worldview, trust, time and commitment considerably extends Rogers&#8217; traditional diffusion framework. Based on its emergent analysis framework, the study introduces a dynamic change model towards sustainable regional network development. It is suggested that both the diffusion framework and the regional innovation model developed in this study may, either jointly or separately, be applicable beyond the tourism and service sector.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sacred landscape : an unsettling</field><field name="creator">Whitson, Robert</field><field name="description">"This project is concerned with a visual exploration of the land of the Western Plains of Victoria and the nature of "the sacred" in that landscape.

It is intensively being studied and different classification techniques and algorithms have been developed. This thesis focuses on classification of online documents that has become more critical with the development of World Wide Web. The WWW vastly increases the availability of on-line documents in digital format and has highlighted the need to classify them. From this background, we have noted the emergence of &#8220;automatic Web Classification&#8221;. These mainly concentrate on classifying HTML-like documents into classes or categories by not only using the methods that are inherited from the traditional Text Classification process, but also utilizing the extra information provided only by Web pages. Our work is based on the fact that, Web documents, contain not only ordinary features (words) but also extra information, such as meta-data and hyperlinks that can be used to advantage the classification process. The aim of this research is to study various ways of using the extra information, in particularly, hyperlink information provided by HTML-documents (Web pages). The merit of the approach, developed in this thesis, is its simplicity, compared with existing approaches. We present different approaches of using hyperlink information to improve the effectiveness of web classification. Unlike other work in this area, we will only use the mappings between linked documents and their own class or classes. In this case, we only need to add a few features called linked-class features into the datasets, and then apply classifiers on them for classification. In the numerical experiments we adopted two wellknown Text Classification algorithms, Support Vector Machines and BoosTexter. The results obtained show that classification accuracy can be improved by using mixtures of ordinary and linked-class features. Moreover, out-links usually work better than in-links in classification. We also analyse and discuss the reasons behind this improvement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HTML</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Support Vector Machines</field><field name="subject">BoosTexter</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into Suiboku and Kano School influences on Rococo and Romantic landscape painting through Claude Lorraine (1600-1682) and Salvator Rosa (1615-1673)</field><field name="creator">Woodger, Jeff Robert</field><field name="description">"This research project examines the impact and influence of Chinese and Japanese ink landscape painting on the genre of Grand Manner Classical and Romantic landscape painting in Europe, from its beginnings as an independent genre in the 17th century.

The work conveys the story of my life at this locale and pursues the motives behind the purchase of the country property, the experiences and remembrances that exist from this period of time and reflects upon the implications of a way of life over the last three decades. While considering the impact that a landscape can have on individual lives, it became important to consolidate the insights that surfaced for me with respect to my own life and works and compare it with that of other selected landscape artists. This comparison took into account personal and family backgrounds, artistic techniques, relationships with the land and the motivations that resulted in the depiction of particular landscapes. The result of these observations led to a consideration that not only can a landscape define the way in which we live our lives but, also identifies an affinity between human beings and the environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Rural life</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Biography</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalist telephone counselling and referral call data as a social indicator : a lifeline to social support?</field><field name="creator">Watson, Robert</field><field name="description">The aim of this Australian Research Council Linkage doctoral project with industry partners UnitingCare-Lifeline Ballarat and Lifeline Australia was to investigate whether calls to Lifeline &#8211; a generalist telephone counselling and referral service &#8211; could be used as valid and reliable social indicators of health. The Lifeline Australia service receives approximately 1,000 calls a day and key details of each call are recorded on its Client Services Management Information System (CSMIS). A number of research questions directed this study: (1) What are the characteristics or attributes of callers to Lifeline?; (2) How do the patterns of calls to Lifeline vary spatially?; and (3) What is the statistical relationship between calls to Lifeline and other measures of community health? This thesis presents a detailed descriptive summary and analysis of Lifeline&#8217;s national CSMIS call data (N = 90,128 cases) from 01-04-2003 to 29-06-2003. It explores this and other sources of call data, such as the Telstra Exchange data, for their potential to be used as social indicators. The project created a model of generalist telephone counselling and referral use (MGTCRU). The MGTCRU was used as a theoretical base to a call rate indicator, named the Lifeline Indicator of Social Need (LISN), which reflects the community&#8217;s capacity to provide social support to its most socially isolated residents. The LISN was found to have useful attributes and a potential for use as a social indicator of community strength. The call rate indicator showed a statistically significant relationship with the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia, measures of socio-economic disadvantage, and suicide rates. However, the CSMIS database was found to have certain limitations. The thesis presents recommendations for this situation to be addressed. While acknowledging that there are limitations to telephone counselling call data it is clear that these call data can be used to create cost effective, rapid, reliable, and potentially valid social indicators. This thesis has made a number of significant empirical and theoretical contributions to knowledge on telephone counselling and referral. The descriptive summary of the CSMIS data provided in this thesis might be used in innovative ways by social researchers. The LISN could be used on its own or included in other social indices. The MGTCRU provides a theoretical framework for understanding telephone counselling and referral services use and may assist these services to organise their operations and meet the needs of their callers. This project may have particular application to a current upgrade of Lifeline Australia&#8217;s telephony and call data systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselling</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Social service</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complemented and uncomplemented subspaces of Banach spaces</field><field name="creator">Vuong, Thi Minh Thu</field><field name="description">"A natural process in examining properties of Banach spaces is to see if a Banach space can be decomposed into simpler Banach spaces; in other words, to see if a Banach space has complemented subspaces.

Ten competitive triathletes (mean peak oxygen consumption, VO2 peak = 65.5 &#177; 5.5 ml.kg.-1min-1) undertook two simulated Olympic Distance Triathlons in 31&#176; C and 61% relative humidity. The trials were split into two work phases: a fixed workload phase comprising a 18-20 min swim and a 60 min cycle and, a self regulated time trial run over 10 kilometres conducted on a treadmill. One hundred and fifty min prior each trial, either a glycerol solution (1 g.kg.-1 body mass (BM) in a 4% carbohydrate &#8211; electrolyte drink) or a placebo of equal volume of the 4% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution was ingested over one hour. The total fluid intake in each trial was 23 ml.kg.-1 BM. A randomised, double blind, cross over design was used. Due to either 1) the arduous nature of the trials 2) the side effects associated with the ingestion of glycerol 3) or the combination of the two aforementioned reasons, only five of the 10 subjects completed the final 10 km self regulated time trial for both treatments. Only the data obtained from these five subjects were reported in this study. Glycerol ingestion expanded body water over the placebo by 154 ml (26%). At 60 and 90 min after the start of drinking, urine output was significantly higher with glycerol than placebo treatment (216.4, 366.4 ml vs 81.0, 242.0 ml, respectively) but significantly higher at 120 min in the placebo (421.6 ml vs 131.2 ml). There were no significant differences in heart rate and rectal temperature during the swim and cycle phases. However, there were significant increases in heart rate (at 5, 10, 15, 25 and 30 min) and rectal temperature (at 5, 20 and 30 min) during the 10 km run in the glycerol trial. The mean 10 km run time for the placebo trial was 40 min 21 sec (&#177; 2.9 min) while the glycerol trial was 39 min 22 sec (&#177; 2.0 min). The mean difference of 2.1% in finishing time between trials was not significant. Three of the five subjects in the glycerol trial improved their 10 km time by 7.0, 2.4 and 2.7%, respectively. The finishing time for one subject did not change for both trials while another subject had deteriorated by 2.3% in the glycerol trial. In the glycerol treatment, five subjects complained of bloating and nausea while only one subject complained of feeling unwell in the placebo treatment. Data from this study have shown that glycerol hyperhydration did not significantly improve performance while plasma volume expansion and subsequent lower rectal temperature and lower heart rates were not evident. The exact mechanisms of how glycerol hyperhydration can improve performance warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water-electrolyte balance</field><field name="subject">Triathlon</field><field name="subject">Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Athletes</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Very low frequency - Magnetic spatial position detection range and map</field><field name="creator">Poplawski, Jaroslaw</field><field name="description">Automated positioning systems designed to measure three-dimensional locations of objects are of paramount importance to flexible manufacturing applications.

The study focussed on engineering students as future business leaders and designers of working environments. An instrument was designed to examine the ability of OH&amp;S education to affect decision-making and problem solving competence in engineering students and graduates. The study found that engineering graduates in the 1990's were departing [from] their academic institutions with superficial knowledge of occupational health and safety responsibilities and accountability in the workplace. The evaluative tool identified an absence of safety management skills and knowledge within graduate and student engineer groups and an extensive urge to blame and discipline the victim or blame a government regulatory authority. The research found that although occupational health and safety professionals adopt a strategy of a safe work place rather than place emphasis on individual workers the engineers did not adopt the safe place approach and focussed on the person. It is recommended that the evaluative tool or a derivative of it should be used to evaluate the extent to which our community progresses in developing the vital OHS decision-making skills of the people who will manage and design workplaces." --p.ii.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineers</field><field name="subject">Industrial safety</field><field name="subject">OHS</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Graphs and subgraphs with bounded degree</field><field name="creator">Teska, Jakub</field><field name="description">"The topology of a network (such as a telecommunications, multiprocessor, or local area network, to name just a few) is usually modelled by a graph in which vertices represent 'nodes' (stations or processors) while undirected or directed edges stand for 'links' or other types of connections, physical or virtual.

The problem of the existence of a hamiltonian cycle is closely related to the well known problem of a travelling salesman. These problems are NP-complete and NP-hard, respectively. While some necessary and sufficient conditions are known, to date, no practical characterization of hamiltonian graphs has been found. There are several ways to generalize the notion of a hamiltonian cycle.

But corporate governance theories (Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976) and business strategy theories (Barton &amp; Gordon, 1988) suggest that ownership structure and ownership concentration, product diversification and asset specificity may also influence capital structure. Focusing on the examination of the determinants of capital structure in Chinese listed companies, this research goes beyond financial factors and considered business strategy and corporate governance approaches, and their impact on capital structure, in a transitioning Chinese context where institutions, expertise and regulatory processes are different to, but converging on, Western approaches. A panel data set of 1,098 Chinese listed companies for the period of 1991 to 2000 was collected from published sources, and conventional and innovative econometric methodologies were used to model a range of relationships between capital structure and its financial and non-financial determinants. The statistical approaches used in this study included Ordinary Least Squares Model and also Linear Mixed Model, which is a powerful tool to examine panel data where independence of explanatory variables is not assumed. The analysis also involved Hox&#8217;s model building procedures to measure model fit. The capital structure of listed companies in both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Securities Exchange is positively related to a firm&#8217;s tax rate, growth and capital intensity and negatively related to a firm&#8217;s profit and size. Other financial factors such as tangibility, risk and duration are non-significant. The capital structure of listed companies, particularly in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, is positively related to product diversification and negatively related to asset specificity. The capital structure of listed companies in the Shanghai Securities Exchange is positively related to government ownership and ownership concentration of the largest shareholder and negatively related to legal person ownership and ownership concentration of the ten largest shareholders. The data and modelling support financial and non-financial determinants of capital structure. In particular, information asymmetry, business diversity and asset specificity have a significant impact on capital structure. In addition the empirical work in the study supports agency cost explanations of debt and equity. Finally the research demonstrates that the two main financial markets in China, Shenzhen and Shanghai, have operated differently but are converging towards a common norm. The research contributes to the general field of capital structure and provides valuable insights into the nature of the Chinese firm and the evolution of the Chinese financial system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">Finance</field><field name="subject">Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stock market predictions based on quantified intermarket influences</field><field name="creator">Tilakaratne, Chandima</field><field name="description">This research investigated the feasibility and capability of neural network-based approaches for predicting the direction of the Australian Stock market index (the target market).

Donaldson's fantasies are dominated by male protagonists, one of whom is a leper while the others are rapists or murderers or else engaged in some form of violence or sexual perversion. This thesis not only offers an interpretation for this representation of disease and gross physical abuse, but also looks to the implication such corporeality brings to bear on the amatory relationships that the novels attempt to establish. "The thesis is organized into three broad sections. The first considers the ways in which the concept of the mother manifests in Donaldson's text and how the male protagonists respond to the maternal dynamic established in these books. [...] The second section of the thesis examines the role played by Donaldson's father figures.

Recently, Bailey and McLaren (2005) developed and tested a model which investigated the relationships between engagement in various leisure activities performed alone or with others, sense of belonging, depression, and suicidal ideation. The present study examined an extended version of the mental health model, incorporating the additional variables of perceived freedom in leisure and physical health status. A sample of Australian males and females (N = 379) aged 65 years and over (M age = 77.23, SD = 7.48) completed the Perceived Freedom in Leisure Questionnaire, the Yale Physical Activity Survey,the Duke Health Profile, the Sense of Belonging Instrument, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depressive Scale, and the Suicide Subscale of the General Health Questionnaire. Results indicated that the model was invariant for gender, and accounted for 56% of the variance in suicidal ideation. The model indicated that physical health had direct relationships with each variable in the model. Perceived freedom in leisure predicted engagement in physical activity, sense of belonging-antecedent, and depression, whereas sense of belonging psychological state predicted depression and suicidal ideation. Results suggest that interventions aimed at improving older adults&#8217; perceptions of freedom and personal choice with regard to their leisure experiences, maintaining optimal health, and increasing opportunities to foster feelings of belonging and relatedness with others, should protect against the development of mental ill health.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clinical psychology</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Suicide</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial modelling of the relationship between respiratory admissions and ambient air pollution</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Dora</field><field name="description">"The aims of this research were to investigate the association between air pollution and respiratory health effects using a spatial approach, and to derive a composite indicator of ambient air pollution."</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air pollution</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Respiratory health</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of arsenic and heavy metals in soils and surface waters in Central Victoria (Ballarat, Creswick and Maldon)</field><field name="creator">Sultan, Khawar</field><field name="description">"Three sampling campaigns were conducted in the Ballarat, Creswick and Maldon areas.

The premises for this study are that females now outnumber males as medical graduates and general practice trainees, yet women are significantly less likely than men to occupy rural and remote practice positions in Australia. Furthermore, the organisation of medicine remains strongly patriarchal. A feminist qualitative design underpins this empirical study involving: in-depth interviews with seventeen women activists and thirteen rural women general practitioners; grounded theory analysis of transcribed interviews; and interpretation of findings through a feminist poststructural lens. Findings uncover the gendered organisational and practitioner environment through which change is negotiated. At the organisational level, male exclusionary practices &#8211; played out through the &#8216;male as norm&#8217; and the &#8216;problem is women&#8217; discourses &#8211; position women in highly contradictory ways and marginalise their voices. Yet simultaneously, activists are challenging entrenched interests through individual and collective strategies of change which include: initiating gender-awareness projects; claiming legitimacy by using male-centred tactics and women-defined discourses; developing female-friendly initiatives; and mentoring of and building alliances between women. At the practitioner level, results reveal how women&#8217;s everyday lives as rural general practitioners are shaped by oppositional tensions. However, beyond the struggle of &#8216;fitting in&#8217;, women are altering rural medicine by (re)shaping meanings and (re)constructing work practices. Furthermore, their narratives suggest that rural spaces are integral to ways women carve out women-defined practice. A key innovation of this thesis is analysis of change at dual levels, both organisational and practitioner. This thesis marks a significant advancement upon the usual themes that attend only to the marginalisation of women and rural areas. It highlights the transformative process through which women (re)create the discursive spaces of rural general practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physicians</field><field name="subject">Rural health services</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magic and antimagic labeling of graphs</field><field name="creator">Sugeng, Kiki Ariyanti</field><field name="description">"A bijection mapping that assigns natural numbers to vertices and/or edges of a graph is called a labeling.

The growing use of illicit drugs throughout the Grampians region and the lack of resources and professional services available to regional and rural areas raise many questions as to treatment options and the accessibility and appropriateness of drug and alcohol and mental health services. Despite the fact that mental health professionals in rural/regional areas are expected to deliver the most appropriate care to individuals with a comorbid drug and alcohol and psychiatric disorder, a number of these rural/regional mental health professionals have limited preparation and experience in dealing with dual diagnosis issues. This phenomenological study focuses on the area of dual diagnosis, specifically the experiences of health professionals who care for clients diagnosed with a serious mental illness and a coexisting drug and alcohol disorder. Results are described in the form of four themes, which emerged from data collected during in-depth interviews with 13 mental health professionals who care for clients with a dual diagnosis. The themes captured in this research will be described using metaphors as headings. The first theme Sink or swim represents mental health professionals&#8217; initial preparation to care for this group of complex clientele. Treading water symbolises mental health professionals&#8217; endeavours to keep their head above water and reflects on their feelings while endeavouring to do so. Rowing against the tide describes mental health professionals&#8217; understanding of clients&#8217; drug misuse, which impacts greatly on the level of care.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychiatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Drugs</field><field name="subject">Dual diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A locale of the cosmos : an epic of the Wimmera : exegesis and text</field><field name="creator">Rieth, Homer Manfred</field><field name="description">"This project has, for its central component, an epic poem, 'A locale of the cosmos'. The accompanying exegesis examines epic as an ancient, but continually evolving form. It argues that, as a contemporary example of the genre and, as a sustained poetic rumination on landscape and memory, 'A locale of the cosmos' represents a significant development within the modern tradition of autobiographical epic. In broader terms, 'A locale of the cosmos' privileges the landscape and history of a region of Australia, the Wimmera region of north-western Victoria and, in doing so, explores the cumulative effects of the physical environment as a site for sustained poetic treatment. The poem is, therefore, an epic of both historical narrative and philosophical reflection, giving meaning to and interpreting ideas of space, place and locale. "Furthermore, it explores, in particular, the psychological and spiritual effects of vast horizontal distances, created by a landscape in which endless plains and immense horizons form an analogue of the wider cosmos. The poem's themes, therefore, bear not only on the prominences of the visible locale, but also explore the salients of an interior world, a landscape of the mind to which the poetry gives shape and meaning."</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epic poetry</field><field name="subject">Wimmera</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacovigilance Decision Support: The value of Disproportionality Analysis Signal Detection Methods, the development and testing of Covariability Techniques, and the importance of Ontology</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Gary</field><field name="description">The cost of adverse drug reactions to society in the form of deaths, chronic illness, foetal malformation, and many other effects is quite significant. For example, in the United States of America, adverse reactions to prescribed drugs is around the fourth leading cause of death. The reporting of adverse drug reactions is spontaneous and voluntary in Australia. Many methods that have been used for the analysis of adverse drug reaction data, mostly using a statistical approach as a basis for clinical analysis in drug safety surveillance decision support. This thesis examines new approaches that may be used in the analysis of drug safety data. These methods differ significantly from the statistical methods in that they utilize co variability methods of association to define drug-reaction relationships. Co variability algorithms were developed in collaboration with Musa Mammadov to discover drugs associated with adverse reactions and possible drug-drug interactions. This method uses the system organ class (SOC) classification in the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC) data to stratify reactions. The text categorization algorithm BoosTexter was found to work with the same drug safety data and its performance and modus operandi was compared to our algorithms. These alternative methods were compared to a standard disproportionality analysis methods for signal detection in drug safety data including the Bayesean mulit-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), which was found to have a problem with similar reaction terms in a report and innocent by-stander drugs. A classification of drug terms was made using the anatomical-therapeutic-chemical classification (ATC) codes. This reduced the number of drug variables from 5081 drug terms to 14 main drug classes. The ATC classification is structured into a hierarchy of five levels. Exploitation of the ATC hierarchy allows the drug safety data to be stratified in such a way as to make them accessible to powerful existing tools. A data mining method that uses association rules, which groups them on the basis of content, was used as a basis for applying the ATC and SOC ontologies to ADRAC data. This allows different views of these associations (even very rare ones). A signal detection method was developed using these association rules, which also incorporates critical reaction terms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Drug reactions</field><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Signal detection methods</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical ethnographic study of older people participating in their health care in acute hospital environments</field><field name="creator">Penney, Wendy</field><field name="description">"While consumer participation is the focus of 21st century health policy, little is known about this concept from the perspectives of people who require acute hospital services.

As a non&#8211;Indigenous Australian migrant, my knowledge of Indigenous Australian spiritual and cultural matters was limited, as was knowledge of Indigenous Australian history, both pre- and post-European settlement. As a migrant, I have many memories and experiences of spring water at European wells, springs and places of pilgrimage where healing, both physical and spiritual was sought. In childhood, I enjoyed reading the many myths and legends that surround the magical, mysterious and often invisible resource of spring water. Realising that my current knowledge of spring water relied more on folklore and anecdotal information than on fact, I decided that the topic of spring water offered worthwhile opportunities for research. [...] The availability of spring water is being challenged on more than one front. This research explores and investigates the abundance of (particularly) art references to spring water in Indigenous Australian culture and traditions, while noting the dearth of art references relating specifically to spring water in non-Indigenous Australian culture; although an abundance of art references to water in general is revealed. In the latter context, references to art depicting aspects of the hydrologic cycle have been substituted and explored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outcomes and implications of a koala translocation in the Ballarat region</field><field name="creator">Santamaria, Flavia</field><field name="description">This research examined the outcome of a translocation of 30 koalas moved from French Island to three sites on mainland Victoria (Creswick, Enfield and Lal Lal State Forests)</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Habitat</field><field name="subject">Koalas</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/15201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">If I Belong Here...How Did That Come To Be?</field><field name="creator">Lambeth, Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to contribute a non indigenous perspective to current discourse on sense of place in contemporary Australia.

In 1919, as a unique and distinct people they appeared to be in a position to maintain their identity, to resist absorption into western culture and to avoid some of the serious social problems that came to affect some other Indigenous communities. While aspects of the Tiwi culture and lifestyle were gradually modified or abandoned through contact with outside societies between 1919 and 2000, other traits remained strong or were strengthened. These included their relationship with the land, the local language, dancing and singing, and adoption customs. Forms of visual art, some introduced, brought fame to the Tiwi. Government policies on Indigenous matters changed dramatically over the twentieth century. The earlier ones, including assimilation programmes were discriminatory and restrictive. Later approaches to Aboriginal and Islander welfare, including land rights, had significant consequences for the Islanders, some beneficial, others detrimental in nature. From the 1970s, the departure of resident missionaries and government officers from the islands led to an influx of private European employees. The exposure to these people added to that which the Tiwi experienced as they travelled far beyond their islands. After 1972, the policies of self-determination and, then, self-management placed enormous strains on the Tiwi as they strove to meet the requirements of government, private enterprise and the wider society. New forms of land and local government controls replaced the law of the elders. A younger, western-educated generation now spoke on behalf of the people. Ultimately, under the influence of outside pressures, degrees of socio-cultural absorption occurred in the islands even though the official policy of assimilation had been abandoned. Fortunately, the strong identity of the Tiwi ensured a level of social cohesion capable of combating full assimilation into a wholly western lifestyle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Tiwi</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DSM-IV AD/HD symptoms: Prevalence, gender and age differences, and construct validity of parent and teacher ratings of Malaysian children</field><field name="creator">Hafetz, Nina</field><field name="description">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) is marked by deficits in attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The current DSM-IV conceptualisation of AD/HD as comprising of separate, but related, Inattention (IA) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (H/I) dimensions have been supported in confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies. Despite being one of the most extensively studied childhood disorder, there is a lack of research on AD/HD in non-western populations. Research on AD/HD in Asian countries, particularly, is limited. To date, no study has comprehensively investigated the characteristics of AD/HD in a Malaysian sample. The current study had 4 major aims. The first aim of the study was to investigate how the IA and H/I symptoms groups vary by age, gender, and age by gender interaction. The second aim of the study was to obtain prevalence rates of DSM-IV AD/HD and the three subtypes (i.e., Predominantly Inattentive Type, AD/HD-IA; Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Type, AD/HD-H/I; and Combined Type, AD/HD-C) within this population. This was examined for boys and girls separately, and together. The third aim of the study was to investigate the internal validity of DSM-IV AD/HD using single source confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while the fourth aim of the study was to examine trait, source and error variance of the AD/HD symptoms using the CFA multitrait (IA and H/I) by multisource (parent and teacher) approach (CFA MT-MS). All the CFA and CFA MT-MS analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls and used scores recoded via the binary method, as opposed to the ordinal scoring method. The sample consisted of 934 Malaysian schoolchildren aged 6-12 years (436 boys: mean age 8.86 years; and 498 girls: mean age 9.02 years) [...] There was more source than trait variance for parent rated H/I and teacher rated IA for girls. Unique to the current study is the use of binary as opposed to ordinal data to run the CFA and MTMS analysis. The implications of the findings for the conceptualisation, assessment, treatment, psychometric properties of AD/HD rating scales and the recognition of AD/HD in the Malaysian population are discussed. Suggestions for future research are offered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization based methods for solving some problems in telecommunications and the internet</field><field name="creator">Jia, Long</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to develop some new algorithms based on optimization techniques for solving some problems in some areas of telecommunications and the Internet. There are two main parts to this thesis. In the first part we discuss optimization based stochastic and queueing models in telecommunications network corrective maintenance. In the second part we develop optimization based clustering (OBC) algorithms for network evolution and multicast routing. The most typical scenario encountered during mathematical optimization modelling in telecommunications, for example, is to minimize the cost of establishment and maintenance of the networks subject to the performance constraints of the networks and the reliability constraints of the networks as well. Most of these optimization problems are global optimization, that is, they have many local minima and most of these local minima do not provide any useful information for solving these problems. Therefore, the development of effective methods for solving such global optimization problems is important. To run the telecommunications networks with cost-effective network maintenance,we need to establish a practical maintenance model and optimize it. In the first part of the thesis, we solve a known stochastic programming maintenance optimization model with a direct method and then develop some new models. After that we introduce queue programming models in telecommunications network maintenance optimization. The ideas of profit, loss, and penalty will help telecommunications companies have a good view of their maintenance policies and help them improve their service. In the second part of this thesis we propose the use of optimization based clustering (OBC) algorithms to determine level-constrained hierarchical trees for network evolution and multicast routing. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem with a non-smooth, non-convex objective function. Different algorithms are examined for solving this problem. Results of numerical experiments using some artifiicial and real-world databases are reported.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cluster analysis</field><field name="subject">Multicasting</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Network performance</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="subject">Stochastic analysis</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The due process of accounting standard setting in Australia : the case of AAS27 : financial reporting by local governments</field><field name="creator">Hurst, Gavin</field><field name="description">"This study enquires into the accounting standard system in Australia and questions the appropriateness of its core democratic participatory vehicle, the due process.

Such was the popularity of Mechanics&#8217; Institutes, and so reflective of contemporary British cultural philosophy, that they were copied throughout the British Empire. The Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute, established in 1859, instilled a powerful, male-gendered British middle-class influence over the cultural, social and educational development of the Ballarat city. The focus of this study is to identify and analyse the significance of the contribution made by the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute to the evolving cultural development of the wider Ballarat community, with a particular emphasis on the gender and class dimensions of this influence. This is done within the context of debates about &#8216;radical fragments&#8217; and &#8216;egalitarianism&#8217;. Utilizing a methodology based on an extensive review of archival records, contemporary newspapers held at the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute, and previously published research, this study was able to show that, during the period from its inception in 1859 to 1880, the Institute became a focal point for numerous cultural, social and educational activities. As one of the few institutions open to all classes, it was in a position to provide a significant influence over the developing culture of the Ballarat community. The study has also identified the use made of the Institute&#8217;s School of Design by women and the contribution of these educational classes to preparing women for employment outside their traditional roles of wives and mothers. The thesis argues that despite some early radical elements, the Ballaarat Mechanics&#8217; Institute initially espoused liberal egalitarian values. By 1880, however, the Institute was more readily identifiable as reflecting British, male, middle-class values.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ballaarat</field><field name="subject">Ballarat</field><field name="subject">Mechanics' Institute</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comprehensive profile of elite tennis and strategies to enhance match play performance</field><field name="creator">Hornery, Daniel</field><field name="description">"This dissertation illustrates an interdisciplinary sport science approach to further understand the interaction between physiology and performance in tennis.

Restoration ecology re-establishes these valued processes. State-and-transition models summarise knowledge of vegetation dynamics and tools for restoration, and encourage the incorporation of new information. The model developed here for semi-arid woodlands of north-west Victoria highlighted the unknown cause of observed, natural recruitment and the need for a technique, other than direct seeding and handplanting, for enhancing the recruitment of desirable species. I pursued these knowledge gaps for two dominant, woodland trees: Allocasuarina luehmannii and Casuarina pauper. Natural recruitment of juvenile C. pauper was found to be limited and primarily from root suckers. Extensive recruitment of A. luehmannii was shown to be mostly seedlings established following substantial reductions in grazing pressure since 1996. Seedlings were associated with areas devoid of ground flora near a female tree. The importance of competition between seedlings and ground flora, spatial variation in soil moisture and individual variation in the quantity of seed produced deserves further investigation to enhance future restoration success. Root suckers of both C. pauper and A. luehmannii can be artificially initiated, albeit in low numbers and this was found to be a feasible, new tool for restoration. Suckers are preceded by the growth of callus tissue on exposed or damaged, living, shallow roots. Both male and female trees can produce suckers and spring treatments may be more successful. Genetic fingerprinting of mature A. luehmannii and C. pauper trees in six populations did not identify any clonal individuals indicating that recruitment in the past has been from seedlings. Despite this, the high level of gene flow suggests that the impact of introducing small numbers of root suckers into existing populations is unlikely to impact negatively on the population genetics of these species.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Restoration</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ballarat and its benevolent asylum : A nineteenth-century model of Christian duty, civic progress and social reform</field><field name="creator">Kinloch, Helen</field><field name="description">"This study of Ballarat and its Asylum covers the period between the 1850s and the early 1900s when an old-age pension was introduced in Victoria.

The introduction of a secular education system in Victoria, together with enthusiasm among producers for technological innovation and skill development, led to changes in the nature and conditions of paid work, as well as to a push among workers and their sympathizers for greater appreciation of past contributions by older workers and the needs of the ill and/or incapacitated.

Studies have explored the meaning of spirituality held by patients and nurses, the spiritual needs of patients, and methods of providing spiritual care in nursing. However, few studies have investigated nurses&#8217; own spiritual health and the significance this may have on the provision of holistic nursing care. The aim of this study, therefore, was to inform nursing regarding the spiritual health of nurses and the influence that nurses&#8217; own spiritual health has on their ability to provide holistic nursing care to their patients. The study was conducted in two phases using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Phase one consisted of a survey of Division 1 nurses currently employed in the Grampians region of Victoria to describe key dimensions of their spiritual health. This survey provided biographical data and, through the use of the &#8220;Shalom Measure of Spiritual Health&#8221;, discovered the ideal of spiritual health held by nurses as well as the nurses&#8217; perception of patient needs pertaining to the achievement of spiritual health. Phase two utilised Naturalistic Inquiry to further explore the meaning of spirituality and spiritual health held by nurses, and the methods of achieving these for nurses and patients. The findings revealed that although nurses perceive the spiritual dimension of patient care to be important, they feel ill-equipped to provide this aspect of care. In addition, the major support for nurses, who themselves experience spiritual distress whilst at work, comes from colleagues. Further, prevailing health care systems in place do not always lend themselves to holistic approaches to care. This study identifies the need for nurse education to redress the clearly inadequate preparation nurses are given for this aspect of their role. Health care policy-makers and administrators also have a responsibility to consider all dimensions of care when designing and implementing health care guidelines and systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holistic nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Spiritual health</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflective space: A personal journey towards a re-envisioning of the Australian landscape</field><field name="creator">Donald, Colin</field><field name="description">Whilst the notion of the &#8216;Reflective Space&#8217; could arguably encompass many conceptual positions and propositions, for the purposes of this research investigation the &#8216;Reflective Space&#8217; referred to in the title of this exegesis will focus upon what I consider as an emerging and growing consciousness of the natural world. As a theoretical and conceptual construct, the investigation considers how this growing consciousness can be seen to be expressed through the medium of representations of the Australian landscape. This work considers a number of contemporary theoretical positions and a number of relevant social and political questions; it also acknowledges that within such spheres of reflection, the issue of being sustainable in relation to our interactions and perceptions of this natural world looms as perhaps one of the most pressing of our time. While it will be acknowledged that the depiction of landscape enjoys a long-standing tradition within the Australian cultural mind, the suggestion will be made that certain aspects of these visualisations can be seen to be &#8216;reflective&#8217; of a visual, cultural and physical degradation, and indeed even an apprehension of the physical &#8216;space&#8217; that is represented as landscape. The investigation considers and reflects upon what can be observed as contentious and ambivalent attitudes expressed towards landscape perceived through works of art. Strategies for adopting a perceptual visual ethic grounded within the concepts and principles of sustainability will be presented for consideration. By applying such modes of interpretation to perceptions of land and landscape depiction, new appreciations for the cultural &#8216;space&#8217; that is landscape will be developed. Such understandings will consider and reflect upon the temporal nature of our natural world. The thesis is this: that to be able to think and act in a sustainable fashion in relation to our environment, our perceptions and interpretations of visualisations of landscape must include a recognition that the land is a &#8216;temporal&#8217; space, in which past and possible futures are immanent in the present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causes and prevention of airline baggage handler back injuries : safe designs required where behaviour and administrative solutions have had limited effect</field><field name="creator">Dell, Geoff</field><field name="description">"Back injuries have consistently been the most common types of injuries suffered by people at work.

Seven of the eight Victorian Synemon species are considered as threatened. This study has determined through extensive fieldwork that most of these species are now restricted to very small remnants of their particular habitats. These findings have been integrated into a review of the current distribution, biology and habitat requirements of all the Victorian species. This has enabled recommendations for their long-term conservation and management to be made. Special attention was paid to the Pale Sun-moth (Synemon selene Klug, 1850) because it appeared to be nationally endangered and without a government strategy for its conservation. Also, there was strong circumstantial evidence of complete parthenogenesis within all of its Victorian populations. The Victorian occurrences are shown to be parthenogenetic, although specimens of both sexes are known from a ?now-extinct population near Two Wells, South Australia. It was also established that these parthenogenetic populations include five distinct morphs, two or three of which occur sympatrically at four localities in the Wimmera area. Parthenogenetic populations of these morphs cannot interbreed, this potentially restricting their genetic diversity. The extent of genetic diversity was examined with all parthenogenetic Victorian morphs of S. selene. DNA sequencing of 1515 bp of the COI gene revealed a maximum divergence level of 12 bp between some of the morphs and 1 to 2 bp within some morphs. This level of genetic diversity implies that these morphs have continued to evolve in the absence of males through time. This study has highlighted the special academic interest of S. selene and the urgent need for its adequate conservation. Some important directions for future research on the species are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Window on an era : Geelong : a post-industrial city</field><field name="creator">McNeice, Kelly</field><field name="description">"Non-economical industrial sites are being demolished in Geelong, making way for alternative economic development.

I have chosen three, Australian painters; Sidney Nolan, James Gleeson and Brett Whiteley. I have looked carefully at how the works of various poets have influenced and inspired these artists. I have put forward the idea that this engagement with the poetic realm has greatly enhanced the artist&#8217;s creative form-making. Indeed these artists have acknowledged their strong links with the world of poetry. I have touched very briefly on the ideas of some renowned philosophers who stress society&#8217;s need for fine works of art. In my opinion great works of art can come from this linking of painting with poetry and therefore, this nexus is to be encouraged. I have in my own painterly works looked to the poets for inspiration. In The Wimmera Series of landscape works, I read Brian Edwards&#8217; and Homer Reith&#8217;s poetry, and found in their imagery a rich source of creative ideas. I continued to read the works of the poets and found that the poetry of Ezra Pound, Dante Alighieri, Judith Wright and the works of many others, were an inspirational and catalytic force. I have also discovered on this artistic journey that the very writing of poetry, my own attempts in this field, seemed to bring to my painting, a sharper, a more analytical and critical focus. Renowned art critics and art historians have criticised contemporary art for its lack of the poetic, and its boring shallowness. I would urge artists to engage with the poetic realm, and this interplay between painting and poetry, may produce fine works of lasting greatness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-linear analogues of Lagrange functions in constrained optimization</field><field name="creator">Giri, Jason</field><field name="description">"This thesis investigates several non-linear analogues of Lagrange functions in the hope of answering the question 'Is it possible to generalise Lagrange functions such that they may be applied to a range of nonconvex objective problems?'

Basically, organisations depend on ICT technology for every part of their business. Companies are not only challenged to apply new technologies to remain competitive, they also need to spread (diffuse), manage and implement technological innovation across extended organisational boundaries. Diffusion, management and implementation of ICT innovation involve a considerable amount of risk and potentially protracted delays of technological projects. As a consequence of high demand for ICT innovation, as well as the risk of failure, a wide range of organisations such as state agencies and banks now employ so-called change agents to diffuse, manage and implement innovation within technological projects. While a large number of academics and practitioners are concerned with change agents who alter organisational culture, structure and processes, relatively little research has been undertaken on the role of ICT change agents in the innovation process. Thus, this professional doctorate study aims to fill that gap by exploring ICT change agents&#8217; project work experiences within state agencies and banks and fuse them with theory. The research is based on case study methodology, including 41 cases within 12 target organisations in Australia and Germany. As a former ICT change agent, the researcher of this Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) study applied mixed research methods, also incorporating her ICT project experiences by using an individual reflection model. From this investigation emerged that change agents&#8217; roles are embedded in components (organisational structure, project stages) and processes (ICT diffusion, informal networks). These findings underpin the model of ICT change agents who perform the multiple linker roles of these components and processes in order to deliver set project outcomes. The model is designed to inform practice by providing guidance for advanced ICT change agents&#8217; training in public and private sector settings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Underwater kicking following the freestyle tumble-turn</field><field name="creator">Clothier, Peter</field><field name="description">Swim turns are a component of competitive swimming where considerable advantage can be gained or lost. This thesis investigates underwater dolphin and flutter kicking techniques and their application to exits following the turn in freestyle swimming. Five separate investigations were conducted to examine the kinetics and kinematics of each underwater kicking technique and are presented in expanded journal manuscript form. Studies one, two and three involved the comparison of freestyle turns when using flutter and dolphin kicking wall exit techniques. The results obtained indicated that freestyle turns using flutter kicking were faster than dolphin kicking in age-group swimmers. For this group, significant and equal improvements were made to flutter and dolphin kick turn performances following six weeks of dolphin kick and dolphin kick turn training. However, no difference in turn times were observed between kicking conditions by older and more highly skilled swimmers. Study four involved a kinematical comparison of maximal underwater free-swimming dolphin and flutter kicking. Results showed dolphin kick to be a superior underwater free-swimming technique. Greater foot width, increased ankle range of movement and greater vertical displacement of the ankle and foot during kicking were shown to be highly predictive of faster underwater dolphin kicking. Investigation five compared the drag forces and kinematics between the dolphin and flutter kicking techniques while subjects were towed at velocities representing those experienced following wall turn push-off. Results favour the dolphin kick as a superior underwater technique at these higher velocities. Increased underwater dolphin kicking efficiency, as measured by decreased net towing force, was found to be associated with larger kick amplitude &#8211; rate ratios, and higher kick amplitude &#8211; streamline length ratios.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swimming</field><field name="subject">Starts and turns</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the wear resistance and durability of high speed steel for use in sheep shearing comb construction</field><field name="creator">Creelman, Glenn</field><field name="description">"The goal of this thesis was to evaluate high speed steel for use in the construction of sheep shearing combs, to determine if its use can be justified on a performance basis."</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural machinery</field><field name="subject">Machinery</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Littoral macroinverterbrates in relation to native and exotic riparian vegetation in streams of central Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jayawardana, Chandamali</field><field name="description">"Exotic willows (Salix spp.) are widespread riparian tree species of streams in temperate Australian and New Zealand.

A multi-level approach was implemented to promote the package. West Vic Division of General Practice conducted the General Practice Education Support and Community Linkages implementation program for the package in Western Victoria and focused on health assessments for those over 75 years. This research investigated what factors affected change in rural general practitioner practice through surveying general practitioners and collecting Health Insurance Commission data prior to and following the program. Patients were also interviewed to determine acceptance of health assessments and nurse involvement. The program increased awareness, but had little effect on increasing uptake, as only 53% of general practitioners began undertaking health assessments. However the general practitioners indicated an increased frequency of health assessment prescription. Health Insurance Commission data suggested an immediate increase in the use of the assessments, however the rate fluctuated and then declined. Lack of sustained uptake of the program was not associated with remuneration, as 77% of general practitioners did not regard finance as a barrier. Respondents&#8217; major barrier was time (40% pre-education, 73% post-education). This data reflected a rural environment where general practitioners face competing priorities, time constraints, workforce shortage and long consultation lists. A notable change did however occur from practice nurse employment as the involvement of a practice nurse generally resulted in patient satisfaction with the assessment. It was apparent that a complex multifaceted and longer-term view is needed to address factors which limit rural general practitioners&#8217; ability to change. This needs to be addressed at the Commonwealth level and not in isolation in order to produce an integrated framework to enhance and promote, rather than demand change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicare</field><field name="subject">Insurance</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of multiple perspectives and knowledge in adverse drug reaction decision-making : Volume 1</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Michelle</field><field name="description">Injury and illness associated with drugs are major problems in Australia and around the world, despite significant developments in the area of adverse drug reaction (ADR) decision support technology. The aims of this thesis are: to investigate the ADR decision domain; to determine factors that may assist in the prevention, detection and management of ADRs; and, to inform the pre-requirements analysis phase of the development of decision support systems. An approach has been taken that permits open and grounded study of the decision environment. This approach can then be used to frame and inform the design of an ADR decision support system. Fifteen case studies that comprise self selected consumers, the treating medical practitioner/s and expert perspectives of a single instance of an ADR (fifteen in-depth consumer interviews, eight in-depth medical practitioner interviews and 30 expert written questionnaires), have been collected and analysed using a grounded theory approach, a symbolic interactionist theoretical framework and a social constructionist epistemology. The analysis was performed from three perspectives: individual case study analysis (all interviews for an instance of an ADR); group analysis (consumer, medical practitioner and expert views) and analysis combining the individual case studies and groups of data. Concepts, themes and theory have emerged from these data in the following areas: &#8226; the contribution of the differences in understanding of the core concepts within this domain, to misunderstandings between decision-makers; &#8226; the consumer as a diagnostic decision-maker in the ADR decision domain; &#8226; differential diagnostic strategies used by the consumers and medical practitioners; &#8226; complexities in the ADR decision domain that make diagnosis difficult; &#8226; the role of ADR information in consumer and medical practitioner decision-making; &#8226; decision types used by consumers and medical practitioners in the ADR decision domain; &#8226; resources used by consumers, medical practitioners and experts to inform their ADR decisions; &#8226; decision-making with partial knowledge of the consumer case history, drug behaviour and diseases; &#8226; the impact of suspected ADRs on consumers and on future decision-making; &#8226; medical practitioner/consumer decision-making models; and, &#8226; reasons for low ADR reporting and the impact on the development of new ADR knowledge. The results above suggest the following: &#8226; The ADR decision domain is more complex than the current ADR decision support focus and that broadening this focus may assist in providing a more complete and useful decision support solution. &#8226; Improving the prevention, detection and management of ADRs requires more than providing prescribers with up to date ADR information. Other important factors are sharing of information, awareness of the role of the consumer, a collaborative approach between the consumers and medical practitioners, and generation of new ADR knowledge. &#8226; A grounded theory analysis of case study data using the theoretical perspectives of social constructionism and symbolic interactionism provided insight into this domain from the perspectives of multiple decision-makers. This may be an approach that can be used by systems analysts to inform the requirements analysis phases of decision support within other domains. The results of this qualitative work are preliminary. Future work is required to confirm and expand these results.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drugs</field><field name="subject">Side effects</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New ramp metering control algorithm for optimizing freeway travel times</field><field name="creator">Lierkamp, Darren</field><field name="description">"In many cities around the world traffic congestion has been increasing faster than can be dealt with by new road construction.

Although profoundly autobiographical, the metaphoric images I have produced are not only a means to touch others but are inclusive of a broader experience than simply my own. Throughout the following exegesis I draw on the disciplines of psychology, sociology, mythology and history, to explore the metaphoric presences of the deities Hestia and Hermes and their relationship to ideas of Home and Not - Home. Particular qualities associated with Home may, for the traveller, become symbolically embodied within the figure of The Woman Who Waits. This simple perception of The Woman Who Waits, and the process of waiting for the traveller to return was explored and expanded through autobiographic art practice combined with visual and theoretical research.

Quantitative data, which was gathered via a mail-out questionnaire (response = 54 per cent) that was issued to 1,040 occupationally diverse professionals who worked in fourteen towns throughout north-western Victoria, was analysed to determine whether commuting and non-commuting professionals differed significantly in their community involvement. To explain why certain relationships emerged from survey analysis, face-toface interviews were subsequently undertaken with 24 questionnaire respondents. The key finding of this study is that there is a significant relationship between commuting status and the retention of rural professionals. A significantly greater proportion of noncommuters than commuters remain working in the one location for longer than five years.

A device called an access point (AP) acts as a base station in WLAN for connecting a group of users to the network via radio signal. During the planning of such a network an important problem is to determine the optimal number of these devices and their placement/distribution so that coverage, capacity, and physical security are maximised at minimum cost. In this thesis we are using continuous optimisation techniques to optimise the number of APs and their distribution while cost of deployment is reduced and physical security of the network is enhanced. To find the number and placement of APs, we developed a multi-objective functions model based on path losses and power for free space environments. The two functions in the models are combined by using a balancing parameter. Since it is recognised that some of the objectives can be handled one at a time, in another approach, we followed a step-by-step procedure. We start with a novel optimisation model based on path losses for indoor environments including obstacles. Cost of deployment is saved by finding the minimum number of APs ensuring that the path loss at each test point/receiver is below the given maximum path loss. Next, the physical security of the network is enhanced by placing the APs far from places accessible to unauthorised users to reduce the risk of intrusion into the network. This is achieved in the framework of the model by introducing potential unauthorised users in unauthorised areas for whom coverage is minimised. Due to the presence of obstacles in indoor buildings, the path loss function is discontinuous. Therefore, the objective functions are very complicated and most of the existing optimisation algorithms cannot be applied to solve the problem. We use a global optimisation algorithm that is not used by other researchers to solve the same problem. To validate the accuracy of the optimisation model and performance of the numerical methods, we run tests on several indoor buildings and use wide range of WLAN parameters. The results demonstrate the quality of our model and algorithm. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, we developed a software to assist the network designers in planning wireless LANs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="subject">Network analysis</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'And for harmony most ardently we long' : musical life in Ballarat, 1851-1871</field><field name="creator">Doggett, Anne</field><field name="description">"The study examines two decades in the musical life of Ballarat, a regional city in south-eastern Australia.

Safety culture may be conceptualised as an interpretive device that mediates between organisational safety rhetoric and safety programs on the one hand, and local workplace cultures on the other. More recently, risk-awareness has emerged as a cultural approach to safety. Front line workers are encouraged to become risk-aware through programs designed to prompt them to undertake mental or informal risk assessments before commencing work. The problem is that risk-awareness programs have not been the subject of systematic research and the impact of these programs on the culture of safety and the resultant level of risk is unknown. Therefore, this ethnographic study of two sites within a large contract maintenance organisation in Australia explored what impact risk-awareness programs have upon the culture of safety and the resultant level of risk. The researcher spent two months in the field and data was collected through participant observation, semistructured interviews and through a review of organisational documents. This study found that managers focused upon collecting the paperwork associated with the program as proof that workers had a safer workplace, whereas workers preferred to rely upon their common sense rather than the paperwork to keep them safe. As a consequence, the riskawareness program resulted in a culture of paperwork and varying levels of risk reduction because the paperwork associated with the program created an illusion of safety for managers as much as common sense did for workers. The results of this study have implications for safety culture, risk-awareness programs and for organisational learning. They also have implications for organisations wishing to improve their safety culture by encouraging risk-awareness in front-line workers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial safety</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Risk perception</field><field name="subject">Safety management</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OH&amp;S in small business : influencing the decision makers : the application of a social marketing model to increase the uptake of OHS risk control</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Stephen</field><field name="description">Losses resulting from traumatic injuries and occupational disease are prevalent in the small business sector of Australian industry. Although the true size of the problem is unclear, it is estimated that the losses amount to more than $8 billion annually. The hazard control measures to counter these losses are largely known and are available to small businesses but they are not widely adopted. Regulators and other bodies have employed a range of intervention strategies to influence decision-makers in small businesses but most have focussed on the dissemination of printed materials or broadbased advertising campaigns with limited success......... The research concludes that the listening processes at the heart of social marketing add to the methods already used in the OHS discipline by forcing the marketer to listen to the subjective assessment of risk as perceived by targets as well as to question the evidence base that supports the legitimacy and efficacy of the proposed intervention. The TTM was found to be a useful means of categorising small business decision-maker behaviour and assessing the readiness for change of individuals and therefore the messages that are needed to unfreeze behaviour. The TTM also provides a tool for evaluation of the impact of an intervention.As a result of this research it is suggested that opinion leaders, who are employed within a social marketing model to diffuse information, multiply the effort of those wishing to increase the adoption of an innovation. Thus engagement of opinion leaders by an OHS authority for the communication of risk control messages may be more cost-effective than attempting to visit every workplace within an industry group. Thus, although social marketing is not in the general repertoire of OHS interventions, it appears to be extremely useful as a framework for interventions and, when used in concert with a stages of change model, provides natural lead indicators for evaluating the impact of OHS interventions. Application of social marketing to people who have the responsibility for the health and safety of others was unique.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupational health</field><field name="subject">Industrial safety</field><field name="subject">Industrial safety</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiculturalism : (re) intellectualising teaching</field><field name="creator">Edmonds, George</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosphy</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multicultural education</field><field name="subject">Minorities education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into the experiences of occupational stress of graduate nurses in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Lee, Irene</field><field name="description">"The major criticism by hospital trained clinical nurses is that university graduates are perceived as not being competent practioners as a result of limited time spent in clinical areas.

The initial fears that newspapers would be decimated by the introduction of this technology have been proven groundless, but despite a high web presence by newspapers world wide, profitable models of cyber papers are elusive. In an online environment traditional relationships between newspaper advertising and editorial may not stand. Despite the considerable body of published literature concerning the movement of print newspapers to an online environment, little was found concerning online content. A need to re-evaluate what content and functions are considered to be desirable by print readers, in an online environment was identified as the main objective of this research. Evaluation the of user attitudes to web based newspapers provides a foundation for future research into areas such as developing effective models for profitable online newspapers. To achieve this objective, the research tools used were a content analysis, an online newspaper user survey and newspaper management personal interviews. The study looked at Victorian regional daily newspapers that also had online versions. By focussing on the regional newspapers, meaningful comparisons could be made between content, staff attitudes and readership interests. The content analysis measured the quantum and nature of the content of the print and online versions of the regional dailies during a one week period. This provided a measure of the type and source of the articles included both in print and online. Newspaper editorial staff interviews contributed a personalised view of content priorities, which was then contrasted with a web based questionnaire which measured user requirements in relation to content and interactivity. It was found from the survey that content alone would not provide a sufficient basis to build a profitable online regional newspaper site. The findings were analysed in relation to the literature, newspaper site content and editorial staff interviews. Despite regularly accessing online newspaper sites, it was found that users are unwilling to pay for the experience. Users indicated a desire for a higher level of interactivity, in addition to the content, which is currently provided, by online regional newspapers. Evaluation of user attitudes to web based newspapers provides a foundation for future research into the development of effective for profitable online newspapers.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic newspapers</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian newspapers</field><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/14587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When urban policy meets regional practice : Evidence based practice from the perspective of multi-disciplinary teams working in rural and remote health service provision</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Angela</field><field name="description">"In the main, contemporary research on Evidence Based Practice (EBP) has taken place within metropolitan locations, and has offered urbocentric solutions and insights.

Network design affects the performance, cost, scalability, and availability of parallel computers. Therefore, discovering a good structure of the network is one of the basic issues. From modeling point of view, the structure of networks can be naturally stud- ied in terms of graph theory. Several common desirable features of networks, such as large number of processing elements, good throughput, short data com- munication delay, modularity, good fault tolerance and diameter vulnerability correspond to properties of the underlying graphs of networks, including large number of vertices, small diameter, high connectivity and overall balance (or regularity) of the graph or digraph. The first part of this thesis deals with the issue of interconnection networks ad- dressing system. From graph theory point of view, this issue is mainly related to a graph labeling. We investigate a special family of graph labeling, namely antimagic labeling of a class of disconnected graphs. We present new results in super (a; d)-edge antimagic total labeling for disjoint union of multiple copies of special families of graphs. The second part of this thesis deals with the issue of regularity of digraphs with the number of vertices close to the upper bound, called the Moore bound, which is unobtainable for most values of out-degree and diameter. Regularity of the underlying graph of a network is often considered to be essential since the flow of messages and exchange of data between processing elements will be on average faster if there is a similar number of interconnections coming in and going out of each processing element. This means that the in-degree and out-degree of each processing element must be the same or almost the same. Our new results show that digraphs of order two less than Moore bound are either diregular or almost diregular.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/13722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sexual beliefs, attitudes and script of men convicted of sexual offences against children: An empirical investigation</field><field name="creator">Owen, Karen</field><field name="description">Community concern about sexual offending places continued pressure on correctional services to refine treatment and reduce re-offending. While cognitive processes have been identified as a key element in the development and maintenance of sexual offending, more research on the precise nature of these processes is required. The current study, based on Ward and Siegert&#8217;s Pathways Model, involved 100 male offenders of various types: 25 intra &#8211; familial sex offenders against children, 25 extra-familial sex offenders against children, 25 sex offenders who chose adult victims, and 25 convicted of non-sexual offences. There was also a control group of 25 non-offenders. The quantitative data, derived from a series of questionnaires concerning childhood and sexual experiences, provided evidence that the two types of child sex offender differed from the other groups with respect to their expectations of sexual behaviour among children, their experience of sexual abuse and neglect as children themselves, and, paradoxically, their current high self-esteem. In addition, scripts relating to hypothetical consenting adult sexual relations and sexual contact with a child were collected from the 50 sex offenders against children. The script content suggested that, compared with intra - familial offenders, extra-familial offenders had notably unrealistic, na&#239;ve and romanticised scripts for adult relationships and more sophisticated scripts for offences against children. The latter suggested that scripts might serve as a mediating function in offending behaviour and that offenders acquired a degree of task domain expertise. Despite some inherent problems undertaking research with the sex-offender population, the findings confirmed that sex-offenders do not constitute a homogenous group and that the pathways model offers a unique perspective on how males become and develop their capacity as sex-offenders, how they sustain a positive view of themselves, and how they continue to commit offences. Finally, the model was considered in terms of its capacity to suggest ways to better target treatment efforts to specific groups of sexual offenders to further reduce their rate of recidivism</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Digital Thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://archimedes.ballarat.edu.au:8080/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/13044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mana W&#257;hine in Information Technology: Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu</field><field name="creator">Hamilton-Pearce, Janette</field><field name="description">This thesis argues for an Indigenous women&#8217;s cultural construction of information technology (IT).  In Aotearoa New Zealand, M&#257;ori women have established Mana W&#257;hine discourses, principles, theories and practices (Evans, 1994; Hutchings, 2002b, 2005; Irwin, 1990, 1992b; Jahnke, 1997b; Pihama, 2001; Smith, 1992; Te Awekotuku, 1991).  Mana W&#257;hine is the power, legitimacy, authority and spirituality of M&#257;ori women as determined by m&#257;tauranga w&#257;hine [M&#257;ori women&#8217;s knowledge and epistemology] (Jenkins &amp; Pihama, 2001).  Mana W&#257;hine is about theorising, analysing and conducting research for, by, and with, M&#257;ori women (Pihama, 2001). M&#257;ori women have always been IT professionals through Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu [The Cloak Weavers and the Cloak].  The overall intent of this research is to develop a Mana W&#257;hine in IT conceptual framework.  The research aim is to identify the key discourses, principles and theories of Mana W&#257;hine for an Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s cultural construction of IT? IT has the cultural constructs of the dominant society, which design and shape it (Dirksen, 2001; Stewart, 1993).  The herstories of twenty-four Indigenous M&#257;ori women in IT provide lived experiences of colonising, decolonising and indigenising of IT.  The colonial oppression within IT education and the workplace underpin the hegemonic &#8216;geek neo-colonial male&#8217; culture.  Indigenous M&#257;ori women&#8217;s culture is constructed as the &#8216;Other&#8217;.  The Indigenous peoples&#8217; literature disregards gender and white women in IT literature disregard ethnicity, race and colonisation.  The joint effects of being Indigenous M&#257;ori women are fraught with complexity.  For Indigenous women to participate in IT means assimilating into geek neo-colonial and male beliefs maintaining culture-neutral ideology, as a new form of cultural imperialism.  Through such power relations, cultural identity is left at the door when entering IT where M&#257;ori women define themselves as the only lonely, the only Indigenous M&#257;ori woman. The decolonising and indigenising of IT is where M&#257;ori women assert their cultural rights to participate as Mana W&#257;hine in IT &#8211; Ng&#257; Kaiwhatu K&#257;kahu Me Te K&#257;kahu.

As a graphic designer who has direct experience of exploitation through employment, I am interested in researching the subjective experience of underpaid workers in New Zealand. In doing this I have sought to creatively synthesize experiences into artworks that provide a deeper insight into the impact of underpaid work. Through this investigation I have attempted to contribute to a broader discussion of underpaid work than what is currently provided, through the analysis of statistical data. In undertaking this project I have also been concerned with investigating new potentials in serigraphy (a graphic medium traditionally associated with working-class politics). I have inquired into how it might be used to create a visual &#8216;voice&#8217; for contemporary workers&#8217; narratives. Accordingly, this project has employed audio recordings of three personal stories. The research has led to the production of a series of serigraphic prints that artistically interpret the journeys and experiences of the participants. These images sit in discourse with looped audio excerpts of their recorded interviews. In this approach, narratives of marginalisation that have often been muted through their presentation as written records, have been re-conceptualised as an artists' images, with which the recordings are in discussion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">Working below the minimum wage</field><field name="subject">Serigraphic printing</field><field name="subject">Graphic design</field><field name="subject">Workers&#8217; rights</field><field name="subject">Large format screen printed posters</field><field name="subject">Semiotics of the working class</field><field name="subject">Reflexivity as an indicator of the voice of the worker</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReDress - ReFashion as a solution for clothing (un) sustainability</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Kim</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this practice based project is to promote debate and alter perceptions of second-hand materials and ReFashion concepts.

The WL has been trading in Auckland City&#8217;s central business district for almost fifty years. The WL opens in the early evening and remains open until the early morning hours. At closing, the WL is towed to a storage area where it remains until this process is repeated. This daily pattern has occurred since the WL opened in 1948. Because of its longevity, the WL, and many of its stakeholders have experienced ongoing change as Auckland City has grown, and competition within fast food has increased. Thus, for many stakeholders, the WL is representative of their lives, a mirror of their reality and life experiences. Obviously, these realities and experiences are different for different stakeholders. In this thesis, I examine the contested &#8220;White Lady&#8221; (WL): the perceptions and the social meanings that its stakeholder groups attribute to it. This thesis illuminates differences and similarities within stakeholder viewpoints and in doing so defines that pie carts like the WL are a valid part of New Zealand&#8217;s culinary and social cultures Ultimately, this thesis provides a platform of knowledge from which stakeholders and others can come to understand and know the differing and similar views that other stakeholder groups hold. With this in mind, this research ranges in scope from the examination of city administration to the symbolism associated with the (WL) by some of its stakeholders. Therefore, this research is founded within socio-historic constructs: the history of fast food and, the similarities that this history holds to today&#8217;s WL operation. The contextualisation of hospitality within &#8220;three domains&#8221; (Lashley, 2004, p.13) aids in defining the WL as well as recognising the competitive growth of New Zealand&#8217;s fast food industry. This research suggests that fast food growth and subsequent competition have had negative impacts upon many small fast food outlets including the WL. viii The growth of fast food has facilitated a &#8220;slow food&#8221; (Jones, Shears, Hiller Comfort and Lowell, 2003, p. 298) movement. This movement coupled with the hierarchy of food typologies, adds a Saussurian overlay and sociological discourse to this work. This overlay clarifies for the reader Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) position that all food is reflective of class status. Within postmodernist constructs and the rise of the individual, (and the consequent opportunity to hear &#8216;voices from the margins&#8217;), movement within class and individuality within New Zealand&#8217;s wider culture has occurred. Social change therefore, has facilitated some of the issues within WL contestation. In highlighting Bourdieu&#8217;s (1984) concept, the &#8220;binary opposition&#8221; (Levi-Strauss, 1981, as cited in Adamenko, 2007, p.27) inherent within food hierarchies and, as often expressed within the media, is examined. This examination reveals that while the media inform, this information often contributes to the polarisation of opinion that facilitates the formation of contested viewpoints by WL stakeholders. It is against a backdrop of compliance need, the absence of an official street trading policy, the differing views of stakeholders, and the intensification of competition in fast food, coupled with a lacuna in the knowledge base of younger Auckland residents regarding the WL that this research finds its voice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fast food</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Contestation</field><field name="subject">Hospitality</field><field name="subject">Pie cart</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple arithmetic processing : fact retrieval mechanisms and the influence of individual difference, surface from, problem type and split on processing</field><field name="creator">n.jackson@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Current theorising in the area of cognitive arithmetic suggests that simple arithmetic knowledge is stored in memory and accessed in the same way as word knowledge i.e., it is stored in a network of associations, with simple facts retrieved automatically from memory. However, to date, the main methodologies that have been employed to investigate automaticity in simple arithmetic processing (e.g., production and verification) have produced a wide variety of difficulties in interpretation. In an attempt to address this, the present series of investigations utilised a numerical variant of the well established single word semantic priming paradigm that involved the presentation of problems as primes (e.g., 2 + 3) and solutions as targets (e.g., 5), as they would occur in a natural setting. Adult university students were exposed to both addition and multiplication problems in each of three main prime target relationship conditions, including congruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 5), incongruent (e.g., 2 + 3 and 13), and neutral conditions (X + Y and 5). When combined with a naming task and the use of short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), this procedure enabled a more valid and reliable investigation into automaticity and the cognitive mechanisms underlying simple arithmetic processing. 

The first investigation in the present series addressed the question of automaticity in arithmetic fact retrieval, whilst the remaining investigations examined the main factors thought to influence simple arithmetic processing i.e., skill level, surface form, problem type and split. All factors, except for problem type, were found to influence processing in the arithmetic priming paradigm. For example, the results of all five investigations were consistent in revealing significant facilitation in naming congruent targets for skilled participants, following exposure to Arabic digit primes at the short SOA. Accordingly, the facilitation was explained in terms of the operation of an automatic spreading activation mechanism. Additionally, significant inhibitory effects in incongruent target naming were identified in skilled performance in all of the studies in the present series of investigations. Throughout the course of these investigations, these effects were found to vary with operation, surface form and SOA, and in the final investigation, the level of inhibition was found to vary with the split between the correct solution and the incongruent target. Consequently, a number of explanations were put forward to account for these effects. In the first two investigations, it was suggested that the inhibitory effects resulted from the use of a response validity checking mechanism, whilst in the final investigation, the results were more consistent with the activation of magnitude representations in memory (this can be likened to Dehaene&#146;s, 1997, &#145;number sense&#146;). In contrast, the results of the third investigation led to the proposal that for number word primes, inhibition in processing results from the activation of phonological representations in memory, via a reading based mechanism.     

The present series of investigations demonstrated the utility of the numerical variant of the single word semantic priming paradigm for the investigation of simple arithmetic processing. Given its capacity to uncover the fundamental cognitive mechanisms at work in simple arithmetic operations, this methodology has many applications in future research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arithmetic</field><field name="subject">Fact Retrieval</field><field name="subject">Individual Differences</field><field name="subject">Surface Form</field><field name="subject">Problem Type</field><field name="subject">Split Effects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070717.114439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can spectators become co-authors in the process of a story narrative</field><field name="creator">Enning, Tang</field><field name="description">This project explores the areas of human perception and story narrative in moving images. Engaged by the research question, &#8220;Can spectators become co-authors in the process of a story narrative?&#8221;, the research focuses on exploring the co-existence and contradiction between the values of spectators and an author in a process of a narrative by developing a new potential narrative approach with multiple perspectives. I hypothesise that spectators could participate with the story narrative process as co-authors. My key method is to engage with spectators&#8217; participation within a narration (story) by displaying story fragments across multiple screens simultaneously. The potential of having a story spread across multiple screens might bring further interest to authors to re-think the notion of a spectator and tell a story with multiple perspectives in a narrative process with spectators. In order to develop this project, I will use different approaches, such as Grounded Theory (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998), Data Visualisation (Tufte, 1983), Action Research (Kemmis &amp; McTaggart, 1988) and Heuristics (Moustakas, 1990), which I will explain in further details in each chapter of my exegesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Story narrative</field><field name="subject">Moving image</field><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Animation</field><field name="subject">Spectator</field><field name="subject">Author</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Co-author</field><field name="subject">Multiple screens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-conceptualising television advertising typologies</field><field name="creator">Aitken, Robert Walter</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new typology of television advertising that re-orientates existing research into advertising effectiveness and more accurately reflects new directions in communication theory. The typology provides a consumer-centric approach to analysing television advertisements and a different conceptualisation of the advertising response process.

Conventional research into advertising effectiveness has examined almost every aspect of the advertising mix to identify what makes an advertisement effective. The research is based on a number of assumptions. For example, mass communication is seen as a linear process with the advertiser at one end of a communication continuum and the consumer at the other. The function of advertising, in this reception paradigm, is to inform and then to influence the consumer and measures of its success include accuracy of recall and recognition. This process of persuasion comprises a number of hierarchical steps that should lead to purchase or to a positive propensity to purchase. The power of persuasion is related to the level of involvement between the advertised product and the potential customer and with the appropriateness of the advertised message and its execution. For example, elements such as music, humour and the use of celebrities have been studied to assess their persuasive powers and to understand their communication effects.

This thesis takes a different approach to understanding how advertising works and makes a number of different assumptions. According to this thesis, before it is possible to study the effects of advertising, it is necessary to find out how people respond to it. This introduces the three key concepts that underpin this thesis. These are reader-response theory, personal construct theory and uses and gratifications theory.

Reader-response theory suggests that the meaning and significance of any form of communication is co-created at the point of engagement. The meaning of a television advertisement, for example, is located, not in the advertisement itself, as in conventional research, but in the interaction between the advertisement and the viewer. The meanings that result in this process of negotiation are as much a reflection of personal, social and cultural experience as they are a response to particular executional and message strategies. To understand how consumers make sense of these communication texts it is necessary to study them at the point of reception.

The second key concept, personal construct theory, proposes that the way individuals make sense of their experiences and understand the world is determined by the personal constructs that they hold. Identifying these constructs will enable researchers to understand the meanings that consumers attach to communication messages and to focus more fundamentally on the psychological basis of the response process than on its individual components. Studying advertising effectiveness in the context of personal construct theory places the consumer at the centre of the response process and focuses attention on how meaning is negotiated. This has a number of important implications for practioners both in relation to the construction of television advertisements and in understanding consumers&#65533; responses to them. For example, practioners need to recognise the importance of producing television advertisements that address their audience as readers of media texts rather than merely as consumers of media products.

This re-conceptualising of the audience is clearly articulated in uses and gratifications theory, the third key concept in this study. Uses and gratifications theory, suggests that it is as important to understand what consumers do with advertising as it is to study what advertising does to consumers. This is in contrast to the emphasis on persuasion strategies in conventional advertising research.

Reader-response theory, personal construct theory and uses and gratifications theory suggest a more dynamic relationship between an advertisement and a consumer than is recognised by conventional research. These theories are encapsulated in a new typology of television advertising presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television advertising</field><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">consumption</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.181805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schools for the people? : church, state, and educational control in Scotland to 1872</field><field name="creator">Davidson, Julie Elaine</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the changing face of educational provision in nineteenth-century Scotland. In particular, it examines the reasons behind the Church of Scotland&#65533;s loss of official authority over schooling in 1872. From the time of the Reformation, the Church had been empowered to supervise all education in Scotland, to play the major role in the appointment of teachers, and to ensure that landowners assumed their responsibilities in the placing of a school in every parish. However, this authority had never operated straightforwardly, and in 1803 an Education Act transferred significant aspects of the Church&#65533;s power over the appointment of teachers in parochial schools - and therefore over the curriculum of those schools - to local landowners. In the course of the nineteenth century, the Church&#65533;s position was eroded still more substantially, until the Education Act of 1872 formally gave control over State sponsored establishments to locally-elected School Boards. The Church&#65533;s loss of power was directly connected with the formation of a system of universal, compulsory schooling for Scotland&#65533;s children.
	The study is structured in seven chapters. Chapter 1 considers the background to the educational developments of the nineteenth century: the profound social and ecclesiastical consequences of demographic change, industrialisation, and urbanisation. Section A (Chapters 2-4) explores the history of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s work in education, and the emergence of other churches which actively developed additional and rival schools in the 1800s. Chapter 2 examines the origins and working of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s system of parochial schools, and the responses of this system to a changing educational environment. Chapters 3-4 assess the place of the Church of Scotland&#65533;s ancillary institutions, Sessional and Assembly schools, and the activities of the Scottish Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK). Detailed consideration is given to the educational efforts of four other major denominations - the Free Church of Scotland, the United Presbyterian Church, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church - and to the schools established by the Society of Friends. The demonstrable inability of the Church of Scotland to meet its statutory obligations in both rural and urban areas, and the sheer scale of the educational provision made by other bodies, fostered a growing perception that responsibility for schooling could not be entrusted to any single voluntary institution, but required to be vested in the State.
	Section B (Chapters 5-7) examines the evolving ideals of rescue and reformation of the &#65533;perishing classes&#65533; in the work of Sunday, ragged, industrial, and reformatory schools, and the parts played by such schools in educating the poorest members of British society in the nineteenth century. As these parts can all be seen to be interconnected, it emerges that the Church of Scotland&#65533;s withdrawal from Sunday-school provision in 1799 compromised its capacity to meet the needs of a growing constituency of vulnerable children, and exacerbated its inability to provide appropriate instruction for those most affected by the turmoil of industrialisation. The lay composition of the committees that managed all of these schools also contributed to the marginalisation of the institutional voice of the Church in administering Scotland&#65533;s education.
	In the end, the Church of Scotland lost control to the State in 1872 because it was unable to adapt its parochial structure sufficiently to provide appropriate schooling to meet the challenges of a changed world.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">Scotland</field><field name="subject">education and state</field><field name="subject">church and education</field><field name="subject">church history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.182314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental anxiety in New Zealand, 1850-1920 : settlers, climate, conservation, health, environment</field><field name="creator">Beattie, James John</field><field name="description">Using a series of interlocking case-studies, this thesis investigates environmental anxieties in New Zealand&#65533;s settler society in the period 1830-1920. A central premise of this study is that the rapid environmental transformation of New Zealand stimulated widespread anxieties and reforms within settler society. These anxieties focussed as much on the changes already begun as on apprehensions of the results of these changes. Applying the concept of environmental anxiety to settler New Zealand expands understandings about colonial culture and its environmental history. It moves debate beyond simple narratives of colonial environmental destruction. Instead, this thesis highlights the ambiguities and complexities of colonial views of the natural world. This thesis points to the insecurities behind seeming Victorian confidence, even arrogance, in the ability of science and technology to bring constant material improvement. Europeans recognised that modern living brought material advantages but that the rapid environmental changes that underpinned these improvements also brought and threatened to bring unwanted outcomes.
	A diverse range of settlers worried about the effects of environmental changes. Individuals, institutions, committees, councils, doctors, scientists, artists, governments, engineers and politicians expressed environmental anxieties of one kind or another. Some farmers, politicians and scientists held that deforestation decreased rainfall but increased temperatures. Other scientists and politicians feared that it brought devastating floods and soil erosion. Some Maori, travellers, politicians and scientists held that it destabilised sand that would inundate fertile fields. Councillors, engineers and doctors constantly debated ways of improving the healthiness of towns and cities, areas seen as particularly dangerous places in which to live. Doctors&#65533; and settlers&#65533; anxieties focused on the effects of New Zealand&#65533;s climate on health and racial development. The impact of environmental change on the healthiness of certain areas, as well as the role played by humans in climate change, also provoked lively discussion.
	The effects of these anxieties are evident in some of the land policies, artworks, legislation, parliamentary and scientific debates, and writings of this period. Settlers believed curbing pollution, laying out parks, planting trees and restricting the construction of unhealthy properties improved living conditions in cities. Some scientists and politicians thought setting aside forest &#65533;climate reserves&#65533; in highland areas, tree-planting legislation and sustainable forestry practices prevented flooding and climate change. Individuals and authorities also established sanatoria and spas in particularly healthy spots, such as at the seaside and in high, dry places.
	In investigating these topics, this thesis expands the discipline of environmental history, bringing to light the importance of studying urban environments, aesthetics, climate change, desertification and health. It expands the largely &#65533;national&#65533; narratives of New Zealand&#65533;s environmental histories by acknowledging that local environments, events and attitudes as well as global environments, events and attitudes shaped anxieties and policies. Global ideas, often operating at a local level, played a role in reinforcing and providing solutions to New Zealand&#65533;s environmental anxieties. This thesis also acknowledges the on-going significance of Christianity in under-girding ideas about improvement and environmental protection. Most significantly, perhaps, this study underlines both that many settlers displayed an emotional attachment to the New Zealand environment and that most colonists wanted to ensure the long-term productivity of its lands.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand history</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20051020.183413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogical possibilities for nursing</field><field name="creator">Neehoff, Shona Maree</field><field name="description">Nursing practice is a very physical business. The work that most nurses do involves the use of their bodies as the primary tool of their work. Nurses take their physical selves to patients in order to carry out that work, the body of the nurse is often in direct contact with the bodies of patients that they care for. This thesis is about what I have called the &#65533;invisible bodies of nursing&#65533;, and I describe these throughout the body of the thesis. The physical body of the nurse, the body of practice, and the body of knowledge.
	The physical body of the nurse is absent in most nursing literature, it is sometimes inferred but seldom discussed. My contention is that the physical body of the nurse is invisible because it is tacit. Much nursing practice is invisible because it is perceived by many nurses to be inarticulable and is carried out within a private discourse of nursing, silently and secretly. Nursing knowledge is invisible because it is not seen as being valid or authoritative or sanctioned as a legitimate discourse by the dominant discourse.
	I approach these issues through an evolving &#65533;specular&#65533; lens. Luce Irigaray&#65533;s philosophy of the feminine and her deconstructing and reconstructing of psychoanalytic structures for women inform my work. Michel Foucault&#65533;s genealogical approach to analysing discourses is a powerful tool for exploring the history of the creation of the nurse and offers critical insights in to how nursing is perceived today. Maurice Merleau-Ponty&#65533;s phenomenology provides the flesh for my discussions about the embodied practice of nurses as beings in the world.
	Nursing&#65533;s struggle for recognition is ongoing. I discuss strategies that nurses could use to make themselves more &#65533;visible&#65533; in healthcare structures. The exploration of the embodied self of the nurse and through this the embodied knowledge of nursing is nascent. I hope to provide for nurses some food for both thought and discussion.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">professional recognition</field><field name="subject">feminist theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.183802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomy of microvenous valves of normal and venous ulcerated lower limbs</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Mark N.</field><field name="description">Venous disease is a very common disease that affects millions of people worldwide. While some of the factors that cause the development of varicose veins are well understood, the aetiology of venous ulceration is poorly understood. It has been demonstrated that venous valve failure in the large veins is an important factor leading to the development of varicose veins, however whether similar valves exist in the very small superficial veins of the human leg, and what role these valves may have in venous disease, is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to: 1. Identify whether venous valves are present in the very small superficial veins of the human leg, and if they are present, 2. Describe the density, size distribution, morphology, and regional distribution of these microvenous valves in &#65533;normal&#65533; cadaveric legs 3. Compare the &#65533;normal&#65533; microvenous valves from cadaveric tissue with microvenous valves from pathologic legs with chronic venous disease, to answer the hypothesis that individuals that develop venous ulceration have fewer microvenous valves than the normal population. In order to examine microvenous valves, two main methods have been utilised, E12 sheet plastination and vascular casting. These methods in combination provide valuable insights into the anatomy of microvenous channels, and allow examination and quantification of the venous valves. Using several techniques, this study has shown that microvenous valves are present within the very small veins of the superficial tissue of the human leg. These microvalves have been shown to be most prevalent in the smallest of the veins, down to 18[mu]m in diameter. Approximately 60% of the valves were found to be associated with tributaries. The gaiter region was demonstrated to contain the lowest number and density of microvenous valves, significantly less that the upper or mid calf regions. In addition, the gaiter region was found to have a much lower proportion of microvalves in the most superficial veins, when compared with the other regions examined. Contrary to our hypothesis, the number and density of microvalves in venous diseased legs was not different to that of normal legs. Similarly, the size and regional distributions were also not different. However, the microvalves from the venous diseased legs were significantly stretched and incompetent, allowing retrograde flow from the large veins through to the dermal capillaries. In conclusion, this study has shown that venous valves are present in the smallest of the superficial veins of the human leg, and that their density and distribution is not different between normal and venous diseased individuals. However, the microvalves from the diseased legs were incompetent and allowed retrograde flow. The role that these valves play in normal and pathological circulation is unclear, and warrants further examination.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">veins</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">venuous valves</field><field name="subject">ulcers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060523.142055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pyridylacetylenes and their cobalt clusters; novel naphthalimide monomers and polymers</field><field name="creator">Dana, Bogden Hariton</field><field name="description">A series of 2,6- and 3,5-ethynylpyridyl compounds and their cobalt clusters have been prepared and analysed in Chapter 2, in order to study through-space and through-bond interactions between the ethynyl arms. Bidentate N- donor ligands, such as bipyridine and o-phenanthroline with alkyne functionality have been used extensively as building blocks for a wide range of molecular materials, but monodentate ethynylpyridyls have received less attention.
	The results showed that while there is no orbital restriction on a RC[triple bond]C-n-[pi]&#65533;cc-C[triple bond]CR through-bond interaction in 2,6-ethynylpyridyls, no significant interaction exists. Nevertheless, there are intramolecular interactions as manifested in the distortions which occur in the solid state structure of the compounds and the lability of the diphenylphosphine methane (dppm) moieties in the oxidised Co&#8322;(CO)&#8324;dppm species.
	Polymerisation by Sonogashira coupling between dibromo pyridines or diiodo ferrocene and ethynyl pyridines resulted in only oligomeric fractions that could be separated.
	The thesis also reports the synthesis and characterization of some novel naphthalimide monomers with acrylic and allyl headgroups. The naphthalimide moiety is substituted in the 4-position with various functionalities. This is presented in detail in Chapter 3 of the thesis. The monomers&#65533; structure is the following: [illustration omitted] wherein: A may be a polymerizable group (methacrylate or allyl), which includes a spacer entity (aliphatic or aromatic); B is selected from an ethenyl or ethynyl linked organometallic group, a halogen and/or an amine (i.e. bromo, ethynylferrocene, ethenylferrocene, trimethylsilylethynyl, nitro, piperidine and ethenylpiperidine).
	The acrylic monomers were synthesized by coupling 4-bromo-1,8-naphthalic anhydride with an amino alcohol to give an imide, which then was coupled with methacryloyl chloride to provide the methacrylate.
	Functionalization in the 4-position of the naphthalimide moieties was achieved by Sonogashira and Heck coupling reactions with for example ethynylferrocene, trimethylsilyl acetylene, vinylferrocene.
	For the allyl monomers synthesis, a reaction between allyl amine and 4-Bromo-naphthalic anhydride provided 4-bromo-naphthalimido allyl, which was then functionalized by further Sonogashira and Heck coupling reactions.
	The monomers were polymerised and copolymerised with other widely used comonomers, such as methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, styrene, vinyl carbazole and acrylonitrile. The polymerisation processes and the full analyses of the (co)polymers are described in Chapter 4.
	Free radical polymerisation, FRP, initiated by azo bisisobutyronitrile, AIBN at elevated temperature was the main technique employed for making the (co)polymers.
	Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation, ATRP was conducted for some monomers although the results were inconclusive (the yields were low, under 50%, but the molecular weight distributions were quite narrow, PDI&#65533;s &lt;1.7).
	Heck coupling polymerisation was performed for the bromo- substituted methacrylic and allyl monomers and supplied colorful, well-defined polymeric materials, with low polymerisation degrees.
	All polymers were analyzed by HPLC, NMR, UV-VIS, IR, electrochemistry and fluorescence. The (co)polymers made by FRP had various molecular masses (Mn = 3000- 90.000), whereas the polydispersities were PDI = 1.4- 4.6.
	Most of the (co)polymers were fluorescent and had good thermal and electrochemical properties. Potential applications of the polymers have been suggested and relevant literature background in the field is provided in both Chapters 1 and 4.
	The monomers/ polymers are stable compounds (no special storage conditions required) and can act as good candidates for potential applications in light emitting devices, as resins/ binders for coating materials, in the dyes and pigment industry and also for manufacturing of conducting polymers and/or composite materials.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polymers</field><field name="subject">radicals</field><field name="subject">electrochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">organocobalt compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.142806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shape modeling by swept space deformation</field><field name="creator">Angelidis, Alexis</field><field name="description">In Computer Graphics, in the context of shape modeling on a computer, a common characteristic of popular techniques is the possibility for the artist to operate on a shape by modifying directly the shape&#65533;s mathematical description. But with the constant increase of computing power, it has become increasingly realistic and effective to insert interfaces between the artist and the mathematics describing the shape. While in the future, shape descriptions are likely to be replaced with new ones, this should not affect the development of new and existing shape interfaces. Space deformation is a family of techniques that permits describing an interface independently from the description. Our thesis is that while space deformation techniques are used for solving a wide range of problems in Computer Graphics, they are missing a framework for the specific task of interactive shape modeling. We propose such a framework called sweepers, together with a set of related techniques for shape modeling. In sweepers, we define simultaneous-tools deformation, volume-preserving deformation, topology-changing deformation and animated deformation. Our swept-fluid technique introduces the idea that a deformation can be described as a fluid. In fact, the sweepers framework is not restrained to shape modeling and is also used to define a new fluid animation technique. Since the motion of a fluid can be considered locally as rigid, we define a formalism for handling conveniently rigid transformations. To display shapes, we propose a mesh update algorithm, a point-based shape description and a discrete implicit surface, and we have performed preliminary tests with inverse-raytracing. Finally, our technique called spherical-springs can be used to attach a texture to our shapes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">geometry</field><field name="subject">space deformation techniques</field><field name="subject">swept-fluid technique</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.161349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Did I say that ?" using videotapes to aid young children&#65533;s event recall</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Leigh Michelle</field><field name="description">The introduction of the Evidence Amendment Act (1989) in New Zealand allowed for children&#65533;s evidence to be videotaped and to be presented in court at a later time as evidence-in-chief. Typically, children see these tapes for the first time in court when they are required to be present for cross-examination, frequently months, or even years, after the evidence was recorded. From a theoretical perspective, allowing children to view a pre-recorded interview may be potentially beneficial, serving to remind the child of what was said at an earlier interview, and reactivating or &#65533;refreshing&#65533; the child&#65533;s memory of the event. It is also possible that viewing the videotape will have detrimental effects on children&#65533;s reports. For example, errors may be compounded when children see themselves make an error or complying with a suggestion on videotape. 
 In a series of five studies, the current thesis examined what effect, if any, viewing an earlier interview had on children&#65533;s subsequent reports about an event. In all studies presented, children took part in an event, and then were interviewed about that event 1-2 weeks later. That interview contained misinformation, which was introduced in questions. In Study 1, children watched their own videotaped interview 24 hours prior to being re-interviewed about an event in which they had participated seven months earlier. At Interview 2, the reports from these children were not very different from those of children who had no reminder, but they did report more information in free recall. 
 In Study 2, children viewed their pre-recorded interview immediately prior to Interview 2, rather than 24 hours prior, as in the first study. In addition, the delay between the event and Interview 2 was extended to 12 months. These changes were made to maximize any possible effects of the videotape as a reminder. In this study, there were greater differences between the reports of children who had, and who had not, viewed the earlier interview. These relative gains in information were not at the expense of accuracy. 
 Study 3 aimed to replicate the results of Study 2, using a larger sample. Due to circumstances beyond the Experimenter&#65533;s control, the participant number included in this study was reduced. The pattern of results in the present study was generally similar to the results observed in Study 2. 
 One group of participants participated in an additional event shortly before the end of the delay period between the interviews. This provided a unique opportunity to assess whether viewing a pre-recorded interview would assist with source monitoring, as the additional event was very similar to the first event. Study 4 examined this data. Results of this study indicated that the intervening visit interfered with the effectiveness of the pre-recorded interview as a memory aid. In addition, viewing the videotaped interview did not assist the children with source monitoring. 
 Study 5 examined whether the results from Studies 2 and 3 would generalise to a different event. The results suggested that a videotaped interview was much less effective with the different event. It is likely that this was because the event was less interactive, potentially less salient, and less familiar to the participants than the event used in the previous studies. 
 Study 6 combined the data from the previous five studies, in order to increase the statistical power. By doing this, it was anticipated that the consistent aspects of the results would become clearer, and that the inconsistent findings would be eliminated. Indeed, this study summarized the strengths of the earlier studies, and demonstrated that children&#65533;s reports at Interview 2 were enhanced when they viewed their videotape of Interview 1. This enhancement did not lead to an increased number of errors for the reminder group. 
 Taken together, these findings suggest that viewing a videotape of an earlier interview has some advantages and no detrimental effects on children&#65533;s subsequent reports. Errors spontaneously generated by the children tended to be minor, did not increase following exposure to the earlier interview, and were not repeated across the interviews. Watching a prior, videotaped interview had most benefit on increasing the information reported in free recall, and did not reduce accuracy. This is important, as free recall in interviews with children is typically accurate, but brief. Further, when asked direct questions, in some cases children who had seen a prior interview tended to be more likely to provide the correct answer. These findings are considered in the context of current legal reforms.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">memory in children</field><field name="subject">recollection (psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060809.155338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins and development of acoustic science in ancient Greece</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, Ross</field><field name="description">Studies in acoustics, in so far as sound and hearing are concerned, are evident from the middle of the 5th century B.C. in ancient Greece. The earliest extant works originated in Tarentum with Archytas, after which the fundamentals were developed in Athens, particularly by Aristotle. Aristotle&#65533;s writings represent the transition from rudimentary hypothesising to true philosophical argument, and display accuracies missing from earlier studies. 
 This study examines incipient acoustic theories from classical Greece, diachronically, presenting original translations of all relevant passages, to illustrate the development of fundamental consideration and the origins of acoustic science. 5th and 4th century texts are examined in detail, with questions of authenticity being answered where necessary, to decipher the true level and depth of knowledge on the subjects of sound and hearing. Extant Archytean material is paradigmatic, containing the nucleus of sound production underlying most models to follow, whilst relevant Platonic material embraces more difficult sound qualities, raising important questions for successors. The larger portion of this work centres upon the writings of Aristotle, whilst illustrating the debt he owes to his predecessors. Each aspect of sound and hearing is discussed in turn, based predominantly, though not exclusively, upon information sourced from Aristotle&#65533;s De Sensu and De Anima. Where pertinent, attention is given to his discussions of the full range of senses and sense organs. The result is a self-contained work tracing the origins and development of acoustic study from its fundamental beginnings to the critical point when the essential elements of a nascent science were in place and the door was opened for future enhancement and scientific verification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aristotle</field><field name="subject">De anima</field><field name="subject">De sensu et sensibilibus</field><field name="subject">Archytas of Tarentum</field><field name="subject">audiology</field><field name="subject">sound</field><field name="subject">hearing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.144633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualising attribute and spatial uncertainty in choropleth maps using hierachical spatial data models</field><field name="creator">Kardos, Julian</field><field name="description">This thesis defines a novel and intuitive method to visually represent attribute uncertainty, and spatial boundary uncertainty generated from choropleth maps. Like all data, it is not possible to know exactly how far from the truth spatial data used for choropleth mapping is. When spatial data is used in a decision-making context a visual representation of data correctness may become a valuable addition. As an example, the visualisation of uncertainty is illustrated using choropleth mapping techniques superimposed on New Zealand 2001 census data, but other spatial datasets could have been employed. Both attribute and spatial uncertainty are considered, with Monte Carlo statistical simulations being used to model attribute uncertainty. 
 A visualisation technique to manage certain choropleth spatial boundary issues (i.e. the modifiable areal unit problem - MAUP) and uncertainty in attribute data is introduced, especially catering for attribute and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty simultaneously. The new uncertainty visualisation method uses the quadtree spatial data model (SDM) in a novel manner. It is shown that by adapting the quadtree SDM to divide according to uncertainty levels possessed by attributes (associated with areal units), rather than divide on the basis of homogeneous regions (as the original quadtree design was intended), a measure of attribute and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty can be exhibited. The variable cell size of the structure expresses uncertainty, with larger cell size indicating large uncertainty, and vice versa. The new quadtree SDM was termed the trustree. A software suite called TRUST v1.0 (The Representation of Uncertainty using Scale-unspecific Tessellations) was developed to create square trustree visualisations. 
 The visual appeal and representational accuracy of the trustree was investigated. Representative accuracy and visual appeal increased when using hexagonal tessellations instead of the quadtree&#65533;s traditional square tessellation. In particular, the Hexagonal or Rhombus (HoR) quadtree designed by Bell et al. (1989) was used to programme TRUST v1.1. Using the HoR quadtree in rhombic mode (TRUST v1.1.1) produced Orbison&#65533;s optical illusion, so it was disregarded. However, the HoR trustree (the hexagonal tessellation produced by TRUST v1.1.2) was adopted for further research and user assessment. When assessed using an Internet survey, the HoR trustree adequately displayed choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty, but not attribute uncertainty. New trustree visualisations, the value-by-area (VBA) trustree and adjacent HoR trustree were developed to help increase the expression of attribute uncertainty. Upon reassessment, the new trustree visualisations were deemed usable to express attribute uncertainty and choropleth spatial boundary uncertainty at a modest 58% usable (HoR trustree), 80% usable (VBA trustree) and 85% usable (adjacent HoR trustree). A usability test (where participants were asked to spot different levels of uncertainty) validated these results, whereby the HoR trustree achieved a 65% accuracy level and the VBA trustree achieved an 80% accuracy level. The user assessments helped to highlight that the trustree could be used in two ways, to express detail within or clutter over areal units. The HoR trustree showed (1) a level of detail (or resolution) metaphor, where more detail represented more accuracy and/or the reverse, (2) a metaphor of clutter, where the data structure output was sufficiently dense as to cover spatial information, in effect hiding uncertain areas. Further Internet survey testing showed the trustree tessellation works better when representing a metaphor of detail. Attribute and spatial uncertainty can be effectively expressed depending on the tessellation level used. 
 Overall, the new TRUST suite visualisations compare favourably with existing uncertainty visualisation techniques. Some uncertainty visualisation methods consistently performed better than the TRUST visualisations such as blinking areas, adjacent value and non-continuous cartograms. Other methods like colour saturation, image sharpness and a three-dimensional surface frequently performed with less usability. Therefore, the TRUST visualisations have found their place amongst other uncertainty visualisation methods. However, survey results showed that TRUST is a viable option for visualising two forms of uncertainty - attribute and spatial uncertainty. No other visualisation method has these capabilities. Further research could include a laboratory assessment of TRUST and also incorporating vagueness and temporal uncertainty concepts. Additionally, end-user testing could provide a valuable insight into uncertainty visualisation for everyday use. Adopting uncertainty methods to uncertainty, such as the technique presented here, into the mainstream decision making environment could be considered a fundamental objective for future investigation in spatial studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">demographic surveys</field><field name="subject">census undercounts</field><field name="subject">2001 New Zealand Census</field><field name="subject">minorities</field><field name="subject">population maps</field><field name="subject">population statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.151014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of economic theory on the art of clinical practice : a study of science, meaning, and health</field><field name="creator">Muir, Lauretta</field><field name="description">In being philosophically based this thesis is concerned with understanding the human condition with particular reference to matters of meaning and how these find expression in systems of government and social policy. 
 This study is based on the premise that concepts determine how the world is viewed and people use a variety of conceptual schemes to answer different classes of questions. Scientific endeavour is based in a scheme that enables questions about the material world to be answered. It cannot however answer classes of questions related to many features of human lives as its methods necessitate the development and use of abstractions and generalisations that are ill-equipped by design to determine what is important to people and what motivates and satisfies them. Therefore, the reality of any particular individual or group cannot be adequately understood in scientific terms. 
 The thesis examines the scientific conceptual framework and minimalist abstractions of the medical model and the quasi-scientific conceptual frameworks of economics and identifies their conceptual limits. It shows that if the medical model is assumed to provide a complete representation of realities in health and is uncritically used as the basis of medical practice it has the potential to overlook the patient as a person and distance medical practice from its social roots which can lead to adverse outcomes for both clinical practice and medicine itself. It also observes that the economic scheme has conceptual limits that create their own distorted representations of reality. A similar dislocation in the meaning of people&#65533;s lives occurs when abstractions are made by adopting concepts from other schemes based in science, such as the medical model, without any awareness of their conceptual limits. Further distortions occur when these other accounts are turned into economic ones. Not only is the patient as a person overlooked, so is the patient as an entity. 
 In light of these observations the thesis examines health reforms that have taken place in New Zealand, whereby the economic scheme has been given dominance in the development of public policy and set the parameters for rationality and what can acceptably be said. It shows that in not recognising features of meaning these parameters have led to health sector reforms that have had unintended and adverse consequences for clinical practice, as shown in the particular case of reforms of maternity services. Furthermore these reforms have severed the health sector from its social roots and moral frameworks and created barriers between it and government so that health sector problems that cannot be understood using economic parameters cannot be addressed in forums where public policy is developed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical medicine</field><field name="subject">health care reform</field><field name="subject">medical policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060911.160405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflections on ice : scattering of flexural gravity waves by irregularities in Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets</field><field name="creator">Williams, Timothy D. C.</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the scattering properties of different types of imperfections in large Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. Such irregularities include cracks, pressure ridges and both open and refrozen leads. The scattering by a transition region between sea ice and a very thick ice shelf, for example as is found in the Ross Sea in Antarctica, is also treated. 
 Methods of solution are based on applications of Green&#65533;s theorem to the appropriate situation, which leads to either a single integral equation or a pair of coupled integral equations to be solved at the boundary between the ice and the sea water. Those equations over a finite interval are solved using numerical quadrature, while those over semi-infinite ranges are solved using the Wiener-Hopf method. Results calculated using different techniques are able to be checked against each other, giving us great confidence in their accuracy. In particular, the scattering by three ice sheets of different thicknesses is confirmed analytically by mode-matching coupled with the residue calculus technique. 
 The scattering by the single irregularities is investigated partly for its own sake, and partly with the aim of using it to treat the scattering when large numbers of features are included in a single ice sheet. The principal objective of doing this is to observe the change in the general amounts of reflection and transmission as the background ice thickness is changed. There is enough variation in our results for us to conclude that there is definite potential for using the change in an incident wave spectrum after passing through a given ice field to estimate the background ice thickness.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity waves</field><field name="subject">ice mechanics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Arctic Regions</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060907.120444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coaching in the 'current' : the climate of an elite men&#65533;s rowing training programme</field><field name="creator">Purdy, Laura Grace</field><field name="description">The climate of sport has been undervalued as a contributing factor in athletes&#65533; achievement of quality performances (Strean, 1995). Subsequently, the aim of this study was to generate insight into the climate created by New Zealand national rowing coaches in an elite men&#65533;s training programme. In particular, the participants&#65533; (i.e. coaches, athletes and administrators) interpretation of this climate was sought, with specific attention to the factors which enabled and constrained its development. 
 This study relied upon ethnographic research methods using in-depth interviews, reflexive journals and observations to acquire a 'thick description' (Geertz, 1973) of the behaviour of the administrators, coaches and athletes in the programme and how that behaviour was interpreted. Data were collected over a five month period, as the athletes prepared for the upcoming Olympic trials. The participants in the study were two administrators, three coaches and eleven athletes. 
 The data were primarily analysed using concepts from grounded theory (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990) and, in light of the prevalence of structural and agential factors in the creation of the climate, Giddens&#65533; (1979, 1984) structuration theory. Hence, two of the three discussion chapters are principally organised around the modalities of structuration theory, namely interpretative schemes and norms (Giddens, 1979). The third discussion chapter focuses on the concept of power. In this chapter I draw upon the work of Bourdieu (1989), Foucault (1977), Giddens (1984), Nyberg (1981) and Shilling (1991) to help explain the power dynamics in the training programme. 
 Most significantly, it was found that all participants relied heavily upon their previous experience to interpret what it meant to be involved in the elite programme as well as how they were 'supposed' to act. Whilst each participant had an idea of how they were meant to behave, they also acted in ways which were dictated by the rowing community and the traditions in the sport that were considered to be normative practices. In addition, the participants also had expectations of each other&#65533;s behaviour. Often however, these were not congruent with the actual behaviours, resulting in a degree of frustration. Frustration also stemmed from the power dynamic which existed between the members of the programme. Although the coaches&#65533; role enabled them to exercise their power when working with the athletes, the athletes also exercised their power by sometimes defying the coaches&#65533; orders. Additionally, the administrators drew upon their authority to ensure their particular agenda was met, often at the expense of the coaches and athletes. This, not surprisingly, had implications on the climate of the programme as it affected the athletes&#65533; ability to trust those leading the programme which, in turn, affected their desire to train hard. The resulting climate was characterised by a degree of apathy on the part of the athletes which undoubtedly had consequences on their ability to support the programme and excel within it. 
 This research extends previous work in the coaching science community by examining the various layers of social interaction within the sporting environment. It highlights the interrelated, interdependent and sometimes problematic nature of relationships that construct and influence the climate of a training programme. The findings of this research support the importance of climate and raise the possibility it has on athlete performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rowing</field><field name="subject">coaching</field><field name="subject">training</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061018.165626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantic processing in Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Vickie Ellen</field><field name="description">Parkinson&#65533;s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is typically characterised in terms of its debilitating effects on motor function. However, ubiquitous neuropsychological deficits are also an integral feature of the progression of this disease. This thesis investigated these cognitive deficits as they manifest in language, with the overarching goal being to elucidate the word-finding problems that are associated with Parkinson&#65533;s disease. Making semantic judgements and identifying semantic relations are two processes that are particularly germane to word-finding. Therefore, the present thesis examined: 1) the ability of people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease to make judgements about semantic categories, and 2) the integrity of associative semantic networks in Parkinson&#65533;s disease. In the first series of studies, Cups and Bowls, a novel semantic categorisation task was used to investigate the ability of people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease to consistently categorise common kitchen items across a number of trials. The Parkinson&#65533;s group was impaired relative to an age-matched control group on this task. This inconsistent categorisation was particularly apparent for the less typical category exemplars at the category boundaries, suggesting that the Parkinson&#65533;s group had less salient or less elaborated semantic categories, which particularly compromised categorisation of the less typical category exemplars. This finding is discussed in terms of selective attention deficits and inappropriate weightings of semantic features. 
 In the second series of studies, Verbal Memory, the structure of the semantic network and access to the semantic system were further investigated using a verbal memory task, which required participants to recall word lists. These word lists consisted of semantically associated words and were designed to elicit false recall of another, non-presented, close semantic associate (the critical lure). The results of this second series of studies, particularly the fact that the Parkinson&#65533;s group recalled more of the false critical lures than the control group, suggested an intact semantic network in Parkinson&#65533;s disease and normal saliency of semantic categories. The potentiated false recall effect in the Parkinson&#65533;s group is discussed in terms of poor modulation of attention in Parkinson&#65533;s disease, both as the result of an executive deficit leading to poor controlled processing and in terms of a dopamine-modulated decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio leading to impaired automatic processing. Taken together, the results reported in the present thesis suggest that basal ganglia pathology and striatofrontal deafferentation in Parkinson&#65533;s disease do not diminish the integrity of semantic memory, but do compromise operation of semantic memory due to impaired modulation of activation/inhibition mechanisms. This finding of a selective attention deficit has implications for word-finding, suggesting that the word-finding difficulties associated with Parkinson&#65533;s disease are the result of impaired lexical access. In particular, retrieval of specific lexical items from semantic memory is impeded because of failure to modulate activation/inhibition mechanisms effectively for the target word to be distinguished from close semantic associates. An intact semantic checking mechanism in anterior language cortex prevents the production of semantic paraphasias, and results in the tip-of-the-tongue word-finding problems displayed by some people with Parkinson&#65533;s disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">speech disorders</field><field name="subject">semantics</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.112547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raffaello Squarise (1856-1945) : the colonial career of an Italian maestro</field><field name="creator">Murray, David</field><field name="description">This work examines the life of Raffaello Squarise (1856-1945), an Italian maestro who was a leading musician in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand, from 1889 until his retirement in 1933. Squarise worked as a professional in a predominantly amateur musical environment, and this thesis demonstrates his widely-felt presence and discernible influence in Dunedin&#65533;s cultural life, through his activities as a violinist, teacher, conductor, and composer. Furthermore, it illustrates the nature of the active musical culture in Dunedin, through Squarise&#65533;s participation in established local practices and the contrast provided by the &#65533;otherness&#65533; of his Italian ethnicity. The thesis shows that a two-way adaptive process took place between Squarise and the Dunedin community, as each engaged with the unfamiliar culture of the other. The success of Squarise&#65533;s musical career in the antipodes, it is argued, was based upon his willingness to adapt to the cultural, intellectual, and musical environment of his adopted home. 
 The method used in this study is that of interpretative biography: it conveys the experience of the individual while emphasizing context through the subject&#65533;s interaction with his environment. The sources of the research are mainly archival, and include Squarise&#65533;s personal papers, newspapers, the archives of local music organizations, and music ephemera. These are augmented by interviews undertaken with some of the few people (nearly sixty years since his death) who knew Squarise. The thesis is a study of the public more than the private man, but the sources are extensive enough to provide a thorough representation of Squarise&#65533;s professional activities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rafaello Squarise (1856-1945)</field><field name="subject">New Zealand musicians</field><field name="subject">New Zealand composers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.140003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of cognitive styles on the interaction with a language instruction CD-ROM : a case study of Malaysian ESL learners</field><field name="creator">Ng, Lee-Luan</field><field name="description">Computer technology has been introduced into the field of language education for more than three decades. However, how individual learners interact with language learning multimedia programmes in different ways is not yet understood. A possible explanation is related to the learners&#65533; variables. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of cognitive style, one of these variables, on the language learning process. The participants of this study were a group of ESL university students from Malaysia, who interacted with a language instruction CD-ROM. This study focuses on investigating the interaction process from the students&#65533; perspective. 
 Riding&#65533;s Cognitive Style Analysis, a computer software that measures individual&#65533;s cognitive style, was used to assist in identifying and categorizing students&#65533; cognitive style. Thirty students&#65533; cognitive style was measured before each student spent an average of three hours interacting with a language instruction CD-ROM. This study adopts the case study approach. The primary method of collecting data involved semi-structured interviews with students that focused on their experiences and preferences while interacting with language instruction CD-ROM. Factors that affected the interaction process were then examined to detect whether they were linked to the differences of students&#65533; cognitive orientation. 
 The findings of this study reflect the mixed results that previous researchers have found regarding the effect of cognitive style on students&#65533; language learning experiences. Although responses toward the content, graphics and vocabulary items did partially reflect their cognitive orientation, cognitive style was not the only factor that influenced these students&#65533; behaviours or preferences as they interacted with the language instruction CD-ROM. The study found factors that were not linked to the students&#65533; cognitive styles, yet these also influenced the interaction process. These non-cognitive-style factors consisted of students&#65533; language learning motivation, social presence, and their conception of language learning and cultural influence, which resulted in teacher-centeredness.

In particular, I addressed the gender symmetry debate, and identified factors associated with the dynamics of violent relationships by examining the correlates related to perpetrating and suffering IPV for both men and women. Finally, I examined attitudes towards IPV, communication behaviour, and conflict management techniques as a function of abuse history. Participants were recruited from three samples of the New Zealand population (student, general, and incarcerated). The inclusion of an incarcerated sample enabled the examination of more severe, frequent and injurious violence than is typically experienced within the student and general samples. 
 There were three phases to the study. The first phase explored incidence rates and psychological correlates of IPV. As expected, the incidence of IPV was highest within the incarcerated sample (Chapter 5). Of greater significance, the incidence of IPV was similar for males and females, with the majority of violence being bi-directional (Chapters 4 &amp; 5). Moreover, the psychological correlates associated with IPV were similar for perpetrators and victims, and males and females (Chapters 4 &amp; 5). 
 Due to the bi-directional nature of IPV, analyses presented in Chapters 4 and 5 were limited by the categorisation of participants as both perpetrators and victims. In Chapter 6, I overcame this limitation. The attitudes of victims were examined separately to individuals experiencing bi-directional violence. Validating the findings of Chapters 4 and 5, the attitudes and behaviours of victims and perpetrators were similar. These included being more hostile and negative towards others and ones&#65533; partner, being more controlling, and reporting more communication problems. I also further explored gender symmetry in IPV. Male and female IPV was found to be similar in frequency, severity, and similarly associated with control. However, the type of acts perpetrated differed across gender. 
 During the second and third phase of the study, I further examined participants&#65533; communication behaviour (Chapter 7), conflict behaviour, and attitudes (Chapter 8). Findings revealed that perpetrators and victims employed less facilitative and polite linguistic devices (Chapter 7) and reported fewer skills for dealing with conflict (Chapter 8) than did other individuals. An examination of attitudes towards IPV revealed males and females had similar attitudes and were more condoning of female, than male-perpetrated IPV. Moreover, individuals with a history of IPV were the most condoning of violence. Additionally, a number of correlates associated with experiencing IPV were also associated with attitudes condoning IPV (Chapter 8). 
 Overall, the findings revealed IPV to be bi-directional and gender symmetrical. Male and female IPV was similar in incidence, severity, and injury. Furthermore, the psychological correlates associated with IPV were similar for men and women, and perpetrators and victims. Individuals with a history of IPV were more controlling, hostile towards others, more condoning of IPV, employed less positive communication styles, and lacked skills for dealing with conflict. In light of these findings, suggestions are offered for violence prevention initiatives in the discussion sections of each chapter and in the final chapter (Chapter 9).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marital violence</field><field name="subject">female offenders</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.151154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking selves : dialogue and identity in Milton&#65533;s major poems</field><field name="creator">Liebert, Elisabeth Mary</field><field name="description">In his Dialogue on the State of a Christian Man (1597), William Perkins articulated the popular early-modern understanding that the individual is a "double person" organised under "spiritual" and "temporal" regiments. In the one, he is a person "under Christ" and must endeavour to become Christ-like; in the other, he is a person "in respect of" others and bound to fulfil his duties towards them. This early-modern self, governed by relationships and the obligations they entail, was profoundly vulnerable to the formative influence of speech, for relationships themselves were in part created and sustained through social dialogue. Similarly, the individual could hope to become "a person...under Christ" only by hearing spiritual speech - Scripture preached or read, or the "secret soule-whisperings" of the Spirit. The capacity of speech to effect real and lasting change in the auditor was a commonplace in seventeenth-century England: the conscious crafting of identity, dramatised by Stephen Greenblatt in Renaissance Self-Fashioning, occurred daily in domestic and social transactions, in the exchange of civilities, the use of apostrophe, and strategies of praise. It happened when friends or strangers met, when host greeted guest, or the signatory to a letter penned vocatives that defined his addressee. It lacked a sense of high drama but was nonetheless calculated and effective. 
 Speaking Selves proposes that examining the impact of speech upon the "double person" not only contributes to our understanding of selfhood in the seventeenth century, but also, and more importantly, leads to new insights into some of that century&#65533;s greatest literary artefacts: Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes. The first chapter turns to conduct manuals and conversion narratives, to speech-act theory and discourse analysis, and draws out those verbal strategies that contributed to the organisation of social and spiritual selves. Chapter 2 turns to Paradise Lost and traces the Father&#65533;s gradual revelation to the Son, through apostrophe, how he is to reflect, how enact the divine being whose visible and verbal expression he is. Chapter 3 discusses advice on address behaviour in seventeenth-century marriage treatises; it reveals the positive contribution of generous apostrophe and verbal mirroring to Adam and Eve&#65533;s Edenic marriage. The conversational dyads in heaven and prelapsarian Eden enact positive identities for their collocutors. Satan, however, begetting himself by diabolical speech-act, discovers the ability of words to dismantle the identity of others. Chapter 4 traces the development of his deceptive strategies, drawing attention to his wilful misrepresentation of social identity as a means to pervert the spiritual identity of his collocutor. The final chapter explores the reorganisation of the complex social-spiritual person in the postlapsarian world. We watch the protagonist of Samson discriminate between the many voices that attempt to impose upon him their own understanding of selfhood. Drawing on spiritual autobiographies as structurally and thematically analogous to Milton&#65533;s drama, this final chapter traces the inward plot of Samson as its fallen hero redefines identity and rediscovers the "intimate impulse" of the Spirit that alone can complete the reorganisation of the spiritual self.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Milton (1608-1674)</field><field name="subject">dialogue in literature</field><field name="subject">identity (psychology) in literature</field><field name="subject">self in literature</field><field name="subject">religion in literature</field><field name="subject">Christianity in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061106.160106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te mana Maori : Te tatari i nga korero parau</field><field name="creator">Hokowhitu, Brendan J.</field><field name="description">This thesis has three primary objectives: to deconstruct the genealogical representation of Maori as a physical, unintelligent and savage people, to examine the role that education, and particularly physical education has played in perpetuating these representations by channelling Maori into physical curriculum areas, and to provide a functional kaupapa Maori philosophy of health and physical education.
	Postmodern theory underpins this theses because it encourages the search for multiple truths. In the colonial context, specifically, it provides an ideal tool by which to deconstruct the supposedly objective and preordained single truths of the colonisers. As I demonstrate, these single truths proved to be politically motivated and false. I also employ a Foucauldian understanding of European history to describe how European bourgeois nationalism and normalisation mutated into biopower, where the normalised Self was able to control, limit, describe and kill the Other.
	Travellers, missionaries and settlers transposed biopower from Europe to colonial New Zealand. Later, descriptions of the Other - or rather the juxtapositioning of the Self next to depictions of the primitive/anti Other - by anthropologists and historians aided this process. For the benefit of enlightened liberals, colonisation in New Zealand required a specific rhetoric to recast ruthless aspects of the process as mere anomalies on the road to Utopia. The modernist Western world validated colonisation under the guises of humanism and progress: the savage, primitive, pre-philosophical Maori provided the perfect contrast against the civilised, mature, philosophical Self. This genealogical representation formed the basis for Pakeha and Maori relations - and continues to do so.
	Representations of Maori as intrinsically unintelligent and physical, framed politically motivated educational policy. Initially, racist educational directives channelled Maori into physical vocations to provide labour for untamed rural New Zealand. In the 1960&#65533;s and &#65533;70&#65533;s, racially biased intelligence test were employed to debiltate Maori students by streaming them into non-academic classes. Later, the so-called empowering rhetoric of the neo-colonial era informed curricula by promoting diluted and sanitised versions of tikanga Maori such as Taha Maori, its physical education offshoot Te Reo Kori, and the current New Zealand Health and Physical Education Curriculum. Promoted under the liberal banner of biculturalism, these initiatives primarily benefited Pakeha and further misrepresented Maori culture as simplistic and irrelevent to contemporary society.
	Deconstructing grand narratives encourages researchers to construct knowledge outside such totalising truths. Thus, the theoretical approach and historical disseminations outlined above provide the foundations for part two of this thesis, which is a contribution towards Maori knowledge. Employing an interpretivist, indepth interviewing and collaborative narrative epistemology, I constructed korero with kaumatua and pakeke. These focus on health and physical education from a Maori position. Subsequent discussion examines certain aspects of each korero, to form a functional Maori philosophy of physical activity delineated by hauora, a Maori notion of holistic health. The discussion also outlines a number of issues surrounding the incorporation of tikanga Maori into mainstream education.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deconstruction</field><field name="subject">acculturation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061214.144753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A defence of non-introspective simulationism</field><field name="creator">Ogle, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis is a defence of non-introspective simulationism. It seeks to explain how we acquire everyday behavioural and psychological beliefs (henceforth interpretational beliefs) regarding both ourselves and others. The thesis is in three parts; the first states non-introspective simulationism, the second surveys some relevant empirical findings and shows how simulationism explains (or at least accomodates) these, and the third compares simulationism with rival theories. 
 The two main claims of non-introspecitve simulationism (as defended) are: simulation is central to the acquisition of interpretational beliefs. Introspection has no role whatever. 
 Further central claims are: beliefs about our own currently intended behaviours are acquired by practical reasoning. Other interpretational beliefs are, in various ways, the product of simulation. Simulation requires little if any machinery not already required for practical reasoning. Knowledge of our own psychological states is acquired after and as a result of knowledge of others&#65533;.

Determining habitat suitability in endangered species is important for the success of translocation as a conservation tool. In addition, understanding mechanisms (source/sink system versus ecological traps) that drive habitat selection in translocated animals may be critical to population viability. In New Zealand, where ecosystems are highly vulnerable to extinction, habitat restoration on predator-free off-shore islands is an important recovery tool. Therefore, there is a need to understand the relationship between the establishment of the translocated populations and the characteristics of their new environment. 
 Previous research indicated that re-introduced populations of Stewart Island robin (Petroica australis rakiura - Toutouwai) and South Island saddleback (Philesternus carunculatus carunculatus - Tieke) on Ulva Island (Stewart Island), New Zealand, showed preferences for coastal habitats that were characterized by low-lying dense vegetation and open ground cover. In this study, we further investigated territorial establishment in these two populations since re-introduction and looked at how birds utilised the landscape. I hypothesised that sites colonised soon after re-introduction were of high quality and later on, birds moved into unsuitable habitats. I defined habitat quality at a micro-scale in terms of vegetation structure, nest characteristics and food availability. I modeled bird presence and nesting success in relation to habitat components to determine factors in the environment that influenced breeding site selection and contributed to successful nesting in these two species. I discussed results in comparison to similar bird-habitat models developed for the South Island saddleback population on Motuara Island (Marlborough Sounds) and examined explanatory variables in each model. 
 Translocated birds in the three studied populations first established territories in coastal scrub, and in the following years moved into larger coastal forest stands. Although vegetation structure was the primary variable explaining site selection in these populations, vegetation composition should still be considered important as it dictated the suitability of nesting substrate and the availability of food items. There was no evidence that first-colonised areas were more suitable habitats, and I concluded that these cases could not be used as examples of ecological traps. Instead, results suggested that with increased density robins and saddlebacks on Ulva have more recently settled in sites less suitable to nesting and foraging, thus underlying a source/sink structure. However, the sparse distribution of food items on Motuara contributed to a lack of territorial behavior and environmental effect on breeding success; therefore a source/sink system could not be confirmed in this population. I recommended that future translocation sites give preference to mixed-size stands with broadleaved species that are characterised by dense canopy below 4 m height and with suitable cavities in live trees. Lastly, due to robins&#65533; and saddlebacks&#65533; attraction to conspecifics and their territorial behavior, resources evenly distributed across the landscape could also increase their survival and reproductive success.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">introduced birds</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Ulva Island (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island robin</field><field name="subject">South Island saddleback</field><field name="subject">Creadion carunculatus</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070118.143501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the population dynamics and viability analysis of franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) and Hector&#65533;s dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) under the effects of bycatch in fisheries, parameter uncertainty and stochasticity</field><field name="creator">Secchi, Eduardo Resende</field><field name="description">Incidental mortality in fisheries, especially gillnets, is one of the most important causes of decline of many species of cetaceans around the globe. Local populations of franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, and Hector&#65533;s dolphins, Cephalorhynchus hectori, have been subject to high levels of mortality in gillnets for several decades. This is due to a combination of extensive overlap in distribution of these coastal dolphins and large numbers of fishing nets. 
 Stage-specific population dynamic models (without environmental stochasticity) suggest that both species have a low potential for population growth of approximately 0.2% (95% CI: -3.7% to 4.2%) to 3.4% (95% CI: 1.6% to 6.4%) for franciscana and 0.85% (95% CI: -1.0% to 2.6%) for Hector&#65533;s dolphins. Although the two species have similar population growth rates, they result from different life history strategies. Franciscana has a relatively low adult survival rate (0.86; SD = 0.016) which is compensated by a relatively high reproductive potential. The latter is a combination of early reproduction and high fecundity. Hector&#65533;s dolphin has a low reproductive potential, which is a combination of late reproduction and low fecundity, which is probably compensated by a relatively high adult survival rate (0.92; SD = 0.02) Apparent differences in growth rate among franciscana populations are possibly due to a combination of varying population-specific reproductive potential and, in some populations, inaccuracy in parameter estimates. Inaccuracy in estimating natural survival rates is also a cause for the low growth rate of Hector&#65533;s dolphins. 
 The estimated low population growth rates of these species are insufficient to compensate for current levels of fishing-related mortality in some local populations, especially when environmental and/or demographic stochasticity is considered. Under these circumstances Banks Peninsula population would have a negative mean population growth rate of 0.54% (95% CI: -2.2% to 0.9%) and would decrease below its initial size in approximately 74% of the simulations. Stochasticity alone would decrease considerably the probability of the Banks Peninsula population to grow and recover from past and current high bycatch levels. Effects of stochasticity were also high for one of the franciscana stocks (i.e. stock from Franciscana Management Area II). In other areas (e.g. West Coast of the South Island; franciscana stock from FMA I) fishing effort and bycatch mortality rate seem not to be impeding population growth. Even in a stochastic environment and under current levels of fishing effort, the West Coast population and the franciscana stock from FMA I would grow at a positive rate of 0.32% (95% CI: -1.2% to 1.8%) and 3.1% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.2%), respectively. Parameter uncertainty does not change the conclusion that immediate and extreme limitations on fishing practice and effort are necessary to increase the chances of recovery for some local populations/stocks. 
 Fishing effort in New Zealand is regulated by a quota system. The quota system, the low number of fishing boats and the relatively low overlap between fishing nets and dolphins are probably the reasons for the positive population growth of Hector&#65533;s dolphins from the West Coast of the South Island. On the other hand, not even the Marine Mammal Sanctuary is sufficient to avoid negative mean population growth rate of Hector&#65533;s dolphins under current levels of fishing effort off Banks Peninsula. In Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, where franciscana occurs, gillnet fisheries are not regulated. In some areas, faced with a declining fish stocks, fishermen have increased fishing effort to compensate for reduced catches, and the bycatch of franciscana has increased as a consequence. Strategies aiming at the conservation of these two species are likely to benefit other components of the ecosystem. Especially in the case of franciscana, reducing fishing effort is likely to promote the recovery of depleted fish stocks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">La Plata dolphin</field><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">bycatches (fisheries)</field><field name="subject">population ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070118.162020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the effect of EIA : the influence of environmental effects information on resource consent decision-making in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schijf, Bobbi</field><field name="description">Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was introduced to inform decision-makers of the potential environmental effects of the decision before them. It has been adopted worldwide and functions as one of the primary instruments for taking account of environmental consequences in project approval decision-making. To date, there has been very little systematic investigation that explores whether the decision-makers for whom the EIA information is produced actually use it, although there are indications that EIA information is not always effective in influencing decisions. This thesis examines how, and indeed if, environmental effects information influences the decision-making processes for which it is produced, and which factors determine the use of this information. Three main areas of concern are identified and investigated: the responses of individual decision-makers to environmental effects information; the characteristics of the effects information that influence these responses; and the processes by which the effects information is dealt with. 
 At the core of the methodology employed for this research is the development of an exploratory model of EIA-based decision-making. This model builds on the insights into decision processes from a variety of disciplines, including psychology and planning. To test the utility of the model, it is evaluated against the New Zealand system of resource consent approval decision-making under the Resource Management Act, by means of case studies. Through interviews, direct observation, and analysis of written documents the decision processes in these cases are analysed. These techniques have been augmented by psychosocial methods that allow further probing into the decision processes that takes place in a decision-maker&#65533;s head. 
 The research results show that the effort that is spent on the preparation of EIA reports and the improvement of EIA processes is not wasted. The EIA information clearly influences the decision processes for which it is intended but it is not influencing decisions optimally. EIA information often competes with information on environmental effects from other sources that is of higher quality, more credible, or better tailored to the decision-makers&#65533; information needs. A number of ways in which the use of EIA information could be enhanced is explored in this thesis. Foremost, the improvement of the effectiveness of EIA requires a wider adoption of a decision-making perspective on EIA, and a broader recognition of the information needs of the different decision processes for which EIA is prepared.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis</field><field name="subject">environmental policy</field><field name="subject">environmental law</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070202.121126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accuracy in the diagnosis of lumbar segmental mobility disorders</field><field name="creator">Abbott, J. Haxby</field><field name="description">Background: In the clinical examination of patients with low back pain (LBP), musculoskeletal physiotherapists routinely assess lumbar spinal segmental motion by performing physical examination procedures such as observation of active range of motion and palpation of intervertebral motion. The validity of manual assessment of segmental motion, however, has not been adequately investigated. 
 Methods: In this pragmatic, multi-centre, criterion-related validity study, 138 consecutive patients with LBP were recruited and examined by physiotherapists with postgraduate training in musculoskeletal manual therapy. Clinicians examined each patient&#65533;s spine for the presence of segmental motion abnormalities, described as lumbar segmental rigidity (LSR) and lumbar segmental instability (LSI), then referred the patients for flexion-extension (FE) radiographs. The physical examination procedures of interest were: 1) assessment of forward-bending (FB) active range of motion (AROM); 2) FB and backward-bending (BB) passive physiological intervertebral motion testing (PPIVMs) in the sagittal plane; and 3) central postero-anterior passive accessory intervertebral motion testing (PAIVMs). Sagittal displacement kinematics of the lumbar spinal segments were measured from the FE radiographs, and served as the criterion standard against which the clinical assessment results were compared. The kinematic parameters measured were sagittal rotation, sagittal translation, ratio of translation per degree of rotation (TRR), instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR), and centre of reaction (CR). Reference ranges for normal motion were calculated from the analysis of FE radiographs of 30 asymptomatic volunteers. The accuracy and validity of the clinical examination procedures were then calculated, and reported as sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for a positive test (LR+) and a negative test (LR-). 
 Results: In patients with LBP, sagittal rotation LSR and sagittal translation LSR had a prevalence of approximately 5.7% (p &lt;0.0005) in this cohort. Sagittal rotation LSI was not found in statistically significant numbers. Sagittal translation LSI was found at a prevalence of 3.6% (p &lt;0.05). Abnormal TRR (23.3%), IAR (17.7%), and CR (16.5%) were more prevalent findings (all p &lt;0.0005). Observation of the quantity of AROM, during FB, is not valid for the assessment of either total lumbar segmental sagittal rotation, or detection of individual segments with abnormal segmental motion. PPIVMs and PAIVMs are specific, but not sensitive, for the detection of rotation LSI and translation LSI. A positive test (grade 4 on a scale from 0 to 4) with BB PPIVMs may have some utility for the diagnosis of rotation LSI or translation LSI, with LR+ of 8.4 and 7.1 respectively (and 95% CIs from around 1.7 to 38). Likelihood ratio statistics for FB PPIVMs were not statistically significant. A positive test (grade 2 on a scale from 0 to 2) with PAIVMs may have some utility for the diagnosis of rotation LSI or translation LSI, with LR+ of 2.7 and 2.5 respectively (and 95% CIs from around 1.01 to 7.5). Neither PPIVMs nor PAIVMs were useful for the detection of LSR, or abnormal quality of motion as measured by TRR, CR, and IAR. 
 Conclusions: Abnormal spinal segmental motion is associated with the symptom of LBP, in patients presenting to physiotherapists with a new episode of recurrent or chronic LBP, however prevalence is low due to highly variable lumbar segmental motion among asymptomatic individuals. Manual physical examination has moderate validity, but limited utility on its own, for the detection of translation LSI. Further research should investigate the utility of other clinical examination findings for the detection of lumbar segmental mobility disorders.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backache</field><field name="subject">low back pain</field><field name="subject">lumbar vertebrae</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.094640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A partitioned narrative model of the self : its linguistic manifestations, entailments, and ramifications</field><field name="creator">Pang, Kam-yiu S.</field><field name="description">Contrary to common folk and expert theory, the human self is not unitary. There is no Cartesian theatre or homunculus functioning as a metaphorical overlord. Rather, it is an abstractum gleaned from a person&#65533;s experiences-a centre of narrative gravity (Dennett 1991). Experiences are a person&#65533;s cognisance of her ventures in life from a particular unique perspective. In perspectivising her experiences, the person imputes a certain structure, order, and significance to them. Events are seen as unfolding in a certain inherently and internally coherent way characterised by causality, temporality, or intentionality, etc. In other words, a person&#65533;s self emerges out of her innumerable narrativisations of experience, as well as the different protagonist roles she plays in them. Her behaviours in different situations can be understood as different life-narratives being foregrounded, when she is faced with different stimuli different experiences/events present. 
 In real life, self-reflective discourse frequently alludes to a divided, partitive self, and the experiences/behaviours that it can engage in. In academic study, this concept of the divided and narrative-constructivist self is well-represented in disciplines ranging from philosophy (e.g., Dennett 1991, 2005), developmental psychology (e.g., Markus &amp; Nurius 1986; Bruner 1990, 2001; Stern 1994), cognitive psychology (e.g., Hermans &amp; Kempen 1993; Hermans 2002), neuropsychology (e.g. Damasio 1999), psychiatry (e.g., Feinberg 2001), to linguistics (e.g., McNeil 1996; Ochs &amp; Capps 1996; Nair 2003). Depending on the particular theory, however, emphasis is often placed either on its divided or its narrative-constructivist nature. This thesis argues, however, that the two are coexistent and interdependent, and both are essential to the self&#65533;s ontology. Its objectives are therefore: (i) to propose a partitioned-narrative model of the self which unifies the two perspectives by positing that the partitioned-representational (Dinsmore 1991) nature of narratives entails the partitioned structure of the self; and (ii) to propose that the partitioned-narrative ontology of the self is what enables and motivates much of our self-reflective discourse and the grammatical resources for constructing that discourse. Partitioning guarantees that a part of the self, i.e., one of its narratives, can be selectively attended to, foregrounded, objectified, and hence talked about. Narrativity provides the contextual guidance and constraints for meaning-construction in such discourse. This claim is substantiated with three application cases: the use of anaphoric reflexives (I found myself smiling); various usages of proper names, including eponyms (the Shakespeare of architecture), eponymic denominal adjectives (a Herculean effort), etc.; and partitive-self constructions which explicitly profile partitioned and selectively focal narratives (That&#65533;s his hormones talking). When analysed using the proposed model, these apparently disparate behaviours turn out to share a common basis: the partitioned-narrative self.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">narrative discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">self-consciousness</field><field name="subject">psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070213.103815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adsorption of heavy metals by waste tea and coffee residues</field><field name="creator">Utomo, Handojo Djati</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the use of natural waste materials, specifically used tea leaves and coffee grounds, as adsorbents for the removal of trace metals from water, e.g. in waste water treatment. Trace metals such as lead, mercury, zinc, copper, nickel and cadmium are released to the environment in waste water as a result of human activities, and generate concern because of their potential toxicity, persistence and tendency to become concentrated in food chains. While there are many conventional methods for removing these metals from waste water, such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, membrane technologies and electrochemical treatment, these processes can be expensive. Thus in recent years there has been increasing interest in low cost adsorbent materials as alternative adsorbents, particularly waste natural products such as rice hulls and spent coffee grounds. 
 Most of the research reported in this thesis has been conducted with spent coffee grounds, both grounds produced by leaching of commercial ground coffee and spent grounds obtained from the manufacture of instant coffee. However, some preliminary work was also conducted using spent tea leaves. 
 In the initial work, the adsorption of the metal ions Cu&#65533;&#8314;, Zn&#65533;&#8314;, Cd&#65533;&#8314; and Pb&#65533;&#8314; by these adsorbents was investigated using batch adsorption methods to determine the effects of pH, metal ion concentration, adsorbent concentration and other factors such as temperature and metal ion competition. The competitive effects of soluble material leached from the adsorbents that also bind metal ions were studied. 
 The adsorption of the metal ions was found to follow the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. However, the maximum adsorption density was found to depend on the concentration of coffee adsorbent present. Further investigation indicated that this was a result of flocculation of the coffee solids, which acted to reduce the available surface area and thus the maximum density of adsorption sites. This was confirmed using a dispersant to break up the flocculated solids. 
 Column adsorption studies showed that metal ions adsorbed by coffee grounds could be quantitatively leached in dilute acid solution without any loss of subsequent adsorption properties, thus promoting efficient re-use of the column for many adsorption cycles. The adsorbent was also found to be largely unaffected by biological degradation. A prototype waste water treatment column was used to treat tap water samples, with and without known additions of metal ions. The results showed that the grounds efficiently adsorbed trace metal contaminants at levels as low as [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;. 
 The acid base chemistry of both tea leaves and coffee grounds, and the soluble materials leached from the fresh tea and coffee, were studied using potentiometric titration. In addition the stoichiometry of H&#8314; released during metal ion adsorption was also investigated. The latter results indicated that the stoichiometry of metal ion adsorption is not simple, i.e. it probably involves more than one type of adsorption site. 
 The results of this thesis suggest that the use of waste coffee grounds shows considerable promise for the treatment of waste water containing trace metals, and provides an alternative commercial use for such exhausted coffee materials.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">absorption and adsorption</field><field name="subject">tea</field><field name="subject">coffee</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">sewage purification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070207.132040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Burning out or burning desire? : investigating athlete burnout and engagement in elite New Zealand athletes</field><field name="creator">Lonsdale, Christopher Sean</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the utility of Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2002) as a framework for understanding athlete burnout and its hypothesized opposite - athlete engagement. Athlete burnout was defined as "a psychological syndrome of emotional/physical exhaustion, reduced sense of accomplishment, and sport devaluation" (Raedeke, 1997, p.398). Athlete engagement was defined as a persistent, positive, cognitive-affective experience in sport that is characterized by vigour, dedication, and confidence. Based on the predictions of Vallerand&#65533;s (1997; Vallerand &amp; Losier, 1999) motivational model, it was hypothesized that elite New Zealand athletes with higher perceptions of competence, autonomy, and relatedness (i.e., basic psychological needs) would also report more self-determined motives to participate in sport and that individuals with higher self-determined motivation would experience lower athlete burnout and higher athlete engagement. Before testing these hypotheses four preliminary studies were necessary. First, because of the nomadic lifestyles of many elite athletes, it was decided that an online survey delivered via the Internet would be the most appropriate and effective method for collecting data to test the central hypotheses. However, a literature search revealed that no studies in sport psychology had compared online and traditional paper and pencil survey methods and therefore a preliminary study was needed to investigate potential survey format effects. Results of measurement invariance and latent mean structures analyses indicated that there were no differences on the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire for randomly assigned online (n=117) and paper and pencil (n=97) groups. Second, recent research (e.g., Martens &amp; Webber, 2002; Riemer, Fink, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2002) has indicated that the only published measure of behavioural regulations (i.e., motives) in sport (Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, &amp; Blais, 1995) has psychometric problems. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a reliable and valid measure of behavioural regulations in sport. Following rigorous scale development procedures that included expert review and pilot testing, results from two studies (n=382 and n=343) supported the reliability and validity of this new measure - the Behavioural Regulations in Sport Questionnaire. 
 Third, while researchers in organizational and educational psychology have examined engagement experiences, no research has investigated athlete engagement. Results of a qualitative inquiry with elite New Zealand athletes (n=15) indicated that vigour, dedication, and confidence were core athlete engagement dimensions. Fourth, items for a quantitative athlete engagement questionnaire were created using operational definitions from the qualitative study and then reviewed by athlete burnout and positive psychology experts. Analysis of data from two samples (n=382 and n=343) supported the reliability and validity of the Athlete Engagement Questionnaire. Results from the final study (n=343) investigating the relationships amongst basic needs, behavioural regulations, burnout, and engagement generally supported the main hypotheses of the thesis. Indeed, athletes with higher perceptions of autonomy and competence reported more self-determined regulations; however, relatedness was not a significant predictor. Athletes&#65533; levels of self-determined motivation accounted for substantial portions of variance in athlete burnout symptoms: emotional/physical exhaustion (R&#65533;=.13), sport devaluation (R&#65533;=.43) and reduced accomplishment (R&#65533;=.42). Behavioural regulations were also strong predictors of athlete engagement, accounting for 49% of the variance in vigour, 42% of the variance in dedication, and 30% of the variance in confidence. Implications of these results for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Directions for research concerning SDT, athlete burnout, and athlete engagement are also highlighted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burn out (psychology)</field><field name="subject">motivation (psychology)</field><field name="subject">autonomy (psychology)</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">athletics</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070220.144258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Excited state structures of polypyridyl complexes : a spectroscopic and DFT study</field><field name="creator">Howell, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the spectroscopic and computational studies of a number of Cu(I), Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes of polypyridyl ligands. The ligands considered in this study were 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, dibenzo[b,j][1,10]phenanthroline, dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]phenazine, dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]-6,7-dichlorophenazine and dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]-6,7-dimethylphenazine. 
 Density functional theory calculations were carried out on the polypyridyl ligands. Validation of the calculations was carried out by comparison of the predicted values to observables. The structures were compared to previously published X-ray crystal data. Calculated bond lengths were typically calculated to be within 0.02 A&#778; of those in the crystal structure. The calculated vibrational spectra were compared to measured IR and Raman spectra. The correspondence between calculated and measured frequencies was quantified using the mean absolute deviation between the two sets of frequencies. This was typically found to be less than 10 cm&#8315;&#65533;. The robustness of the calculation was further tested by calculations on perdeuterated analogues of some of the ligands. The calculations were extended to metal moieties and validated as for the ligands. 
 Resonance Raman and infrared spectra of the reduced states of some Re(I) complexes are reported. The structure and spectra have been modelled by considering the radical anion of the polypyridyl ligand and the reduced state of the complex. There is improvement in the mean absolute deviation, between calculated and observed frequencies, upon incorporation of the metal moiety into the calculation. Spectra are successfully modelled confirming the validity of the modelled structures. 
 The resonance Raman and infrared spectra of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited states of some Cu(I), Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes are reported. Density functional theory calculations on the lowest energy triplet states aided in the spectral assignment of bands. Cu(I) complexes were successfully modelled with mean absolute deviations, between calculated and observed frequencies, of less than 10 cm&#8315;&#65533;. The spectra of the Re(I) and Ru(II) complexes were less successfully modelled. Incorporation of the Ru(II) centre into the calculation of the vibrational frequencies of dipyrido[2,3-a:3&#65533;,2&#65533;-c]phenazine complexes offers no improvement over modelling the radical anion of this polypyridyl ligand. 
 The excited state lifetimes of a number of polypyridyl complexes have been reported. The changes in lifetimes of similar complexes were found to be consistent with the energy gap law or changes in the conjugation of the involved polypyridyl ligand. 
 This project has allowed the excited state structures of a number of polypyridyl complexes to be determined using vibrational spectroscopy to validate density functional theory calculations. This has provided a study strategy that may be applied to other metal polypyridyl complexes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complex compounds</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="subject">raman spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.155843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stepping stones to others&#65533; minds : the relation between maternal mental and non-mental state input and social understanding in 15-,24, and 33 month-old children</field><field name="creator">Taumoepeau, Mele Ma'ata</field><field name="description">Recent research has shown that children under two years demonstrate some early social understanding. Previous research has also demonstrated that mother talk about mental states is a factor in older preschoolers&#65533; later theory of mind understanding. In order to learn more about the predictive nature of mother mental state talk to very young children, this study examined the relation between mother talk about mental states at 15 and 24 months and their later mental state language and emotion understanding at 24 and 33 months. 
 At all three time points, 71 mothers and 3 fathers (N=74) described pictures to their infants and mother talk was coded for mental and non-mental state language at 15, 24 and 33 months. In addition, at all three time points, children&#65533;s mental and non-mental state vocabulary levels were obtained via parental report. At the second and third time points the children were administered an emotion situation and a body emotion task. The mothers&#65533; ability to interpret emotion faces was also assessed. 
 The results showed that mother use of desire language was more prevalent at 15 months, with references to thinking and knowledge increasing at 24 months. 
 Partial correlations demonstrated that mother use of desire language with 15-month old children uniquely predicted a child&#65533;s mental state language and emotion situation task performance at 24 months, even after accounting for earlier child language, mother socioeconomic status, mothers&#65533; own emotion understanding, and other types of mother non-mental state language. Similarly, at 24 months of age, after accounting for potentially confounding variables, such as child language, mother use of think/know language as well as desire language were both predictors of children&#65533;s mental state language and emotion task performance at 33 months. 
 The results further demonstrated that mothers&#65533; tendency to refer to the child&#65533;s (versus others&#65533;) desires at 15 months was the more consistent correlate of children&#65533;s mental state language and emotion understanding at 24 months. At 24 months a different pattern emerged with both references to the child&#65533;s and others&#65533; thoughts and knowledge correlating with child mental state language and emotion task performance at 33 months. 
 It is proposed that Vygotsky&#65533;s zone of proximal development provides a framework within which maternal talk about specific mental states scaffolds the development of children&#65533;s later social understanding. I also suggest that such scaffolding motivates mothers to talk more about the child&#65533;s mental states when they are younger, before introducing talk that focuses on others&#65533; mental states.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social perception in children</field><field name="subject">social interaction in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070322.121926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biomarker survey of the fatty acid status of New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Francesca Lee</field><field name="description">My thesis research has examined the fatty acid composition of serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester in 2793 participants who took part in the 1997 National Nutrition Survey - a national population-based survey of New Zealand adolescents and adults aged or [greater than or equal to]&#818;15 y. Differences in serum fatty acids by sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index and smoking - independent of dietary fat intake - were determined. Serum fatty acids were used as biomarkers of saturated and polyunsaturated fat intake to predict population serum total cholesterol concentrations. The association between n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum phospholipid and mental and physical wellbeing, as assessed by the short form-36, was determined. 
 Serum fatty acids have been used as biological markers of fat intake and to predict the risk of disease. The fatty acid composition of serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester is subject to alteration by dietary fat but overall, is largely controlled by metabolic enzymes. Non-dietary variables - sex, age, body mass index or cigarette smoking - may influence the activity of these enzymes, which will subsequently alter the fatty acid composition but the extent to which these affect serum fatty acid composition in the general population is poorly understood. Our results showed that the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid in serum phospholipid and cholesterol ester was significantly greater in women by 0.15 and 0.02 mol%, respectively in comparison to men whereas, the proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid was significantly greater in men by 0.08 and 0.1 mol%, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, body mass index and smoking. A number of differences in the proportion of palmitoleic acid in serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester were detected; palmitoleic acid increased across the age categories in women (15-24, 25-44, 45-64 65+ y), was higher in women compared to men, New Zealand Europeans compared to New Zealand Maori and Pacific People, those with a body mass index or [greater than or equal to] 30 kg/m&#65533; compared to those with a body mass index &lt; 25 kg/m&#65533; and in current smokers in comparison to non-smokers. In women, there was an inverse trend in the proportion of linoleic acid in serum phospholipid and cholesterol ester across the age categories. The proportion of linoleic acid in serum triacylglycerol, phospholipid and cholesterol ester was lower in smokers by 2.19, 1.04 and 0.75 mol%, respectively in comparison to non-smokers. None of these differences could be explained by a difference in dietary fat intake. Consequently, sex appears to affect the metabolism of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids independent of dietary fat intake and metabolic differences associated with age, body mass index and smoking may be at play for a number of other serum fatty acids notably, palmitoleic and linoleic acids. 
 Evidence for a role of dietary fat as a predictor of serum cholesterol concentrations in the general population is conflicting. On one hand, results from cholesterol-lowering dietary intervention trials show unequivocally that decreasing saturated fat intake produces a meaningful reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations. On the other hand, the results of large observational studies show little association between saturated fat intake and cholesterol concentrations. The lack of association in the latter studies may result from errors in dietary assessment and therefore, using serum fatty acids as biomarkers of fat intake may overcome the limitations associated with typical dietary assessment techniques. Participants were divided into quintiles of increasing proportion of serum fatty acids. Each one SD increase in the myristic acid composition of serum cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol and phospholipid was associated with an increase in cholesterol of 0.19, 0.10 and 0.13 mmol/L, respectively after adjusting for confounding variables. The difference in cholesterol concentrations between those categorised into the highest and lowest quintiles of serum cholesterol ester myristate was 0.48 mmol/L. A one SD increase in the linoleic acid composition of serum cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol and phospholipid corresponded to a decrease in cholesterol of 0.07, 0.05 and 0.07 mmol/L, respectively. The difference in cholesterol concentrations between the 1st and 5th quintiles of serum cholesterol linoleate was 0.18 mmol/L. Intake of saturated and polyunsaturated fats, as measured using serum fatty acids, are important determinants of cholesterol concentrations in New Zealanders. 
 It has been hypothesised that a lower intake of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, largely of marine origin, is implicated in the aetiology of depressive disorder. Results from the majority of observational studies have shown that depressed participants have a lower proportion of eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acid in phospholipids compared to controls but evidence for an improvement in depressive symptoms after supplementation with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is conflicting. There is little known about the role that n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may have as predictors of mental wellbeing in the general population. Participants were categorised into quintiles of increasing n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in serum phospholipid. There was no significant trend in self-reported mental wellbeing - the mental component score - across the quintiles of eicosapentaenoic, docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids or the sum of these three fatty acids after adjusting for confounding variables. There was a significant trend in the mental component score across the quintiles of the ratio of eicosapentaenoic/arachidonic acid; the difference between the highest and the lowest quintile was 6.6 points. There were significant positive trends in self-reported physical health - the physical component score - across the quintiles of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids as well as the ratio of eicosapentaenoic/arachidonic acid ratio; the difference between the 1st and 5th quintiles were 8.6, 6.0 and 8.9 points, respectively. Overall, there appears to be little association between the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of serum phospholipid and self-reported mental health in a population of low fish consumers; however, the proportion of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may be an important predictor of physical wellbeing in New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biochemical markers</field><field name="subject">lipids in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">fatty acids in human nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070328.162638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of the cytokines IFN&#947;, IL-12 and IL-23 to modulate immune responses raised by the gene gun method of DNA vaccination</field><field name="creator">Williman, Jonathan A.</field><field name="description">Since its discovery 15 years ago there has been an explosion of research in the field of DNA immunisation. Unfortunately despite early promises that DNA immunisation had the potential to cure almost any infectious disease, autoimmune disease or even cancer, progress towards clinical trials has been slow. This has been due in part to the huge range of permutations possible in delivering the DNA. One approach is to deliver the DNA by gene gun. Gene gun delivery is a very efficient way of transfecting cells however also has a number of possible disadvantages. These drawbacks include a weak immunogenicity in larger animals as well as the tendency to bias towards the development of a strong type 2 response. 
 In an effort to enhance antigen-specific immune responses and counter the type 2 polarisation of gene gun delivery, a series of DNA vaccines were created where the extracellular portion of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from influenza A/PR8/34 virus was genetically fused the type 1 cytokines IFN&#947;, IL-12 and IL-23. Interleukin-23 has been recently discovered and even though both IL-12 and IL-23 contain the p40 subunit they seem to have dissimilar functions. 
 The vaccine constructs were first tested in cellular assays in vitro to ensure correct production and biological activity of the attached cytokines. They were then delivered in various combinations to groups of BALB/c mice to test development of immune responses and the effect of different delivery regimes. Finally mice were immunised then challenged with live influenza virus to determine the different DNA vaccines&#65533; protective efficacy. 
 DNA vaccines containing the HA gene alone (pHA) or fused to IFN&#947; (pIFN&#947;HA), IL-12 (pIL-12HA) or IL-23 (pIL-23HA) were successfully constructed. The fusion of the HA gene to the genes for IFN&#947;, IL-12 or IL-23 did not significantly disturb the structure of the antigen or prevent the biological actions of the cytokines. Mice immunised three times with pHA had high titres of serum IgG1 antibody and their splenocytes produced approximately equal amounts of IFN&#947; and IL-5. Co-delivery of IFN&#947; was unable to alter immune responses regardless of whether it was delivered at the first, last or during all immunisations. Surprisingly co-delivery of IL-12 acted to suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses, possibly through an IFN&#947;/nitric oxide feedback loop. On the other hand co-delivery of IL-23 tended to enhanced immune responses and, while it did not significantly alter the type 1 to type 2 balance, it was able to increase the ability of mice to clear live influenza virus from their lungs when they were challenged 26 weeks after immunisation. This protection was associated with increased levels of neutralising antibody in the serum of pIL-23HA immunised mice. 
 This research has illuminated several of the pitfalls in the development of DNA vaccines and the use of cytokine as adjuvants. However it has also broadened our understanding of IL-23 and implies that IL-23 could be effectively used to increase the development of longterm immunity after immunisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">DNA vaccines</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">cytokines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.151123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural controls on gold - quartz vein mineralisation in the Otago schist, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scott, John G.</field><field name="description">Hydrothermal fluid flow is spatially and genetically associated with deformation in the earth&#65533;s crust. In the Otago Schist, New Zealand, the circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the Cretaceous formed numerous mesothermal gold-quartz vein deposits. Otago schist rocks are largely L-S tectonites in which the penetrative fabric is the product of more than one deformation phase/transposition cycle. Regional correlation of deformation events allowed mineralised deposits to be related to the structural evolution of the Otago Schist. Compilation of a detailed tectonostratigraphy of New Zealand basement rocks reveals that extensional mineralisation correlates with the onset of localised terrestrial fanglomerate deposition, thermal perturbation and granitic intrusion that mark the beginning of New Zealand rifting from the Antarctic portion of Gondwana. 
 Laminated and breccia textures in mineralised veins suggest that host structures have experienced repeated episodes of incremental slip and hydrothermal fluid flow. However, analysis of vein orientation data in terms of fault reactivation theory (Amontons Law) shows that most deposits contain veins that are unfavourably oriented for frictional reactivation. Repeated movement on unfavourably oriented structures may involve dynamic processes of strain refraction due to competency contrasts, the effect of anisotropy in the schist, or localised stress field rotation. 
 Deposits have been classified on the basis of host structure kinematics at the time of mineralisation into low angle thrust faults, and high angle extensional fault - fracture arrays. Low angle deposits have a mapped internal geometry that is very different from conventional imbricate thrust systems.

The disease is usually asymptomatic, often being diagnosed incidentally. Once diagnosed, elective repair of an AAA results in excellent long-term survival with a 3-5% operative mortality. However, up to one half of patients present with ruptured aneurysms, a complication that carries an 80% mortality in the community, and of those reaching hospital, a 50% mortality. Clearly early diagnosis and treatment results in improved survival. 
 Screening for AAA, with ultrasound, would detect aneurysms early, prior to rupture. However, debate continues over the cost effectiveness of population based screening programmes. The identification of a sub-population at a higher risk of developing AAA would increase the yield of a screening prograrmne. A number of populations have been examined, none of which have received international acceptance. 
 About 20% of patients with an AAA have a family history of an aneurysm. The disease is also considered to be a disease of Caucasians, both facts suggesting a strong genetic component to the disease. Perhaps a genetically identified sub-population at a high risk of developing an AAA would prove to be an ideal population for screening. 
 This thesis examines the incidence of aneurysms and the family histories of patients with AAA in the Otago region of New Zealand. Almost twenty percent of the population has a family history of AAA. DNA was collected from each of these patients for genetic analysis. The population was divided into familial AAA and non-familial AAA for the purpose of genetic analysis and compared to a control population. 
 AAA is believed to be a disease of Caucasians; a non-Caucasian population with a low incidence of AAA may prove to be a good control population for genetic studies. A literature review demonstrated a higher incidence of AAA in Caucasians than other ethnic groups and within Caucasians a higher incidence in patients of Northern European origin. The incidence was low in Asian communities, even in studies involving of migrant Asian populations. The New Zealand Maori are believed to have originated from South East Asia, therefore could be expected to have a low incidence of AAA and would make an ideal control population for genetic studies. A pilot study was undertaken to examine the incidence of AAA in the New Zealand Maori. The age standardised incidence of AAA proved to be at least equal in Maori to non-Maori, with a more aggressive form of the disease in Maori, manifesting with a younger age at presentation and a higher incidence of ruptured aneurysms at diagnosis. 
 It is well known that at the time of surgery, an AAA is at the end stage in its life. At this time, inflammation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzymes are prevalent within the aneurysm wall and have destroyed the wall of the aorta. One of the most important genetic pathways regulating these enzymes is the plasminogen activator inhibiter 1-Tissue plasminogen activator-plasmin pathway. 
 Genetic analysis of this pathway demonstrated an association of the 4G5G polymorphism in the promoter of the PAl-1 gene with familial AAA. In this insertion:deletion polymorphism, the 5G variant binds an activator and repressor, resulting in reduced PAI-1 expression and ultimately increased MMP activation. This allele was associated with familial aneurysms, 47% versus 62% non-familial AAA and 61% controls (p=0.024). 
 A polymorphism within the tissue plasminogen activator gene was also examined and no association was found with AAA. 
 Another way the MMPs expression could be increased is from mutations or polymorphisms in their own genetic structure. Stromelysin 3 is itself a MMP capable of destroying the aortic wall and it has a role in activating other MMPs. A 5A6A insertion:deletion polymorphism exists in the promoter of this gene. The 5A allele variant results in increased stromelysin expression and is associated with AAA 46% versus 33% in controls p=0. 0006. 
 The actions of the MMPs are themselves inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases. The TIMP genes have been sequenced; two polymorphisms have been identified in the non-coding promoter area of the TIMP 1 gene. Further studies are necessary to examine the effect of these polymorphisms. 
 Inflammation has been implicated in aneurysm progression. One of the roles of the inflammatory cells found in an aneurysm is to deliver the MMP&#65533;s to the AAA. The HLA system is integral in controlling this inflammation and was therefore examined. 
 From this series of studies it is concluded that there is a genetic component to AAA. This thesis presents the first genetic polymorphism associated with familial AAA and explores the role of a genetic pathway in the formation of AAA.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">aortic aneurysms</field><field name="subject">abdominal aneurysm</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.143818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nga reo o nga niupepa : Maori language newspapers 1855-1863</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Lachlan</field><field name="description">By 1855, most Maori still lived in a tribal setting, with little official Pakeha interference. This would have been as they expected, exercising their tino rangatiratanga, the chiefly rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi. However, their world was changing. In an effort to gain Pakeha goods, many Maori had entered the market economy. Most had converted to Christianity. Many could read and write. Some had sold land to accommodate the increasing numbers of Pakeha settlers. These trends gratified the government. It envisaged a New Zealand society dominated by Pakeha, in which European mores would be norm, and where its sovereignty, gained through the Treaty, would be substantive rather than nominal. 
 At this time, the government pursued the policy of iwi kotahi (one people) or "amalgamation". This policy included the aim of elevating Maori socially and economically by extending to them the benefits of European civilisation. It sought too to encourage Maori to give up their "waste" lands for Pakeha settlement and for Maori to accept the rule of English law, and government authority. Ultimately the two races would become one society- a Pakeha-style society. The government used newspapers for disseminating its message to Maori, publishing the bi-lingual Maori Messenger-Te Karere Maori from January 1855 to September 1863. 
 This thesis investigates the government&#65533;s newspaper, plus other Maori language newspapers appearing within the period, printed by government agents, evangelical Pakeha, the Wesleyan Church, and the rival Maori government, the Kingitanga. The thesis not only looks at the impact of newspapers upon Maori society and politics at this time, but also how the newspapers portrayed the major social and political issues to Maori, including the first Taranaki War, the Kohimarama Conference, and the impending all-out war with the Kingitanga in Waikato. 
 Using the newspapers as its major source, this thesis seeks to show how Maori might have understood the issues, and where possible, to allow them to respond in their own voices. We are fortunate that for almost a year the Kingitanga was able to publish its own views in Te Hokioi, thus allowing the anti-government Maori voice to articulate its stand. However, Maori opinion was hardly unitary. The Pakeha-run Maori language newspapers, through reports, reported speeches, and their corresponence columns, provide another set of Maori opinions, which show a variety of opinions on political and social issues. Many histories of this period focus on the tensions and conflicts between Crown and Maori, thus marginalising pro-government Maori, the waverers, and those who merely wanted to keep trouble from their door. This thesis endeavours to illuminate the whole colonial discourse as it appeared in the Maori language newspapers, providing as wide a range of opinions as possible.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">newspapers</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">te reo Maori</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.151028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theoretical and practical dimensions of pounamu management</field><field name="creator">Hope-Pearson, E.W.</field><field name="description">The vesting of pounamu back to Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu brings to the fore a whole new dimension of resource mangement to New Zealand&#65533;s wider resource management environment. As is highlighted in this study and noted by a number of academics, Maori people, like other indigenous communities, have their own planning systems values and appropriate processes for decision-making about the environment. But the relevance of such indigenous management systems has long been overlooked by the decision makers and authorities to the continued frustration and anxiety of indigenous peoples. This lack of recognition has been at the fore as a concept fundamental to many indigenous peoples grievances, both past and present. The subsequent vesting of pounamu has brought about the validation that Maori have to resource management rights.
	In identifying issues associated with the management of natural resources by indigenous peoples, this study provides an examination of number theoretical concepts and a practical dimension associated with the management of natural resources by indigenous peoples and has placed pounamu in context. The placement of pounamu in context has provided the basis from which a number of central issues were identified and discussed.
	A combination a literature study, analysis of an application traditional knowledge in a contemporary context and in-depth interviews and liaison with key stakeholders involved directly and indirectly in the management of pounmau were undertaken, has established that the management of natural resources by indigenous people is more about the management of number of associated processes rather than about the management of a single commodity, in this instance pounamu. Within these processes there exist a number of complex relationships that reflect the fundamental transaction of power and privilege associated with natural resource management. Further conclusions that this study has made, is the increasing need and importance of legislatures and planning professionals alike to further recognise the validity and become familiar with alternate methods of resource management and the application of indigenous systems and methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Pounamu</field><field name="subject">Greenstone</field><field name="subject">natural resources management</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.125737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bicultural nationhood in the bonds of capital</field><field name="creator">Begg, Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis approaches the issue of bicultural nationhood as articulated through a Maori/Pakeha binary in Aotearoa/New Zealand by interrogating the deeply entrenched social forms that inform liberal democracy and that institutionalize capitalism in the modern nation-state. More specifically, it explores the concepts of &#65533;self-governing people&#65533;, &#65533;public sphere&#65533; and &#65533;free market&#65533; as three forms of collective agency that discursively construct &#65533;society&#65533; within the social imaginary and that interact to set the terms of democratic citizenship. Central to this discussion is the indigenous/non-indigenous binary constituting biculturalism and the manifestation of &#65533;indigeneity&#65533; as both unassimilable difference in the project of modernity and as political struggle for recognition and power. This study elaborates through the mediated texts of the mediasphere and argues that there is a constant relation between nation, culture and class wherein culture-as-difference provides a framework for masking class struggle in capitalist relations of production as well as for enabling the dominant group to discursively construct their own ethnicity as national cultural identity.
	What is at stake in this discussion is the contrast between cultural difference as it emerges in the performance of everyday life and as reaction to issues of economic marginalization and cultural difference as it is contrived by the nation-state in terms of a Maori/Pakeha binary. The aim of this thesis is to highlight the necessity of difference in cultural identified, labeled and marketed as a fixed concept, but is an ephemeral by-product of ongoing social struggle for survival, recognition and political power. The objective is to undercut current ideological propositions and demand a just, equitable and democratic approach to the conceptualization of nationhood in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">political culture</field><field name="subject">democracy</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.142710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is Maori patient-centered medicine for Pakeha general practitioners?</field><field name="creator">Colquhoun, D. (David James)</field><field name="description">This research was designed to see whether the clinical method espoused by Moira Stewart et al in the book "Patient-Centered: Transforming The Clinical Method" is appropriate for Pakeha general practitioners to use in clinical consultations with Maori patients.
	This thesis uses qualitative methodology. One of my supervisors and I selected from the kuia (old women) and kaumatua (old men) of Hauraki those whom I would approach to be involved. Nearly all responded in the affirmative.
	The kuia and kaumatua talked about their tikanga, about the basis of tikanga, about the spirituality of their Maori worldview. They talked about the need to maintain their tikanga, about qualities that they respect. They described different roles within Maoridom, especially those of the kuia, whaea (mothers) and Tohunga (experts). They refer to a GP as a Tohunga because of the GP&#65533;s special expertise. The GP is able to use his or her special expertise to heal Maori patients, but needs to be able to get through barriers to do so. They are also clear that Maori and Pakeha live in two different worlds which can merge in some circumstances.
	I came to two conclusions. The first is that the elements of Patient-Centered Medicine are relevant to the consultation of a Pakeha GP and Maori patient, and provides a framework that is productive. The second conclusion is that there is a better framework for working with Maori patients, within which Patient-Centered Medicine can be practiced more effectively. Maori already have a framework (tikanga) in which they function, and if in their settings, especially the marae, he or she is welcomed and has a place in their world; tikanga accommodates the GP as a Tohunga and Maori respond to him or her as such.
	In summary, a Pakeha GP who has some knowledge of tikanga or Maori culture and who has a basic knowledge of the Maori language of tikanga of Maori culture and who has a basic knowledge of the Maori language can work very well for his or her Maori patients by working within the framework of Tikanga Maori and by being patient-centered in consultation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">family medicine</field><field name="subject">physicians</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.144541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of the savage : western intellectual responses to the Maori and Aborigine, first contact to 1850</field><field name="creator">Wybrow, Vernon</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of the West&#65533;s intellectual responses to the indigenous inhabitants of Australia and New Zealand from the period of first contact through until 1850.

The thesis does, however, discuss the formulation and expression of those intellectual traditions that informed the Western response to the Maori and Aborigine. Specifically, each chapter addresses a particular aspect of the West&#65533;s interaction with the indigenous peoples of Australasia in order demonstrate how the Western narratives of exploration, travel and settlement were informed by the wider discourse of colonialism. Amongst some of the themes addressed in the course of this thesis are: the ideal of the &#65533;Good Savage&#65533;, the shifting notion of a &#65533;Great Chain of Being&#65533;, the rise of natural history as a system for classifying human difference and the importance of ideas of savagery in framing the colonial response to the Maori and Aborigine were characterised by similarities and continuities as much as by the more commonly acknowledged differences and discontinuities.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.150402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political economy of Maori protest politics, 1968-1995 : a Marxist analysis of the roots of Maori oppression and the politics of resistance</field><field name="creator">Poata-Smith, E.S Te Ahu</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a Marxist analysis of the political economy of contemporary Maori protest politics in the years from 1968 to 1995. It is argued that Maori protest politics embraces a range of competing political ideologies, which are informed by different assumptions about the causes of Maori inequality in wider society, and in turn, different sets of strategies for ameliorating and transcending that inequality.
	Overall, the thesis has two central concerns: firstly, it identifies the critical economic, political and ideological conditions and context that have allowed particular competing political ideologies and strategies to dominate contemporary Maori protest politics. This involves a particular focus on understanding and explaining the rise of identity politics and cultural nationalism as the dominant political strategy within Maori protest politics. This involves a particular focus on understanding and explaining the rise of identity politics and cultural nationalism as the dominant political strategy within Maori protest politics. Secondly, the thesis critically assesses the effectiveness of contemporary Maori struggles against racism and oppression on the basis of whether they involve, or are likely to contribute towards, the transformation of the generative structures that give rise to manifest inequalities between Maori and non-Maori. It is argued that the systematic alienation of land and the inequality that exists between Maori and non-Maori are not simply the result of the underlying cultural values of individual non-Maori but are rather the result of the historical process of capitalist development in Aotearoa and the economic, political and ideological requirements necessary for the generalised commodification of indigenous labour-power.
	The thesis explores how the politics and practice of Maori protest has been shaped and influenced to a large extent by the underlying social, economic, political and ideological forces of global capitalism. It is argued that the international collapse of the long boom, the global upturn in class struggle and the emergence of the New Left internationally from the late 1960s had an enormous influence on the political direction of Maori protest in the New Zealand context. The success of the working class offensive and the growing political influence of rank and file Maori workers ensured that Maori protest groups formed part of the progressive social movements of the time. Indeed, although some were explicitly nationalist in their orientation, these movements were consciously part of the Left.
	The balance of political forces within the Maori protest movement changed considerably during the late 1970s and early 1980s with the rise of the New Right as a political force internationally together with the rise of employer militancy, the defeat and demoralization of the working class movement internationally, the decline of the social movements and the absence of mass struggle. This had important implications for the influence of the various ideological factions that co-existed uneasily in the Maori political milieu from the early 1970s onwards. The downturn in militant mass struggle saw the rise in the influence of identity politics as cultural nationalist strategies came to dominate Maori protest politics, representing a fundamental retreat from Left-wing ideas. In practice this entailed a rejection of the class politics and mass struggle that had informed the politics and strategies of Maori protest groups from the late 1960s, and its replacement with a politics of cross-class alliances and a personal rejection of &#65533;Pakeha society&#65533;. In practice this was a recipe for passivity and divisiveness within the Maori protest movement itself.
	The politics of cultural nationalism left Maori ill-equipped to resist the ruling class counter-offensive and the anti-working class policies that successive governments introduced to restore the conditions for profitable capital accumulation. In particular, the rejection of a class analysis of Maori inequality in capitalist society has undermined the capacity of working class Maori to resist the neo-liberal agenda and a Treaty of Waitangi settlement process that has resulted in a substantial shift in resources to those sections of Maori society already wealthy and powerful. Although the settlement process represented an important concession by the state, it has never compensated for the anti-working class policies of governments since 1984, which have widened the social and economic inequalities in New Zealand society. In this way, the emphasis on cultural identity alone as the determining factor in Maori oppression has been counter-productive for working class Maori as successive governments shifted the costs of the economic crisis on to the weakest sections of the community.
	As New Zealand entered a new period of economic and social crisis in the 1990s, the commercial interests of Maori tribal executives, Maori corporate enterprises, and the Maori bureaucracy were clearly at odds with the material interests of the vast majority of working class Maori families. This fundamental conflict in class interests was to set the scene for a revival of militancy on scale not seen since the 1970s.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">tino rangatiratanga</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="subject">social classes</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.153703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of mouse UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression</field><field name="creator">Kim, Dongho</field><field name="description">Uncoupling protein, UCP, present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to adaptive thermogenesis. UCP functions as a proton pore and can dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient established by the respiratory chain during fuel oxidation, and thus generates heat without producing ATP. However, the brown adipose tissue thermogenesis is not likely to be a major mechanism in controlling energy expenditure for humans because adults have only residual amounts of the tissue. 
 Two new members of the UCP family have been identified based on their high sequence homology to UCP in BAT and named UCP2 and UCP3. The original UCP was renamed UCP1. At the amino acid level, human UCP2 and UCP3 are 59% and 57% identical to UCP1, respectively. In contrast to UCP1, UCP2 is expressed in many tissues such as brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, muscle, spleen and macrophages. UCP3 is expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle in humans, and brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in rodents. Since their identification many functional studies, including transgenic animals and ectopic expression of UCP2 or UCP3 in yeast, showed uncoupling activity of UCP2 and UCP3. A number of studies have been done that show increased expression of UCP2 and UCP3 by fasting, high-fat diets and suckling of newborn mice. A common characteristic of these circumstances is an associated increase in plasma free fatty acid levels. This study aimed to investigate effects of fatty acids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and other transcription factors on UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression and to explore the molecular mechanism of their regulation through analysis of the promoter of the UCP2 and UCP3 genes. 
 The 3.1 kb and 3.2 kb 5&#65533;-flanking regions of the mouse UCP2 and UCP3 genes, respectively, were cloned and used to construct promoter reporter gene (firefly luciferase) plasmids. The cloned region of the UCP2 and UCP3 genes contained putative binding motifs for several transcription factors, including PPAR, myogenin, and MyoD. Luciferase assays of both constructs showed basal promoter activity with 20~190-fold induction for the UCP2 promoter and 1.3~23-fold induction for the UCP3 promoter in several transfected cell lines, including 3T3-L1, C2C12, L6, COS7 and HepG2. Oleic acid (0.3 mM) up-regulated endogenous UCP2 mRNA by 2.3-fold in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but not in C2C12 myotubes, and UCP3 mRNA by 2.5-fold in C2C12 myotubes. Responsiveness of the cloned promoter to oleic acid reflected the tissue-specific responsiveness of their endogenous genes but with less fold induction, 1.4-fold for UCP2 promoter in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and 1.5-fold for UCP3 promoter in C2C12 myotubes. 
 Forced expression of PPAR isotypes (PPAR&#945;, PPAR[delta] and PPAR&#947;) showed tissue and isotype-specific activation of the UCP2 promoter. UCP2 promoter activity was induced by 2-fold by PPAR&#947; in 3T3-L1 and by 2.8-fold by PPAR[delta] in C2C12. Treatment of oleic acid (0.3 mM) brought about further induction of the UCP2 promoter activity only in 3T3-L1. In contrast, all three isotypes induced activation of the UCP3 promoter in 3T3-L1, C2C12 and HepG2 cells. Treatment with oleic acid (0.3 mM) or isotype-specific agonist (10 [mu]M) resulted in further increased activity of the UCP3 promoter in 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells. In particular, rosiglitazone (10 [mu]M) induced a 41-fold increase in UCP3 promoter activity in PPAR&#947; transfected HepG2 cells, and this induction returned to basal level by treatment with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) (50 [mu]M), an antagonist for PPAR&#947;. 
 In addition, UCP3 promoter activity increased up to 20-fold 4 days after induction of C2C12 myoblasts differentiation, whereas UCP2 promoter activity increased only up to 2-fold. Forced expression of myogenin and MyoD in C2C12 myoblasts to mimic differentiation, induced UCP3 promoter activity in an additive manner, consistent with UCP3 being regulated by muscle differentiation. 
 In the present study, it has been shown that UCP2 and UCP3 genes are regulated differently by fatty acids. The tissue-type dependence in regulation of endogenous UCP2 and UCP3 paralleled the cell type-specific effect of oleic acid on the promoter-reporter constructs, suggesting that fatty acid effects are at the transcriptional level. UCP2 and UCP3 promoters showed differences in their response to PPARs. Mediation of the fatty acid effect through PPARs has been also demonstrated, but direct binding of PPARs and particular regulatory motifs on the cloned promoter region have not yet been investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">brown adipose tissue</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.131549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrated complexes in the earth&#65533;s atmosphere</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Daniel Paul</field><field name="description">The interaction between sunlight and our atmosphere is one of the most fundamental processes affecting weather and climate. The majority of the Sun&#65533;s radiation is produced in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These spectral regions correspond to the energies of vibrational overtone and electronic transitions. The composition of our atmosphere is complex, and many trace species have a large influence on its chemistry and dynamics. Hydrogen bound hydrated complexes are trace species that could play an important role in the Earth&#65533;s atmosphere. However, before this role can be quantified, spectral identification and characterisation of these complexes is essential. 
 We have developed vibrational local mode Hamiltonians to simulate the absorption spectra of hydrated complexes. To test the approximations made in the vibrational model, we have peformed calculations on the diatomics OH, HF and CO, which can be considered to act as pure local modes. When highly correlated ab initio methods and large basis sets are used to calculate the potential energy and dipole moment curve, the simulated vibrational transitions of the diatomics are in excellent agreement with experiment. 
 We have derived approximate vibrational Hamiltonians which describe the OH-stretching and HOH-bending modes of vibration in the complexes H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O, H&#8322;O&#65533;HO&#8322; and H&#8322;O&#65533;HO. The calculated spectrum of H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O has been used to assess its atmospheric importance, and to succesfully guide experimental efforts to detect H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O in the laboratory and the Earth&#65533;s atmosphere. The calculated transition energies and intensities of H&#8322;O&#65533;H&#8322;O and H&#8322;O&#65533;HO are in good agreement with experimental matrix isolation and gas-phase studies. 
 To investigate the effect of low frequency modes on OH-stretching overtone spectra we have simulated the spectrum of HOONO. We have derived a Hamiltonian that couples the NOOH-torsional mode to the high frequency OH-stretching and OOH-bending modes. The simulated spectrum is in good agreement with the experimentally observed spectrum. We find that the OH-stretching spectra are perturbed strongly only if the barrier to torsion is low. 
 We have also investigated changes in the electronic spectrum of hydrated complexes and the corresponding parent monomers. Upon complex formation, the lowest-lying electronic transition in the hydroxyl radical is strongly redshifted outside the region of monomeric absorption.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrates</field><field name="subject">complex compounds</field><field name="subject">atmospheric chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.120933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct selection by colour for visual encoding</field><field name="creator">Vierck, Esther</field><field name="description">The goal of this thesis was to investigate the role of colour in visual selective attention. Previous experiments exploring this topic in tasks where location varied led to mixed results. Some studies only found evidence of colour as a guide to a specific location where selection then takes place (e.g., Nissen, 1985). Others reported an effect, but could not decide clearly if the benefit was due to direct selection of colour in perception (e.g., Humphreys, 1981). One major contributor to the inconsistencies of findings seems to be the confounding of colour and location in these tasks. For that reason the initial paradigm used here was a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Previous studies using similar paradigms have found no evidence for direct selection by colour (Poder, 2001; Shih &amp; Sperling, 1996), but in these studies advance colour information was of limited usefulness because it only reduced the set of candidate stimuli by half. To assess an effect of colour in selection similar to the one associated with location, in all experiments reported here valid colour information led to only one item, as is typical in location cuing tasks. 
 The first RSVP experiment explored whether colour certainty improved performance over a colour uncertainty condition. Colour was the defining feature of the target participants had to discriminate. In one condition the target colour was certain; in the other it could be one of two colours. Performance was improved when participants could focus on one colour. Further experiments used colour not as a defining feature of the target but as additional information presented in the form of cues, similar to the typical use of location cues. The participants&#65533; task was to discriminate whether a target letter within the RSVP sequence appeared in its upper or lower case version, and an advance cue indicated the colour in which the target letter was most likely to occur. An accuracy benefit of valid colour information was found, supporting the hypothesis that colour cuing allows the direct selection of objects for further perceptual processing. In addition, an effect of invalid colour cues was also observed. Subsequent experiments investigated possible factors influencing the colour cuing effect. Together, task requirements and properties of the stimulus set were shown to have an influence on the effect size, whereas an increase in perceptual load had no impact. Furthermore, the colour cuing effect seems to be due partially to both automatic and strategic processes. In all these experimental variations, benefits of colour cuing remained, indicating that the effect is very robust. Colour cuing effects were also found in a design where location could vary, extending the previous findings from selection in the time domain to selection in space. The two last experiments investigated whether advance colour knowledge would also lead to a performance benefit in single item tasks. No effect of colour cuing was found, indicating that colour information is only helpful in multiple item displays when a selection of one target stimulus among distractor items is necessary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">visual perception</field><field name="subject">visual pathways</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.145655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Phn and Pst systems of Mycobacterium smegmatis : phosphate transport and gene regulation</field><field name="creator">Gebhard, Susanne</field><field name="description">Phosphate is an essential but often growth-limiting nutrient for bacteria. At low concentrations of phosphate in the growth medium, bacteria induce high-affinity uptake systems for phosphate, and this is usually the ABC-type phosphate specific transport system Pst. In the fully sequenced genomes of pathogenic species of mycobacteria, several copies of the genes encoding for the Pst system (pstSCAB) have been identified and some of these genes have been shown to be virulence factors. The reasons for the presence of multiple copies of pst genes in pathogenic mycobacteria are not understood, and phosphate transport by these bacteria, as well as the gene regulation involved, is poorly characterised. The fast-growing M. smegmatis contains only a single copy of the pst operon, but we recently identified a gene locus containing three genes, phnDCE, which encode for a putative ABC-type phosphate/phosphonate transport system, and a gene, phnF, which encodes for a putative transcriptional regulator of the HutC subfamily of GntR like regulators. 
 To identify a function for the PhnDCE transport system and to characterise high-affinity phosphate transport in M. smegmatis, we created allelic exchange mutants in phnD and pstS, as well as a phnD pstS double deletion mutant. All three mutants failed to grow in minimal medium containing 10 mM phosphate, while the wildtype was able to grow in the presence of micromolar phosphate concentrations. No differences were observed in complex growth medium. Steady-state levels of [&#65533;&#65533;P]-phosphate uptake were approximately 25% lower in all mutant strains as compared to the wildtype. Kinetics of phosphate uptake in the wildtype strain when grown at low phosphate concentrations (50 [mu]M P[i]) were biphasic, suggesting the presence of two inducible transport systems with apparent K[m] values of 16 [mu]M P[i] and 64 [mu]M P[i], respectively. Analysis of the kinetics of phosphate transport in the mutant strains led us to the proposition that the Pst system has an apparent Km value of ca. 16 [mu]M P[i], and the Phn system has an apparent Km of ca. 60 [mu]M P[i]. A third inducible phosphate transport system, which was active in the double mutant strain, had an apparent K[m] of ca. 90 [mu]M P[i]. Uptake of phosphate in all strains was not inhibited by the presence of excess phosphonates or phosphite, suggesting that all three transport systems were specific for phosphate. The study of phosphate transport in the presence of various metabolic inhibitors revealed that uptake by the Phn and Pst systems is driven by ATP-hydrolysis, consistent with ABC-type transport, while the third, unidentified transport system may be driven by the proton motive force. 
 We showed that phnDCE formed an operon, and that the promoter area of the operon lies within 200 bp of the start of phnD. To investigate the regulation of the phn and pst genes, &#946;-galacosidase activities of strains carrying transcriptional lacZ-fusions of the pstSCAB, phnDCE and phnF promoter areas, and levels of mRNA of the phn and pst genes were studied. All genes were induced when phosphate concentrations fell below a threshold value of 30 [mu]M, which coincided with a shift in the growth characteristics of M. smegmatis. Expression of the pst operon appeared to be controlled directly by the PhoPR two-component regulatory system, while the phn operon may be under direct or indirect control by PhoPR. 
 To identify a role for PhnF in the regulation of phn gene expression, we created a phnF deletion mutant. PhnF appeared to repress transcription of phnDCE and phnF under phosphate-replete conditions. We identified two putative binding sequences for PhnF in the intergenic region between phnD and phnF with the sequence TGGTATAGACCA, which is similar to the proposed recognition consensus for HutC-like transcriptional regulators. Using site-directed mutagenesis of these sequences, we demonstrated that they are required for the repression of phnDCE and phnF. To prove PhnF binding to these potential binding sites, we attempted to express the M. smegmatis PhnF protein in E. coli, but could not obtain soluble recombinant protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the phnDCE promoter fragment using cell-free crude extracts of M. smegmatis were not successful. 
 We propose that Pst and Phn both constitute high-affinity phosphate specific transport systems of M. smegmatis, and that a third inducible phosphate transport system is present in this bacterium. PhnF is required for repression of phnDCE and phnF transcription under phosphate-replete conditions, while induction of the pst operon, and possibly the phn operon, under phosphate-limited conditions involves the PhoPR system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mycobacterium smegmatis</field><field name="subject">genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">hydrogen-ion concentration</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">active biological transport</field><field name="subject">phosphates</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.112113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campylobacter jejuni : virulence, dosage, survival, and colonisation characteristics</field><field name="creator">Pope, Christopher E.</field><field name="description">In a previous study, twenty-five flaA types were detected among 200 Campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained from clinical and poultry meat sources. 
 The most common flaA type detected among poultry isolates was flaA-3 at a frequency of 23%. In contrast, flaA-3 constituted 5% of the clinical isolates. FlaA-15 was detected most frequently among clinical isolates (31%) but rarely among poultry isolates (5%). Purchasers of poultry meat were therefore commonly exposed to flaA-3 yet most of the human infections were due to flaA type 15. The prevalence of different flaA types in poultry and humans might have been due to: FlaA-15 was more virulent for humans than flaA-3 (infection more likely to result). There were more C. jejuni flaA-15 cells on poultry meat (dose effect). Better survival of flaA-15 cells when freeze/thawed or when stored at +4&#65533;C (survival in kitchen). Ecological performance of flaA-3 strains in chicken gut better than that of flaA-15 (more flaA -3 cells in gut therefore greater chance of carcass contamination)? 
 Eleven strains representing flaA types 3, 13, and 15 were tested for their ability to invade cultured human epithelial cells (HEp-2). Invasiveness was considered to reflect virulence. FlaA-15 isolates were more invasive in comparison to flaA-3 and flaA-13 isolates (p&lt;0.0001). 
 Washings from chicken portions were cultured to enumerate Campylobacter cells present on the meat. C. jejuni isolates were flaA typed and the numbers were related to FlaA type. A correlation was not detected. 
 The eleven representative strains were used to inoculate 1 cm&#65533; sections of chicken skin which were stored at -20&#65533;C or +4&#65533;C over a five day period. The samples stored at -20&#65533;C were thawed and held either overnight at 25&#65533;C, overnight at +4&#65533;C or for thirty minutes at 25&#65533;C. The numbers of viable Campylobacter cells on the sections were determined. Survival ability differed from strain to strain but was not associated with flaA type. 
 The most invasive C. jejuni strain (T1016; flaA-15) and the least invasive strain (Pstau; flaA-3) were assessed for their ability to colonise the intestinal tract of one-day-old chicks. The dynamics of colonisation, after inoculation of the birds with pure cultures or with mixtures, was monitored by real-time quantitative PCR. Strain-specific primers based on the variable region of the nucleotide base sequence of flaA genes were derived for this work. This enabled the individual strains to be enumerated in gut contents from colonized chickens. Both strains could colonise the chick intestinal tract but C. jejuni strain T1016 (flaA-15) could competitively exclude PStau (flaA-3). 
 It was concluded that the higher prevalence of flaA-15 strains among the clinical isolates was due to its higher virulence for humans. In other words, despite a low prevalence of flaA-15 on poultry meat, infection was more likely to result when C. jejuni flaA-15 cells were consumed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">poultry</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.141243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori language integration in the age of information technology: a computational approach</field><field name="creator">Laws, Mark R.</field><field name="description">A multidisciplinary approach that involves language universals, linguistic discourse analysis and computer information technology are combined to support the descriptive nature of this research dissertation. Utilising comparative methods to determine rudimentary language structures which reflect both the scientific and historic parameters that are embedded in all languages. From a hypothesis to the proof of concept, a multitude of computer applications have been used to test these language models, templates and frameworks. To encapsulate this entire approach, it is best described as "designing then building the theoretical, experimental, and practical projects that form the structural network of the Maori language system". The focus on methods for integrating the language is to investigate shared characteristics between Maori and New Zealand English. This has provided a complete methodology for a bilingual based system. A system with text and speech for language generation and classification. This approach has looked at existing computational linguistic and information processing techniques for the analysis of each language&#65533;s phenomena; where data from basic units to higher-order linguistic knowledge has been analysed in terms of their characteristics for similar and/or dissimilar features. The notion that some language units can have similar acoustic sounds, structures or even meanings in other languages is plausible. How these are identified was the key concept to building an integrated language system. This research has permitted further examination into developing a new series of phonological and lexical self organising maps of Maori. Using phoneme and word maps spatially organised around lower to higher order concepts such as &#65533;sounds like&#65533;. To facilitate the high demands placed on very large data stores, the further development of the speech database management system containing phonological, phonetic, lexical, semantic, and other language frameworks was also developed. This database has helped to examine how effectively Maori has been fully integrated into an existing English framework. The bilingual system will allow full interaction with a computer-based speech architecture. This will contribute to the existing knowledge being constructed by the many different disciplines associated with languages; naturally or artificially derived. Evolving connectionist systems are new tools that are trained in an unsupervised manner to be both adaptable and flexible. This hybrid approach is an improvement on past methods in the development of more effective and efficient ways for solving applied problems for speech data analysis, classification, rule extraction, information retrieval and knowledge acquisition. A preliminary study will apply bilingual data to an &#65533;evolving clustering method&#65533; algorithm that returns a structure containing acoustic clusters plotted using visualisation techniques. In the true practical sense, the complete bilingual system has had a bi-directional approach. Both languages have undergone similar data analysis, language modelling, data access, text and speech processing, and human-computer network interface interaction.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">te reo Maori</field><field name="subject">computational linguistics</field><field name="subject">computer program language</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070517.123300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori girls, power, physical education, sport, and play : "being hungus, hori, and hoha"</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Farah Rangikoepa</field><field name="description">This research investigated how meanings associated with race, gender, and class relations in New Zealand mainstream schools are produced, reproduced, and challenged within the arenas of school sport, physical education, and physical activity. The study focused specifically on Maori girls&#65533; and young Maori women&#65533;s experiences in these arenas in order to determine how race, gender, and class identities interact, and also provided Maori girls and young women with an opportunity to be heard in research. The effects of historical and contemporary discourses, polices, and practices in New Zealand sport and school were reviewed. Theoretical perspectives and methodologies such as critical theory, kaupapa Maori research, feminism, postmodernism, and cultural studies informed the research. Qualitative methods of study such as critical ethnography, document analysis, participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and self-reflective diaries were used in order to observe, investigate, and empower the Maori girls and women, teachers, and the school involved. By utilising social reproduction concepts such as hegemony (Gramsci), discourse (Foucault), and cultural capital (Bourdieu), initiatives in schools that related to Maori girls and young women were investigated at three different levels; the fantasy discourse level, the implementation level, and the reality discourse level. The many identities and ideologies of those involved in the transformation from fantasy to reality had an effect on what was ultimately produced, reproduced, and challenged. These were also implicit and explicit ideologies operating in school sport, physical education, and physical activity arenas that worked to reproduce gendered dualisms, racial stereotypes, and class differentiation. By focusing on power relations at the structural and personal level, instances where Maori girls and young women practised &#65533;power over&#65533; others, or the &#65533;power to act&#65533; were discussed. Maori concepts such as whakaiti, whakamaa, whakahiihii, tautoko, aawhina, and manaaki, as well as more colloquial terms such as being hungus, hori, and hoha highlighted the attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviours of participants involved in the study and were used to inform the different levels of analysis. Difficulties in closing the gap between what was hoped for and what actually happened were discussed, and political and practical implications were suggested.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">young women</field><field name="subject">school sports</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.115626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-staging history : historiographic drama from New Zealand and Australia</field><field name="creator">O'Donnell, David O'Donnell</field><field name="description">Since the 1980s, there has been an increasing emphasis on drama, in live theatre and on film, which re-addresses the ways in which the post-colonial histories of Australia and New Zealand have been written. Why is there such a focus on &#65533;historical&#65533; drama in these countries at the end of the twentieth century and what does this drama contribute to wider debates about post-colonial history? This thesis aims both to explore the connections between drama and history, and to analyse the interface between live and recorded drama.
	In order to discuss these issues, I have used the work of theatre and film critics and historians, supplemented by reference to writers working in the field of post-colonial and performance theory. In particular, I have utilised the methods of Helen Gilbert and Joanne Tompkins in Post-Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice, Politics, beginning with their claim that in the post-colonial situation history has been seen to determine reality itself. I have also drawn on theorists such as Michel Foucault, Linda Hutcheon and Guy Debord who question the &#65533;truth&#65533; value of official history-writing and emphasize the role of representation in determining popular perceptions of the past. This discussion is developed through reference to contemporary performance theory, particularly the work of Richard Schechner and Marvin Carlson, in order to suggest that there is no clear separation between performance and reality, and that access to history is only possible through re-enactments of it, whether in written or performative forms.
	Chapter One is a survey of the development of &#65533;historical&#65533; drama in theatre and film from New Zealand and Australia. This includes discussion of the diverse cultural and performative traditions which influence this drama, and establishment of the critical methodologies to be used in the thesis. Chapter Two examines four plays which are intercultural re-writings of canonical texts from the European dramatic tradition. In this chapter I analyse the formal and thematic strategies in each of these plays in relation to the source texts, and ask to what extent they function as canonical counter-discourse by offering a critique of the assumptions of the earlier play from a post-colonial perspective. The potential of dramatic representation in forming perceptions of reality has made it an attractive forum for Maori and Aboriginal artists, who are creating theatre which has both a political and a pedagogical function. This discussion demonstrates that much of the impetus towards historiographic drama in both countries has come from Maori and Aboriginal writers and directors working in collaboration with white practitioners. Such collaborations not only advance the project of historiographic drama, but also may form the basis of future theatre practice which departs from the Western tradition and is unique to each of New Zealand and Australia. In Chapter Three I explore the interface between live and recorded performance by comparing plays and films which dramatise similar historical material. I consider the relative effectiveness of theatre and film as media for historiographic critique. I suggest that although film often has a greater cultural impact than theatre, to date live theatre has been a more accessible form of expression for Maori and Aboriginal writers and directors. Furthermore, following theorists such as Brecht and Brook, I argue that such aspects as the presence of the live performer and the design of the physical space shared by actors and audience give theatre considerable potential for creating an immediate engagement with historiographic themes. In Chapter Four, I discuss two contrasting examples of recorded drama in order to highlight the potential of film and television as media for historiographic critique. I question the divisions between the documentary and dramatic genres, and use Derrida&#65533;s notion of play to suggest that there is a constant slippage between the dramatic and the real, between the past and the present. In Chapter Five, I summarize the arguments advanced in previous chapters, using the example of the national museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, to illustrate that the &#65533;performance&#65533; of history has become part of popular culture. Like the interactive displays at Te Papa, the texts studied in this thesis demonstrate that dramatic representation has the potential to re-define perceptions of historical &#65533;reality&#65533;. With its superior capacity for creating illusion, film is a dynamic medium for exploring the imaginative process of history is that in the live performance the spectator symbolically comes into the presence of the past.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historical drama</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">decolonization</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">films</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.151011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digging up data: a reanalysis of so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; tools</field><field name="creator">Jones, Brenda M</field><field name="description">Elsdon Best&#65533;s 1925 work Maori Agriculture has been influential in New Zealand archaeology impacting on the terminology and assumed functions applied to so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; implements retrieved in excavations, as well as those in museums and private collections. This thesis critically examines Best&#65533;s horticultural tool classification and the decisions he made with regards to tool function. Ethnographic accounts are investigated in an effort to understand how and why Best selected the terms and functions that he did. The literature review reveals anomalies in the conclusions that Best drew and the morphology of the tools that he described, highlighting the lack of order and confusion surrounding horticultural tool function, terminology and morphology, and prompting a much needed reassessment of horticultural implements.
	A study of artefacts from New Zealand museums was undertaken with the aim of generating two typologies for so called &#65533;horticultural&#65533; tools. The artefacts are classified to specific types using specified attributes, and following the classification process, are investigated for metric and non-metric variables that are indicative of the tool&#65533;s function. Graphical and basic statistical analyses revealed largely unimodal distributions for the metric attributes recorded for each tool type. Non-metric qualities also displayed a uniformity to their occurrence within the individual types.
	The data for each type is discussed with regards to tool function, combining the results of the attribute analyses with comparable tool morphologies from other Pacific cultures. The distribution of tool types in prehistoric New Zealand is also investigated in an effort to elucidate tool function.

Cultural heritage symbolises the development of a society, illustrating past events and changing customs and values. Because of its significance, the government has accepted responsibility for protecting cultural heritage, and has developed a number of institutions and a variety of policies to address this responsibility. It is important to understand how the goverment uses these mechanisms to protect cultural heritage, and the subsequent relationships that have developed between actors in the cultural heritage area. These will have an impact on the effectiveness of the policy which is developed.
	Cultural heritage is treasured by society for a number of reasons, but as social attitudes change, so does the treatment of cultural heritage. It is re-defined, re-interpreted and used to promote a sense of pride in the commmunity. This manipulation extends to policy making. Since the 1980s, the government has influenced, and been influenced by, two major social changes. There has been an introduction of free market principles such as rationalisation, competition and fiscal responsibility into the New Zealand economy and political structure. These principles have been applied to cultural heritage and consequently cultural heritage is treated as a commodity. As the result of changing attitudes towards the treatment of the Maori and Maori resources, there has been a movement towards implementing biculturalism. This has meant a re-evaluation of how Maori taonga is treated, particularly of the ways Maori cultural heritage has been used to promote a sense of New Zealandness.
	There are several major actors involved in cultural heritage policy making - government, policy units, cultural heritage organisations and local authorities. Central government is the dominant force in the political process, with control over the distribution of resources and the responsibilities assigned to other actors. Because the use of market principles and movement towards biculturalism have been embraced at the central government level, other actors in the policy making process are also expected to adopt them. Policy units develop options to fit with the government&#65533;s general economic and political agenda. The structures adopted for the public service are designed to encompass market principles, particularly the efficient use of resources and competitiveness. While cultural heritage organisations may influence the government&#65533;s agenda through lobbying and information-sharing, they are limited by issues such as funding and statutory requirements. Government has shifted many responsibilities to the regions, but while territorial authorities are influenced by the concerns of their communities, they are also subject to directions from the government.
	The process and structures which have been outlined do not contribute to an effective policy making system. The use of market principles to direct cultural heritage protection tends to encourage uneven and inconsistent policies, both at national and local levels. The range of cultural heritage definitions used by government agencies also promotes inconsistency. Cultural heritage is encompassed in a large number of government departments and ministries, which makes the co-ordination funding by meeting required &#65533;outputs&#65533; and the government&#65533;s requirement of fiscal responsibility. This is not appropriate language for cultural heritage, which should not have to be rationalised as an economic good. Although the government has devolved a number of responsibilities and territorial authorities have a variety of mechanisms available to protect cultural heritage, there is no nation-wide criteria for territorial involvement. Because of regional differences there is an uneven treatment of cultural heritage. Those policies developed by territorial authorities will also be influenced by the government&#65533;s economic direction. Organisations supported by the Dunedin City Council, for example, must also provide budgets and strategic plans which fit with Council&#65533;s fiscal objectives.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">cultural property</field><field name="subject">heritage</field><field name="subject">art and state</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.152110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;Where land meets water&#65533; : rights to the foreshore of Otakou Maori Reserve</field><field name="creator">Hanham, Susan Janette</field><field name="description">Rights to possess and/or use the foreshore of New Zealand are not clear, and are even cloudier in relation to Maori freehold land that is on the coast. This thesis investigates the law pertaining to rights in the foreshore, and the facts pertaining specifically to the use of the Otakou Maori Reserve foreshore. In particular, the research question is this: what does aboriginal title mean in 1996 for Otago Maori? Examining the legal issues, searching individual titles and gathering oral history are the methods used to answer this question.
	First, the law. In New Zealand the Crown is prima facie the absolute owner of the foreshore. This can be displaced by proof to the contrary. The doctrine of aboriginal title recognises the legal continuity of tribal property rights upon the Crown&#65533;s acquisition of sovereignty over their territory. Aboriginal title can be divided into two categories - territorial and non-territorial. Territorial title represents a tribal claim to full ownership, and non-territorial title to rights that are less than absolute ownership, such as the right to cross land, to fish and to collect flora and fauna. It is this doctrine of aboriginal title as it relates to the foreshore that can displace the Crown&#65533;s absolute ownership of the foreshore.
	Second, the facts. 99% of the coastal land parcels of Otakou Maori Reserve are described in written documentation as to the line of mean high water. This 99% is made up 17% Maori freehold land, 49% general land and 33% vested in the Crown or the Dunedin City Council. The remaining 1% is Maori freehold land that does not have its boundary at mean high water, but has a fixed upland boundary. Oral history facts from the takatawhenua identify that the foreshore continues to be used for access, travel, and the collection of kai moana and sea resources.
	The findings reveal that Kai Tahu ki Otakou have never extinguised their territorial and non-territorial aboriginal title to the foreshore of Otakou Maori Reserve. Suggested areas for future research include an investigation of other Maori reserves in Otago, and examining the doctrine of aboriginal title as it relates to the beds of watercourses.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">land title</field><field name="subject">coastal zone management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.153901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Kuri in prehistory : a skeletal analysis of the extinct Maori dog</field><field name="creator">Clark, Geoffrey R</field><field name="description">Skeletal remains of the prehistoric New Zealand dog, the kuri, are frequently recovered from archaeological sites.

	This study set out to provide a more detailed skeletal description and to investigate the question of population homogeneity by examinig kuri skeletal material from five museums and two university anthropology departments. Metric and non-metric data was collected from a total of thirty seven archaeological sites from throuhout New Zealand.
	Variation within the population was established by comparing coefficients of variation across a number of variables. A program of univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out to examine spatial and temporal variation.
	Results showed that the appendicular skeleton of the kuri has the highest levels of variation. Smaller limb shaft dimensions of late prehistoric kuri are thought to be due to a reliance on insufficient quantities of marine foods.

The present study shows that Maori people are concerned that the power and control over research issues of initiation, benefits, representation, legitimation and accountability are addressed by the imposition of the researcher&#65533;s agenda, concerns and interests on the research process. Such dominance of a Western orientated discourse is being challenged by a pro-active, Kaupapa Maori research approach. This approach is part of the revitalisation of Maori cultural aspirations, preferences and practices as a philosophical and productive educational stance and resistance to the hegemony of the dominant discourse in Aotearoa/New Zealand.
	Kaupapa Maori research is collectivistic, and is orientated toward benefiting all the research participants and their collectively determined agendas. Kaupapa Maori Research is based on growing concensus that research involving Maori knowledge and people needs to be conducted in culturally appropriate ways, ways that fit Maori cultural preferences, practices and aspirations in order to develop and acknowledge existing culturally appropriate approaches in the method, practice and organisation of research. This thesis examines how a group of researchers have addressed the importance of devolving power and control in the research exercise in order to promote self-determination (tino Rangatiratanga) of Maori people. In the thesis I have talked with researchers who have accepted the challenge of positioning themselves within the discursive practice that is Kaupapa Maori. As a result, this thesis examines how such positionings challenge what constitutes a process of theory generation within the context of Aotearoa/New Zealand.
	This thesis further seeks to examine a way of knowing that reflects what meanings I can construct from my positioning within an experiential Kaupapa Maori research matrix. My position within this matrix resulted from critical reflections on my participation in a research group with an agreed-to agenda, my participation within the projects considered in the narratives in this thesis, my talking with other research participants in the form termed "interviews as chat" and from our constructing joint narratives about their/our attempts to address Maori concerns about research in their practice.
	The broad methodological framework used in the thesis is narrative inquiry for such an approach allows the research participants to select, recollect and reflect on stories within their own cultural context and language rather than in that chosen by the researcher. In other words, the story teller maintains the power to define what constitutes the story and the truth and the meaning it has for them. Further, this thesis seeks to investigate my own position as a researcher within a co-joint reflection on shared experiences and co-joint construction of meanings about these experiences, a position where the stories of the other research participants merged with my own to create new stories. Such collaborative stories go beyond an approach that simply focusses on the cooperative sharing of experiences and focusses on connectedness, engagement, and involvement with the other research participants within the cultural world view/discursive practice within which they function. This thesis seeks to identify what constitutes this engagement and what implications this has for promoting self determination/agency/voice in the research participants by examining concepts of participatory consciousness and connectedness within Maori discursive practice.
	Whakawhanaungatanga (establishing relationships in a Maori context), is used metaphorically to give voice to a culturally positioned means of collaboratively constructing research stories in a &#65533;culturally conscious and connected manner&#65533;. The thesis explains that there are three major overlapping implications of whakawhanaungatanga as a research strategy. The first is that establishing and maintaining relationships is a fundamental, often extensive and ongoing part of the research process. This involves the establishment of &#65533;whanau of interest&#65533; through a process of &#65533;spiral dicourse&#65533;. The second is that researchers understand themselves to be involved somatically in the research process; that is physically, ethically, morally and spiritually and not just as a &#65533;researcher&#65533; concerned with methodology. Such positionings are demonstrated in the language/metaphor used by the researchers in the stories described in this thesis. The third is that establishing relationships in a Maori context addresses the power and control issues fundamental to research, because it involves participatory research practices, in this context, termed &#65533;Participant Driven research&#65533;.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.124559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing a colonial hangover : towards bicultural planning in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Andrew</field><field name="description">Planning, specifically resource management, is an activity of the state which should seek to reflect the values of the people.

	(2) to examine the current resource management system in New Zealand in order to establish the basis for a bicultural approach to planning.
	These aims were addressed in two principal ways. First, a critical review of literature provided comprehensive background on the relationship between Western and non-Western cultures. Second, in depth interviews were held with both Maori and non-Maori involved in resource management structures. Data from these interviews illustrate Maori opinion on the current resource management system in New Zealand.
	The thesis concludes that biculturalism is the only legitimate structure for state policy in New Zealand. This conclusion is based primarily on the relationship established between the indigenous Maori and the Pakeha settlers through the Treaty of Waitangi.
	This study also found that the current resource management regime in New Zealand is incapable of supporting a bicultural resource management approach. Radical reforms are needed in order to facilitate bicultural planning. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to the current regime which will facilitate a bicultural approach to New Zealand planning.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.125653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The morphology of the pre-European Maori femur and its functional significance</field><field name="creator">Hay, Alistair</field><field name="description">The life of the pre-European Maori consisted of subsistence strategies ranging from hunter-gatherer to horticultural activities. The femur of both sexes is generally characterised by a flattened proximal shaft rotated inward, and by a short, markedly bowed, robust diaphysis. Femoral rugosity denotes the attachment of relatively great thigh musculature which, in turn, is an indicator of the levels of physical activity associated with the subsistence strategies undertaken. The femoral neck and head is distinguished from contemporary populations and those of comparative subsistence strategies by a larger anterior offset (anteversion) and greater horizontal inclination (Coxa valga). In addition to consistently large femoral anteversion, the femoral head is denoted by a broad, horizontally oval insertion for the ligament of the head (fovea). These external morphological traits are such consistent features within the femur they represent racial attributes of the pre-European Maori population. The femoral morphology of the pre-European Maori has been described by earlier researchers dating back 109 years to 1886. However, there have been limited functional evaluations of the external traits, in particular, how traits are associated with respect to each other. To resolve these limitations and determine a biological basis to femoral morphology a comprehensive analysis of external traits from the femur and pelvis is combined with the biomechanical properties of geometric profiles at six cross-sectional levels of the diaphysis.
	From six major regions within New Zealand a total of 107 pooled femora in three catalogued &#65533;series&#65533; were measured, of these 52 are male and 55 female, and there are 22 pairs (11 male pairs, 11 female pairs). The external traits measured comprise articular areas, femoral angles, diaphyseal dimensions, and anterior shaft curvature. In addition, pelvic dimensions for matching femora are recorded. Cross-sectional parameters derived from profile areas and second moments of area provide information on compressive strength, and bending rigidities and orientation at each cross-sectional level. Statistical methods employed are univariate F-ratios and Student&#65533;s t-test, bivariate correlation coefficients, and multivariate principal components, discriminant function, and linear regression.
	In this study of the pre-European Maori it is suggested that the normal developmental changes in femoral angles are prevented by extrinsic mechanical influences, such as habitual posture, high levels of physical activity, and greater musculature that alter growth plate morphogenesis. Femoral angles are &#65533;set&#65533; on epiphyseal fusion and have limited ability to remodel. The femoral diaphysis in the adult undergoes continual remodelling at the periosteal and endosteal surfaces and provides adaptive plasticity to mechanical loading at the hip and knee. Results indicate differences in absolute and relative values of external and cross-sectional traits that indicate mechanical loading patterns specific to each sex.
	Functional interpretation of inter-trait associations suggests that; 1) associations between external traits indicate the functional effect of growth and development on femoral size and shape characteristics. 2) Associations within cross-sectional parameters show relationships between appositional remodelling activity and structural strength. 3) Associations between external and internal traits indicate the importance of mechanical loading patterns established during growth and adulthood to final femoral morphology and subsequently to adaptive remodelling of the adult shaft.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">paleopathology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.094956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Horticulture in prehistoric New Zealand : an investigation of the function of the stone walls of Palliser Bay</field><field name="creator">Leach, Helen M</field><field name="description">Low stone rows and alignments were reported as early as 1904 on the coastal platform of eastern Palliser Bay. In all subsequent references it was assumed that the features were horticultural and, on the grounds of their appearance, of considereable age. Methodical investigation of these claims within the context of a three year archaeological programme (1969-1972) including analysis of prehistoric settlements, economy, and physical anthropology, was regarded as a worthwhile project, since orthodox opinion at the time favoured a later introduction of Polynesian horticulture some centuries after initial settlement of New Zealand about the 9th century AD.
	Extensive field surveys showed that at least 93ha of the coastal platform between Whatarangi and Cape Palliser had been subject to stone clearance according to several simple principles, such as equal access to the best soils, maintenance of a rectilinear system, and the clear separation of individual plots with boundary markers and paths. In addition, excavations conducted within the major complexes revealed artiificial deepening of the prehistoric topsoil, frequent incorporation of wood charcoal, rare addition of beach gravel, and inclusion of domestic refuse where the walls were adjacent to coastal villages. Both radio-carbon dates and artefacts found in association with the stone structures indicate early establishment of horticulture on this coast by the 12th century AD with an apparent peak of activity and complexity of garden system before the beginning of the 15th century, followed by decline and virtual abandonment.
	Climatic conditions prevailing in Palliser Bay today preclude cultivation of all Polynesian cultigens except the kumara (Ipomoea batatas) and gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). It is now accepted that mean annual temperature at the time of settlement was 1&#65533; - 2&#65533;C higher. Even so, growing season length and rainfall would probably not have been adequate for crops such as taro or yam.
	Within New Zealand, the kumara gardens of Palliser Bay find close parallels on both sides of Cook Strait, and on the eastern coast of the Wairarapa. Similar principles of garden layout applied in the larger Auckland wall complexes, and in 18th century gardens north of Hawkes Bay. From a survey of tropical Polynesian garden structures it appears that an extensive repertoire of horticultural techniques was introduced by the first settlers to temperate New Zealand and despite the loss of variety in cultigens it persisted until the 18th century as a viable means of subsistence.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">gardening</field><field name="subject">food cultivation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.133750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The protohistoric period of Wairarapa culture history</field><field name="creator">Mair, Gaela M.</field><field name="description">Summary:  In the last two decades, the development of New Zealand prehistory has seen a movement away from a strong emphasis on archaeology to a growing concern with synthesis and theory. One aspect of this has been the prolonged discussion of the cultural status of the New Zealand Maori during the &#65533;Classic Maori Phase&#65533;. In part this was stimulated by an increase in knowledge of the earlier Archaic period (Duff, 1956:73-82). It was also influenced by a widespread interest in the records of early voyagers and travellers encouraged by the wealth of new editions available (for example, the Beaglehole editions of the journals of Cook and Banks).
	The inadequacies of the archaeological assemblages belonging to this phase were acknowledged at the Second Annual Conference of the New Zealand Archaeological Association (Golson, 1957:279). Consequently, many prehistorians began to regard these records as supplementary information. Observations made by Europeans, as visitors or residents in New Zealand were compiled in order to delineate the differences between the earlier and later phases of New Zealand prehistory (Golson, 1957:279-280; Golson and Gathercole, 1962:271).
	The past seven years have been seen a marked upsurge of interest in the precise details of culture contact between European and Maori during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This period of initial contact was named the &#65533;protohistoric&#65533; period of Maori culture in line with the terminology adopted overseas (Golson and Gathercole, 1962:173). The French, who differentiated between the prehistoric period when writing was non-existent, and the historic period when cultural developments could be studied with the aid of written documents, introduced the term &#65533;protohistoric&#65533; to mark the early historic period when written documents were occasionally produced, but not on a universal scale (Hawkes, 1951: 1, 3)--Chapter One.</field><field name="date">1972</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Wairarapa</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.084801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subsistence patterns in prehistoric New Zealand : a consideration of the implications of seasonal and regional variability of food resources for the study of prehistoric economies.</field><field name="creator">Leach, H.M.

Whether the aims of prehistoric re-construction are to write the &#65533;anthropology of dead peoples&#65533; (Heizer and Graham, 1967), or to explore the dynamics of culture history (Chang, 1967), such re-construction necessitates the use of additional non-archaeological data. Although some disagreement exists over the most salutory means of applying the results of research in the social and natural sciences, there is little doubt that prehistory benefits from the association.
	This dissertation, which was undertaken to assess the role of supplementary data in New Zealand prehistoric research, employs two types of non-archaeological evidence: ethnographical-historical data, and methods for assessing subsistence activities from scientific data.

As European New Zealanders were in 1859 experiencing their third year of Responsible Government, the tone of public opinion is of particular interest, for theoretically the widely enfranchised public had it in their power to influence official policy by their votes. Although the field of Responsible Government did not, in theory, extend to Native Affairs, in practice this limitation was by no means absolute. Gore Browne&#65533;s power of ultimate decision was considerably modified by his avowed ignorance of Maori language, character, and customs; and by his dependence on the representative Assembly for funds to execute a positive native policy. He thus relied heavily on the Staff of the Native Department to supply his former deficiency; and agreed to allow a responsible minister to advise him on Native Affairs. This system in practice prevented the formulation and execution of a positive native policy, and involved a dangerous opportunity for irresponsible action. The equivocal nature of responsibility for native affairs was also a handicap to the development of public opinion, which was unable to concentrate on a supreme source of effective authority. For these reasons, the essay will contain particular reference to the question of divided responsibility.</field><field name="date">1958</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.143409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern medicine and the Sherpa of Khumbu : exploring the histories of Khunde Hospital, Nepal 1966-1998</field><field name="creator">Heydon, Susan</field><field name="description">The celebrated Sherpas of Himalayan mountaineering, who lived in the rugged high-altitude environment of the Everest area of Nepal, lacked Western style medical services and so iconic New Zealander, Sir Edmund Hillary, 'hero' of Everest, built them a small hospital in 1966. He administered Khunde Hospital through the Himalayan Trust, but with substantial support, since the late-1970s, from the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation in Canada. Overseas medical volunteers assisted by local staff provided a range of outpatient and inpatient, curative and preventive services. The history of Khunde Hospital, therefore, provides a case study for the introduction of modern medicine, as Sherpas referred to Western or biomedicine, and for the implementation of an overseas aid project. 
 In my analysis I have moved away from a binary, oppositional examination of a cross-cultural encounter and have situated Khunde Hospital in a conceptual device of 'worlds'. I argue that the hospital existed and operated simultaneously within multiple separate yet interconnected worlds, but do not privilege one discourse over another. These worlds work beyond culture, encompassing institutions, political structures and knowledge communities and were physical, social and intellectual spaces within which there were rules and norms of behaviour that structured action. 
 In order to explore the histories of Khunde Hospital I set it within four distinct but overlapping worlds: that of Sir Edmund Hillary, the Sherpa, Western medicine and international aid. These are worlds that I have identified as being important for the questions I am looking at. My central discussion is the ongoing encounter between Sherpa beliefs and practices about sickness and modern medicine, particularly looking at the individual patient&#65533;s use and non-use of the hospital and how staff there responded. The response was neither a one-way diffusion of Western medical practice, nor a collision between the spirit-suffused system of the Sherpa and scientific biomedicine. People used the hospital for some things but not others, based on their perception as to whether the hospital was the effective, appropriate option to take. Over the years, the hospital and community became used to each other in a relationship that was in practice a coexistence of difference. Each acknowledged and could incorporate aspects of the other&#65533;s beliefs and practices when dealing with a person&#65533;s sickness, but remained separate. 
 Using the conceptual device of worlds, however, suggests the need for this example of the introduction and spread of Western medicine to be grounded in a consideration of Hillary&#65533;s particular form of aid, the shifting discourse of international medical aid between the 1960s and the 1990s and the unique world of the Sherpa of Khumbu. All of these worlds influenced the provision of health care at and from Khunde Hospital in different ways, sometimes separately but often simultaneously, and at some times and for some issues more than others. People, place and relationships often had as much influence as - and sometimes more than - the medicine. If the key to understanding Khunde Hospital is the relationship between Sherpas and Hillary and the respect that began in a partnership on the mountains in the 1950s, then the multiple worlds of Khunde Hospital underscore the complexities of implementing Sherpa requests to build a hospital in their rugged home near the world&#65533;s highest mountain.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Khunde Hospital</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">Nepalese</field><field name="subject">Khumbu Valley</field><field name="subject">Sherpa</field><field name="subject">Sir Edmund Hillary</field><field name="subject">Customs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070119.122329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and variability of temperature extremes in Southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Paula</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to create the longest possible, homogeneous, historical daily temperature dataset for Southern New Zealand, analyse the changes in extreme temperatures and investigate atmospheric circulation patterns that contributed to these changes. Daily minimum and maximum temperature data for Southern New Zealand were captured from paper records and extended to include all available archival data from the region. This dataset was digitised and contains temperatures from 26 stations that began operation sometime in the period between 1852 and 1953. Stations include the Chatham and Campbell islands. Adjustments for inhomogeneities in the dataset were made using a frequency distribution matching method. Dunedin has a record dating from 1852, the longest in the Southern Hemisphere south of 40&#65533;S latitude. Reconstruction of a homogeneous record for Dunedin was made by taking into account site changes from contemporaneous modem data logger measurements and from an analysis of overlapping period data. Temperatures showed no clear pattern of change in Southern New Zealand from the mid 1800s through to the early 1900s with the exception of a brief cold period that occurred around 1900. However, from the 1940s through to the 1970s both minimum and maximum extreme temperatures showed strong warming. These trends were duplicated over the shorter length period of record for other regions, especially in Eastern Canterbury. The warming trend was maintained over the period 1979 - 2003, but only in the colder ends of minimum and maximum distributions. Temperatures have become less cold due to the recent compression of the temperature distribution. There was a marked decrease in cold days at stations in the south and offshore islands. Atmospheric circulation pattems, and in particular ENSO, were shown to affect extreme temperatures recorded in Southern New Zealand. Anomalous southwesterlies associated with El Nino events produce cooler temperatures and increase the numbers of cold extreme temperatures, while anomalous northeasterlies typical of La Nina increase the numbers of warm extreme temperatures. Monthly frequencies of extreme temperatures were primarily affected by anomalous south/north meridional airflows to increase cold/warm extreme temperature frequencies. Zonal airflows have a lesser, but topographically influenced effect. Record hot and cold temperatures in Southern New Zealand were a product of the interaction between advective northerly and southerly airflows respectively, and local climatic effects caused by topography.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="subject">meteorology</field><field name="subject">observations</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070514.100400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical volcanology of the Sterkspruit flood basalt crater complex, South Africa</field><field name="creator">McClintock, Murray</field><field name="description">Volcanism associated with the onset of Karoo flood basalt eruptions (c. 180 Ma) at Sterkspruit, South Africa, began with emplacement of thin lava flows before abruptly switching to phreatomagmatic and magmatic activity that formed a nest of craters, spatter and tuff rings and cones that collectively comprise a crater complex &gt;40 km&#65533; filled by 9-18 km&#65533; of volcaniclastic debris. Phreatomagmatic activity driven by interaction of Karoo magma with groundwater hosted in country rock and crater-filling debris quarried broad, mainly shallow craters (hundreds of metres, but not kilometers deep) into wall-rock. Closely spaced individual vents, the consequence of magma emplaced over a broad area through a network of feeder dikes and stocks, were active at the same time or over short periods of time. Highly ephemeral access of external water to vents drove repeated and reversible switches between explosive to effusive magmatic and explosive phreatomagmatic activity, resulting in vents and craters that grew laterally and vertically into adjacent ones through quarrying and vent migration. 
 Deposits within the Sterkspruit crater complex are dominated by 7-15 km&#65533; of massive, unsorted polymict lapilli tuff and tuff breccia juxtaposed with localised fountain-fed lava and strombolian spatter deposits. Transport within the complex was dominated by jets and fountains of volcaniclastic debris and by mass movement. Country-rock breccias indicate that craters grew via a combination of mechanical fragmentation, granulation and mass-movement of 7-12 km&#65533; of wall-rock, adding mass and previously locked-up pore-water to the volcanic system. Ash and lapilli, the deposits of plumes 5-15 km high, form a 50-110 m-thick ejecta blanket mantling Clarens Formation country rock that thins gradually away from the crater-complex margins. Explosive volcanism was succeeded by brief fluvial and eolian reworking of volcaniclastic debris and formation of a shallow crater lake 12 km&#65533; in extent, and then by voluminous effusion of flood basalt that inundated the Sterkspruit crater complex with lava. 
 Flood basalt magmas involved in Sterkspruit eruptions were chemically heterogenous. This study documents the rapid (perhaps simultaneous) eruption of multiple, chemically distinct basaltic magmas, which cannot be simply related to one another, from one vent site, and possibly many others, within the Sterkspruit crater complex. Five distinct magma types were involved in eruptions at Sterkspruit, indicating that in the early stages of flood basalt eruption (i) magma batches may be small and not simply related to one another, (ii) heterogeneities in the magma source region may be close to each other in time and space, and (iii) eruptions of chemically distinct magmas may take place over short intervals of space and time without significant hybridisation. 
 Formation of the Sterkspruit Complex, and many others like it in South Africa, confirms that the opening phases of Karoo flood basalt volcanism were explosive, and that the volume of the products of explosive volcanism may have important implications for climate change and landscape development associated with the emplacement of large igneous provinces.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">volcanological research</field><field name="subject">Sterkspruit</field><field name="subject">basalt</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.161342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s Ceferino series : spanish crime fiction and the carnivalesque</field><field name="creator">Trotman, Tiffany Gagliardi</field><field name="description">In the wake of Francisco Franco&#65533;s long dictatorship, various new forms of literature emerged in Spain. A new period of transformation, the so-called Spanish Transition, fostered an environment of experimentation and innovation free from the restrictive barriers of Franco&#65533;s regime. The Transition proved a period of great hopes and expectations as well as disillusionment and disappointment. This time, above all, provided an opportunity to reflect critically on the history and experience of the nation in the 20th century. 
 Eduardo Mendoza is one among a generation of writers that experienced the early years of the Transition, the subsequent emergence of the Socialist Party and the reintroduction of Spain to Europe and, indeed, the rest of the world post 1975. This noted Catalan is one of several distinguished writers working within a new genre, the Spanish novela negra, or crime novel. In particular, he has written three novels El misterio de la cripta embrujada (1979), El laberinto de las aceitunas (1982) and La aventura del tocador de senoras (2001); each featuring an unlikely detective known as Ceferino. 
 In this thesis, I examine Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s three crime novels as a carnivalesque discourse. The work relies on the theory outlined by Mikhail Bakhtin in two of his foundational texts, Problems of Dostoevsky&#65533;s Poetics (1929) and Rabelais&#65533; World (1940). In 1929, Bakhtin sketched out the idea of "carnivalization" as the transposition of the spirit of carnival into art. It was not until his thesis (now known as Rabelais&#65533; World) was published in 1960 however that his vision of carnival was understood and the link between the carnivalized text and popular culture emerged. This research focuses on Bakhtin&#65533;s four 'categories of carnival': free and familiar contact, eccentricity, carnivalistic mesalliances, and profanation, in order to develop a critical framework by which a text may be defined as carnivalesque. Through a comprehensive examination of what each of these categories entails, Bakhtin&#65533;s paradigm is linked to Eduardo Mendoza&#65533;s crime trilogy and these texts are consequently defined as undeniably carnivalesque. 
 The conclusion of the thesis suggests several possibilities as to why Eduardo Mendoza, as a contemporary Spanish crime fiction writer, employs a carnivalesque discourse to depict post-Franco culture. The Transition and the decade between 1982 and 1992 are defined as periods of rupture from the official order. These years are considered an ideal environment for the unleashing of a carnivalesque ambiance in Spain that inherently effected the aesthetic production of the period, and specifically the works of Eduardo Mendoza.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eduardo Mendoza (1943)</field><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">detective</field><field name="subject">mystery</field><field name="subject">stories</field><field name="subject">Aventura del tocador de senoras</field><field name="subject">Laberinto de las aceitunas</field><field name="subject">Misterio de la cripta embrujada</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070613.114325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining the revealed God : Hans Urs von Balthasar, Eberhard Jungel, and the triduum mortis</field><field name="creator">Sharman, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">'Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds.' [Rom 12:2] 
 Hans Urs von Balthasar and Eberhard Jungel are profound and imaginative thinkers who unreservedly ground their theologies in revelation as God&#65533;s self-disclosure. This thesis asks what resources such revelation-centred authors, from different traditions, may contribute to a theological understanding of the human imagination. Although theology has often been more interested in the constructive capacities of the imagination, it is the responsive quality of the imagination that is of particular interest to this thesis. Can the imagination contribute to a theological understanding which comprehends the action and speech of God as antecedent to human response? 
 This thesis examines the epistemological issues that are related both to the imagination and to revelation as the self-communication and self-interpretation of God. The imagination is conceived of as essential to perception and understanding; it allows for both recognition and re-cognition. Through the imagination we can rethink the patterns or paradigms that shape our lives. The renewing of the mind can be said to involve the imagination. However, spiritual transformation requires more than a notion of the imagination as a spontaneous mental act which determines its own content. Balthasar and Jungel, while thinking in lively and narrative ways, are constrained by divine self-disclosure. God&#65533;s self-revelation provides the content of the paradigm or pattern by which the Christian believer is to live. The imagination can be said to act as the context or locus of revelation. 
 This thesis demonstrates that the three days of Easter are central to Balthasar&#65533;s and Jungel&#65533;s respective understandings of God. For Balthasar and Jungel, the triduum mortis is where the self-revelation of God is most apparent; it is here that God is understood to be self-giving love as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. While quite distinct in their approaches, both authors work within trinitarian, and therefore relational, frameworks. This thesis traces the motifs that not only express their understandings of the paschal mystery in relational terms but also ground their respective understandings of renewed existence; for Balthasar, the motifs of mission and kenosis, and for Jungel, those of identification and justification. For both Balthasar and Jungel, the events of the triduum mortis can be said to provide the content of, and act as a boundary to, our conception of God. Nonetheless, it is proposed that, within their respective understandings of divine prevenience, Balthasar and Jungel leave room for the exercise of the imagination. God is mystery; God is not a fixed or completed concept.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-1988)</field><field name="subject">Eberhard Jungel</field><field name="subject">Trinity</field><field name="subject">God</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">Theory of Knowledge</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">knowableness</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070615.112629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relative importance of mainstream water velocity and physiology (nutrient demand) on the growth rate of Adamsiella chauvinii</field><field name="creator">Kregting, Louise Theodora</field><field name="description">A prevailing view exists in the literature which suggests that macroalgae growing in slow-flow environments (&lt;4 cm s&#8315;&#65533;) are less productive because of "mass-transfer" limitation compared to fast-flow environments. Macroalgae in slow-flow environments are thought to have thicker diffusion boundary-layers which limit the flux of essential molecules to and from the algal thallus. However nutrient demand of a macroalga can also influence nutrient flux. The main objective of this research was to determine the relative importance of physical (mainstream velocity) and physiological (nutrient demand) factors influencing the growth rate of Adamsiella chauvinii, a small (&lt;20 cm) red algal species, that grows within the benthic boundary-layer in a soft sediment habitat. To establish the influence of water velocity, the growth rate of A. chauvinii was measured in situ each month (March 2003 to March 2004) at three sites with varying degrees of water velocity (slow, intermediate and fast) at which all other environmental parameters (photon flux density, seawater temperature and nutrients) were similar. To determine the metabolic demand and nutrient uptake rate of A. chauvinii, the internal nutrient status (C:N, soluble tissue nitrate, ammonium and phosphate), uptake kinetics (V[max] and K[s]) and nutrient uptake rate at a range of mainstream velocities were also determined on a seasonal basis. The hydrodynamic environment around A. chauvinii canopies was characterised in situ and compared with controlled laboratory experiments. 
 Growth rates of Adamsiella chauvinii thalli at the slow-flow site were significantly lower in winter (June) to summer (February) than the intermediate- and fast-flow sites, while in autumn growth rates were similar between sites. However, A. chauvinii at the slow-flow site had similar or higher tissue N content compared to thalli at the other two sites during winter, spring and summer suggesting that growth rates of A. chauvinii were not mass-transfer limited. Nitrogen uptake rates of A. chauvinii were similar between sites in summer and winter, however uptake rates were lower in summer compared to winter even though thalli were nitrogen limited in summer. Water velocity had no effect on nitrate uptake in either summer or winter and uptake of ammonium increased with increasing water velocity during summer only. Two hydrodynamically different environments were distinguished over a canopy of A. chauvinii, with both the laboratory and field velocity profiles in good agreement with each other. In the top half of the canopy, the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) and Reynolds stresses were greatest while in the bottom half of the canopy flow rates were less than 90 % of mainstream velocity (&lt; 1 cm s&#8315;&#65533;). 
 When considered together, the influence of water velocity on the growth rates of A. chauvinii was not completely clear. Results suggest that mainstream velocity had little influence on nutrient availability to A. chauvinii because of the unique hydrodynamic environment created by the canopy. Nutrients, especially ammonium and phosphate, derived from the sediment and invertebrates, may provide enough nitrogen and phosphate to saturate the metabolic demand of Adamsiella chauvinii, consequently, A. chauvinii is well adapted to this soft-sediment environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">algology</field><field name="subject">red algae</field><field name="subject">microalgae</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070806.121216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For better or for worse ... : a case study analysis of social services partnerships in Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Peter E</field><field name="description">Partnerships between organizations are seen as one of the building blocks of the &#65533;Third Way&#65533; approach to welfare provision both in Europe and in New Zealand. While there is much discussion of this emphasis on building social capital and working in partnerships these partnerships are usually perceived as being between government and community or private organizations as part of a new phase of neo-liberalism. Using qualitative research this thesis explores three partnership sites: Those within a Maori social service provider, Te Whanau Arohanui, and the local Hapu and State organisations; that between the Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre (an indigenous organization) and the Dunedin Community Law Centre; and finally the State lead Strengthening Families partnership initiative. 
 This thesis is concerned with the development of citizen participation in public policy decision-making through partnerships. While contemporary studies of policy change have identified stakeholder and actor-network forms as dominant these often seem even less democratic, participatory, accountable and transparent than those they have supposedly replaced. I draw on ideas of deliberative governance to explore options for both the theory and practice of sustainable, permanent and participatory policy change in an age of diversity. I suggest that the practice of Community Development is needed to supplement descriptive and post-facto accounts of policy change and so create a usable practice theory of effective mechanisms for participatory input. 
 Using a series of case studies of partnerships, a tentative practice theory and strategy for change is proposed. This is set within an interactive framework that is able to confront levels of power to encourage diversity and participation in decision-making from bottom-up initiatives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public welfare</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social services</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">social conditions</field><field name="subject">Te Whanau Arohanui Trust</field><field name="subject">Dunedin Community Law Centre</field><field name="subject">Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070914.145613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A consumer-oriented view of quality : an exploratory study of quality in the context of marketing&#65533;s scholarly articles</field><field name="creator">Rosenstreich, Daniela</field><field name="description">Current models of quality in the marketing discipline tend to have a producer orientation. Influences on quality outside the control of the firm, such as consumer perceptions or needs, are only addressed in a rudimentary manner. While quality is acknowledged as being determined by the consumer and akin to an attitude, ironically, literature on quality is not well grounded in relevant theory from psychology and related disciplines. 
 This thesis presents an exploration of quality and its meaning within the context of assessing scholarly marketing articles. The objective of the study is to develop a new consumer- oriented model of quality to enhance understanding of the construct, enabling marketers to better influence consumers&#65533; assessment of quality. 
 The academic marketplace involves articulate and experienced producers, channel members and consumers. An investigation of quality within the context of marketing&#65533;s scholarly articles therefore provides rich material for refining the quality construct. The first stage of the research addressed two research questions related to scholarly articles: RQ1: What intrinsic factors (article attributes) influence quality assessments? RQ2: What extrinsic factors (external to the article) influence quality assessments? 
 The components of quality in scholarly articles were drawn from several sources: literature sources; journal editorial policies; key informant interviews; and analysis of the content and editorial boards of the top journals. Overall, results suggested a connection between consumers&#65533; assessments of quality and factors such as their belief structures, reference group norms, and consumption context. 
 The empirical findings led to further investigation through literature analysis. Theories from psychology helped to explain the interplay of beliefs, attitudes and perceptions in quality assessments and suggest consumer characteristics (such as the rigidity of mental sets, or novelty seeking behaviour) that influence that interplay. 
 On a theoretical level, the new quality model integrates theories of psychology with product-oriented aspects providing a multifaceted view of the quality construct. This is achieved by using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the central framework, providing a robust depiction of quality assessment from a consumer perspective. Elements of quality from managerial models, such as product attributes and company image, are found to fit logically into the new structure. The new model also reveals connections with the philosophy and sociology of science and provides an enhanced understanding of the workings of academia and the dissemination of scholarly knowledge. 
 There has previously been no comprehensive study of quality in academic articles, therefore on a practical level the model of quality supports authors in producing improved manuscripts, thus enabling faster review and dissemination of research within the discipline. Further research to refine and test the model is recommended.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">products</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070928.160805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an occupational health and safety surveillance tool for New Zealand workers</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Rebbecca Catherine</field><field name="description">World-wide, working life is undergoing major changes. Established market economies are increasingly characterised by demands for vastly greater market flexibility. New Zealand (NZ) has been no different with rapid changes occurring over the last 2 decades in the organisation of labour, of work and of the work environment. Recent international research suggests that work change significantly impacts upon worker health and safety. 
 Many OECD nations undertake routine cross-sectional surveys to monitor changes in working conditions and environments, assessing the health and safety impact of these changes. Similar monitoring is not undertaken in NZ, with the impact of the work environment on health and injury outcomes poorly understood. This lack of knowledge (monitoring) is considered to be a significant impediment to the progression of health and safety initiatives in NZ. 
 The aim of this thesis was to develop a tool (questionnaire) and methodology suitable for use in the surveillance of working conditions, work environments and health and injury outcomes using workers&#65533; surveys. The survey development was undertaken in 3 phases: i) development of tool through critical review; ii) empirical methodological testing and iii) an empirical validation study. 
 Questionnaire development was a stepwise process of content selection. Firstly key dimensional themes were identified via critical review of literature and existing international surveys leading to the establishment of a dimensional framework. Secondly a critical review of questions to measure key dimensions based upon selection criteria occurred. Finally the selected questions and design were pre-tested before piloting. A similar development process was undertaken for the development of a calendar collecting occupational histories. 
 A methodological study was undertaken piloting the questionnaire. Two methods of data collection were evaluated: face-to-face and telephone interviews, and two methods of occupational history collection: calendar and question set. Telephone interviewing was found to be the more efficient and effective data collection method while occupational history collection was found to be less time consuming by question set. Focus groups indicated questions were acceptable and suitable to NZ workers. 
 A validation study was undertaken with a cross-sectional study in distinctly different occupational groups: cleaners and clerical workers. Comparisons were made between the groups with cleaners expected to be identified as employed under more hazardous working conditions and be exposed to more hazards of a physical nature, while clerical workers were expected to be exposed to more psychological hazards of a psychological nature. Results indicated the questionnaire provides data capable of making valid comparisons, identifying work patterns of high risk and provides good predictive validity. 
 The final survey has the potential to generate population data on a wide range of work-related exposure and health variables relevant to contemporary working life. The survey results will contribute to understanding the range of working conditions and work environments NZ workers are currently exposed to and to assessing the health and safety impact of these exposures. Therefore it is recommended this tool initially be used in a national workforce survey to establish baseline surveillance data of working conditions, work environments and health and safety outcomes in NZ.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="subject">auditing</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071011.112802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and human signal detection</field><field name="creator">Lie, Celia</field><field name="description">Detection and choice research have largely focused on the effects of relative reinforcer frequencies or magnitudes. The effects of punishment have received much less attention. This thesis investigated the effects of punishment on human signal-detection performance using a number of different procedures. These included punisher frequency and magnitude variations, different types of punishers (point loss &amp; time-outs), variations in stimulus disparity, and different detection tasks (judgments of stimulus arrays containing either more blue or red objects, or judgments of statements that were either true or false). It examined whether punishers have similar, but opposite, effects to reinforcers on detection performance, and whether the effects of punishment were successfully captured by existing models of punishment and choice. 
 Experiment 1 varied the relative frequency or magnitude of time-out punishers for errors using the blue/red task. Participants were systematically biased away from the response alternative associated with the higher rate or magnitude of time-out punishers in two of three procedures. Experiment 2 varied the relative frequency of point-loss punishers using the blue/red task and the true/false task. Participants were systematically biased away from the alternative associated with the higher rate of point-loss punishers for the true/false task. 
 Experiment 3 examined the effects of punishment on response bias from a psychophysical perspective. Previous detection research which varied stimulus discriminability while holding reinforcers ratios constant and unequal (Johnstone &amp; Alsop, 2000; McCarthy &amp; Davison, 1984) found that a criterion location measure (e.g., c, Green &amp; Swets, 1966) was a better descriptor of isobias functions compared to a likelihood ratio measure (e.g., log &#946;[G], Green &amp; Swets, 1966). Experiment 3 varied stimulus discriminability while holding punisher ratios constant and unequal. Like previous research, isobias functions were consistent with a criterion location measure. 
 Experiments 4, 5, 6, and 7 examined contemporary models of choice and punishment. Experiments 4, 5, and 6 varied the relative reinforcer ratio in detection tasks, both with and without the inclusion of an equal rate of punishment. Experiment 7 held the reinforcer ratio constant and unequal, and varied the durations of time-out punishers. Increases in preference (for the richer alternative) from reinforcer-only conditions to reinforcer + punisher conditions would support a subtractive model of punishment, while decreases in preference would support an additive model of punishment. 
 Experiment 4 was a between-groups study using time-out punishers. It supported the predictions of an additive model. Experiment 5 used three different procedures in a preliminary within-subjects design, evaluating which procedure was best suited for a larger within-subjects experiment (Experiment 6). In Experiment 6, participants sat four reinforcer-only and four reinforcer + punisher conditions where reinforcers were point-gains and punishers were point-losses. The results from Experiment 6 were mixed - some participants showed increased preference while others showed little change or a slight decrease. This appeared related to the order in which participants received the reinforcer-only and reinforcer + punisher conditions. Experiment 7 also found no consistent change in preference with increases in time-out durations. Instead, there was a slow increase in bias on the richer alternative across the eight sessions. 
 Overall, punishers had similar, but opposite, effects to reinforcers in detection procedures (Experiments 1, 2, &amp; 3). These effects were successfully captured by Davison and Tustin&#65533;s (1978) model of detection. The later experiments did not provide support for a subtractive model punishment model of choice, which had provided the best descriptor in corresponding concurrent-schedule research. Instead, Experiment 4 supported an additive model, and Experiments 5, 6, and 7 provided no evidence for either model - limitations and implications of these studies are discussed. However, the present thesis illustrates that the signal detection procedure is promising for studying the combined effects of reinforcement and punishment, and may offer a worthwhile complement to standard concurrent-schedule choice procedures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">punishment</field><field name="subject">signal</field><field name="subject">detection</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071004.134135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="creator">Panjaworayan, Nattanan</field><field name="description">Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis worldwide. HBV vaccination can prevent new infections, but effective antiviral drugs are not available for a large number of HBV infected patients. To develop novel antiviral drugs, a better understanding of the regulation of HBV gene expression is vital. One important aspect is to understand how HBV hijacks the cellular machinery to export unspliced RNAs from the nucleus of a cell to the site of incorporation into new HBV particles. 
 The HBV post-transcriptional regulatory element (HBV PRE) is a cis acting RNA element found in all HBV transcripts. It has been reported to play an important role in the nuclear export of HBV mRNAs. Moreover, it has the ability to enhance expression of intronless as well as unspliced transcripts. Despite concerted investigations, the functional core element of HBV PRE remains unknown and the exact mechanism of how HBV PRE mediates nuclear export is unclear. 
 This project first produced a complete HBV genome with comprehensive annotation of both coding regions and regulatory signals, which was then used for comparative genomic analysis. The functional elements of the HBV PRE were first subjected to analysis in silico. The HBV PRE is highly conserved among HBVs. Based on this sequence conservation and prediction of conserved RNA secondary structure, potentially functional HBV PRE elements including the previously reported elements (HBV SL&#945; and HBV SL&#946;) were identified. 
 Experimental deletion analysis of the HBV PRE sequence showed that the effect of each of these elements on the intronless reporter gene&#65533;s expression was similar to that of the entire full length HBV PRE. Thus, the results suggested that overall HBV PRE function was not due to additive effects from the individual elements. Surprisingly, a specific sub-section of HBV PRE decreased the level of reporter gene expression. This sub-section has not been identified previously, thus it is a novel HBV PRE inhibitory element. Further analyses using specific reporter assays revealed that the HBV PRE enhanced expression of an unspliced reporter gene whereas the RNA nuclear export elements of retroviruses, CTE (in MPMV) and RRE (in HIV-1) were not able to. Therefore, these results indicate that HBV PRE is involved in inhibition of splicing and it utilizes a different mechanism from CTE and RRE. Interestingly, HBV PRE was observed to be unable to enhance the expression of an intronless luciferase gene. Therefore, HBV PRE is not able to enhance cytoplasmic expression of all intronless transcripts. 
 This project also addressed the idea that the RNA-binding protein, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) is a positive trans-acting factor for HBV PRE function. Transient expression of exogenous PTB in cultured cells showed no specific effect on constructs containing HBV PRE. Moreover, reduction of endogenous PTB by RNAi did not affect HBV PRE function. Therefore, the results presented in this project do not support the hypothesis that PTB plays a role in HBV PRE function. 
 Given that HBV PRE is highly conserved and present in all HBV transcripts, it makes a good target site for novel molecular therapeutic treatments such as siRNA. To identify potential siRNA target sites within HBV PRE, an RNAi study using a plasmid expressing shRNA against HBV PRE was done. The results from the RNAi study revealed that the expression of a reporter gene could be significantly reduced by siRNA targeted to the HBV PRE. 
 Overall, this project produced a highly annotated HBV genome that can be used as the reference sequence for comparative genomic analysis. Moreover, this work identified novel regulatory elements within HBV PRE that are likely to play an important role in HBV gene expression. Furthermore, the study also identified an excellent siRNA target site within HBV PRE that may inhibit HBV gene expression.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hepatitis B</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.143835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unexpected microfungal diversity : woody decay Lasiosphaeriaceae, Chaetosphaeriaceae and Helminthosphaeriaceae of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Toni June</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s lignicolous pyrenomycete flora has been little studied. The cosmopolitan Lasiosphaeriaceae, largest and least studied family in the Sordariales, has long been noted for its morphological diversity and the artificiality of its grouping. This first systematic study of lignicolous Lasiosphaeriaceae in New Zealand uses morphology and phylogenetics to elucidate relationships within the New Zealand mycota and facilitate comparisons with relatives worldwide. Collection areas spanned New Zealand&#65533;s 13 degrees of latitude and included a range of native forest types. The novel application of recently-available molecular biology techniques allowed sequencing from single pyrenomycete fruitbodies. 
 Two new genera and 15 new species or species complexes are proposed in total. A new genus is proposed within the Lasiosphaeriaceae to accommodate an interesting new collection. Seven new species are described in the known genera Lasiosphacria and Lasiosphaeris and the polyphyly of certain Lasiosphacria taxa is discussed. Five new taxa are described within the Chaetosphaeriaceae, including a pair with surprisingly unique morphology. All are currently placed within Chaetosphaeria, but comprise part of a recently recognised long-spored clade that is sister to that which includes the type genus. Within the Helminthosphaeriaceae one new genus is proposed to accommodate an unusual new collection; and a new species described within Hilberina, but its transference to a new genus predicted as knowledge of this recent family grows. Phylogenetic results support the separation of the Chaetosphaeriaceae and Helminthosphaeriaceae from the Lasiosphaeriaceae where many of these taxa were previously. 
 The traditional morphological character of ascospore shape is shown to have little use in the delimitation of genera. More recently emphasised characters such as peridial wall structure may have more value, however the fruitbody wall of some New Zealand taxa could not be more different from their phylogenetic relatives. New Zealand taxa are noted for their frequently unprecedented morphology and/or unique genetics in comparison with other known taxa, which are predominantly from the northern hemisphere. The high levels of morphological and genetic divergence among New Zealand taxa appear to reflect extensive microfungal endemism on these relatively isolated islands; but surveys of diversity in other parts of Gondwana are desperately needed.

In bacteria, the enzyme is used to synthesize ATP when the electrochemical gradient of protons ([Delta][mu]H&#8314;) or sodium ions ([Delta][mu]Na&#8314;) is high, and the phosphorylation potential is low inside the cell. Conversely, the enzyme hydrolyses ATP to generate a [Delta][mu]H&#8314; or [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; when these gradients are low, and the phosphorylation potential is high inside the cell. This is coupled to intracellular pH homeostasis in some fermentative bacteria. The aim of this project was to determine the role(s) of the F[1]F[O]-ATP synthase in the physiology of two anaerobic extremophiles: Clostridium paradoxum, a thermoalkaliphilic bacterium that grows over the pH range 7.5 to 10, and Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium that thrives at neutral to acidic pH. These bacteria represent good models to study membrane-bound energetic processes as a function of pH and temperature. 
 The energetics of C. paradoxum growth was investigated in batch culture. Growth of C. paradoxum was inhibited by the F-type ATP synthase inhibitor N,N&#65533;-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and monensin, suggesting an important role for an F-type ATP synthase and a chemical gradient of sodium ([Delta]pNa&#8314;) in the growth of this bacterium. Protonophores had no effect on the growth of C. paradoxum. Inverted membrane vesicles contained DCCD-sensitive ATPase activity and this activity was extracted using the detergent Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme was purified 30-fold by polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation. The purified enzyme displayed the typical subunit pattern for an F[1]F[O]-ATP synthase, but also included the presence of a stable oligomeric c-ring that could be dissociated by trichloroacetic acid treatment into its monomeric c subunits. The c-ring was purified, crystallized in 2D, and the projection map indicated that C. paradoxum contains an undecameric c-ring. The purified ATPase was stimulated by Na&#8314; ions, and sodium provided protection against inhibition by DCCD that was pH-dependent. ATP synthesis in inverted membrane vesicles was driven by an artificially imposed [Delta]pNa&#8314; in the presence of a transmembrane electrical potential ([Delta][phi]) and was sensitive to monensin. Cloning and sequencing of the atp operon revealed the presence of a sodium-binding motif in the membrane-bound c subunit (viz., Q&#65533;&#8312;, E&#8310;&#65533;, and S&#8310;&#65533;). On the basis of these properties, the ATPase is a sodium-translocating enzyme that generates a [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; that could be used to drive other membrane-bound bioenergetic processes (e.g., solute transport or flagellar rotation). In support of this proposal are the low rates of ATP synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme and the lack of the C-terminal region of the [epsilon] subunit that has been shown to be essential for coupled ATP synthesis. To facilitate future work on this enzyme at a molecular level, we developed a heterologous over-expression/production system to produce the ATPase in E. coli DK8 ([Delta]unc) in the presence of the helper plasmid pLysRARE. In future studies, this system will be used for the purification of mutant enzyme complexes. 
 Thermotoga maritima is an anaerobic hyperthermophilic bacterium that grows at 80&#65533;C and pH 7.0. Growth is sensitive to DCCD and monensin, but resistant to protonophores. These data suggest a [Delta]pNa&#8314; is indispensable for growth and a F-type ATP synthase plays an important role under these conditions. The ATPase activity was extracted from inverted membrane vesicles using the detergent n-dodecyl &#946;-D-maltoside. To investigate the role of the ATPase, the enzyme complex was purified 13-fold by polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation, anionic exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The purified enzyme was stimulated in the presence of low concentrations of Na&#8314; ions, and ATP-dependent uptake of &#65533;&#65533;Na&#8314; into inverted membrane vesicles was observed to be sensitive to DCCD and monensin. Furthermore, analysis of the published genome sequence revealed the presence of a sodium-binding motif in the membrane-bound c subunit (viz., E&#65533;&#65533;, E&#8310;&#8309; and T&#8310;&#8310;) and analysis of the ATPase by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a putative SDS-stable c-ring. On the basis of these properties, the ATPase from T. maritima appears to be a sodium-translocating enzyme. While we were unable to establish a physiological role for the ATPase, we propose that the enzyme generates a [Delta][mu]Na&#8314; that could be used to drive other membrane-bound bioenergetic processes (e.g., solute transport or flagellar rotation). To improve purification and yield, the atp operon was cloned to allow the heterologous over-production of the ATPase. No expression of the ATPase (F[1]F[O]) could be achieved in E. coli BL21(DE3)-CodonPlus, C41(DE3) or E. coli DK8 ([Delta]unc). However, the overproduction of the F&#8321;-ATPase utilizing the helper plasmid pLysRARE was succesful and the enzyme was purified 18-fold by heat precipitation, followed by anionic exchange and gel filtration chromatography, yielding a specific activity of 2.5 U/mg. This complex will be used in the future to investigate the biochemical properties of an F&#8321;-ATPase from a hyperthermophilic anaerobe.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080207.135137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cruising with containers : a qualitative investigation of the lived experience of passenger freighter travel</field><field name="creator">Szarycz, Gregory Simon</field><field name="description">This thesis is the result of a preliminary investigation into a niche market segment of the maritime tourism economy. Travel by working class freighter or cargo ship is not a new activity; however, the concept of freighter-based tourism (wherein participants travel by container ship in their free time solely for leisure purposes) has emerged relatively recently on the tourism spectrum. A major cause of its recent popularity and allied growth is the positive word of mouth promotion which has been generated by people who try freighter cruising and like it. As the number of prospective travellers increases, merchant shipping lines are seeing dramatic changes in the makeup of their passenger lists. In former years, the typical freighter 'passenger' spanned all ages and walks of life, as thousands of European immigrants traversed the Atlantic in search of a new life in the Americas. Today&#65533;s freighter 'travellers' are almost always over 50 years of age (up to a maximum age of 79) and are, for the most part, affluent with time and money to spare. Freighter travel nowadays involves the movement of people solely for the purpose of a unique and atypical travel experience. 
 The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of 22 participants engaged in recreational travel aboard working container vessels/cargo ships. The research questions driving this study were: What expectations and factors are understood by passengers to influence their decision to choose this particular mode of transport? What is the nature of the freighter experience, as passengers themselves understand it? What meanings do passengers attach to their experiences? How do the temporal dimensions of the passenger freighter experience (before, during, and after) connect with each other? 
 This study employed a qualitative methodology to capture and portray as vividly as possible the participants&#65533; experiences and their attempts to make sense of those experiences. A phenomenological case study research design, set within a symbolic interactionist analytical framework, guided the study. The data consisted of in-depth online interviews and document analysis in the form of unsolicited travelogues/journey diaries. Through a prolonged and iterative process of data analysis using the transcendental phenomenological model provided by Moustakas (1994) and the operational refinements suggested by Schutz (1970) and Kvale (1995), the researcher documented the 'lived experience' of travel by cargo ship from the individual travellers&#65533; perspectives. Further, as a tool for describing, analysing, and interpreting the data, this study utilised the 'generic social processes scheme', a sociological method for the purposes of organising, analysing and interpreting qualitative data (Prus 1996). Within this research the themes were presented collectively, although they were systematically identified separately. 
 The shared themes, meanings and patterns that shaped the informants&#65533; travel narratives suggested that moving out to the unfamiliar can be frightening, or it can be liberating. Participants had assessed and realistically accepted the potential hazards of a freighter voyage, working on the assumption that a willingness to roll with uncertainty, unexpected delays, and mishaps is mandatory. Associated with these themes were issues of adaptation; dealing with challenges, ambiguities and constraints, which, despite their potential to preclude further similar such involvements, shaped the overall freighter travel experience and did not affect participants&#65533; satisfaction with the experience. 
 It was further shown that freighter travellers are highly individualised people characterised by their interest in unique 'life experiences' and defined by their search for the 'extraordinary'. Participants framed their behaviours as an extension of themselves; their self-designation as 'travellers' and not 'tourists' and their emphasis on independence and autonomy conferred a sense of individuality and personal determination. Like Cohen&#65533;s (1976) non-institutionalised, unstructured tourists, these 'travellers' valued risk, adventure and novelty. 
 The idea of negotiation through ambiguity and occasional setbacks in their travels further challenges commonly held perceptions about constraints, which, too often is seems, have been construed as obstacles or barriers (Jackson 2000) to travel. With regard to the present study, constraints, while inherent to freighter travel, would not have represented a full or accurate picture of the travellers&#65533; experiences without a concomitant description of how they were negotiated; moreover, the process of their negotiation repositions these travellers as active participants (instead of inactive consumers) of the tourist experience. These travellers decided what they wanted to do, where they wanted to go, and ensured they could negotiate their constraints to do so. 
 The conclusive findings of this study suggest that freighter travel was viewed largely as a positive, beneficial, and rewarding experience, offering opportunities for self-development, reflection, social interaction, and cross-cultural immersion and learning. While certain constraints and limitations were acknowledged and recognised, freighter travellers negotiated through them, and fully enjoyed participation in the travel experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocean</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">cargo</field><field name="subject">ships</field><field name="subject">passenger</field><field name="subject">traffic</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080208.140410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#65533;s use of platonic and neoplatonic theories of evil and creation</field><field name="creator">McLean, Karen</field><field name="description">Samuel Taylor Coleridge used theories of evil and creation from Plato, Plotinus and Proclus to refine his definitions of the Trinity and the Absolute and Apostate Wills, and to move beyond the Germanic Naturphilosophie concept of self-hood as achieved by a self-objectification which emphasised differences between the persons of the Trinity rather than their similarities. His use of specific classical Greek concepts allowed him to propose that the Absolute Will&#65533;s self-substantiative act established unity and distinction as simultaneous and interrelated equals. From this, Coleridge investigated how identity and relationship rely upon unity and distinction, as he believed that identity is a unified self distinct from others, and that relationship is the unified common ground of many selves. 
 My first chapter explains my methodology in dealing with Coleridge&#65533;s problematic relationship with both Greek and German sources, and describes how Coleridge&#65533;s philosophical investigations into evil and creation resulted from personal crises oyer his sense of self and sin. I provide an overview of the system Coleridge devised to address these concerns, concentrating upon the aspects which he believed clarified humanity&#65533;s status in relation to evil and the divine. I demonstrate how Coleridge accounts for the origin of the Apostate Will, and I explain his view of identity and relationships between the persons of the Trinity, providing a relevant overview that allows me to point out his use of the fundamental Greek concepts that anchor the subsequent chapters on Plato, Plotinus and Proclus. 
 My second chapter examines Coleridge&#65533;s statement that Plato had formulated a triune creative principle, a concept critical to Coleridge&#65533;s need to unite God to the created universe. After describing the Platonic structure of reality and its divine creative act, I focus on the Platonic triad of Difference, Unity and Being. Plato&#65533;s account of these three principles and how they arise from the divine principle activity influences Coleridge&#65533;s view of the Trinity, what it contains in terms of distinction and unity, and how the Trinity arises from the superessential Absolute Will. I explain how Coleridge refined his definition of Christ as pleroma by referencing the way that the Form of the Good simultaneously exhibits plurality and identity. 
 My third chapter shows how the Plotinian theory of the One&#65533;s will-based self-substantiation influenced Coleridge&#65533;s definition of the Absolute Will. I determine that Plotinus&#65533;s concept of heterotes (otherness) informs Coleridge&#65533;s view of the origin of evil, and I show how his concept of redemption is influenced by Plotinus&#65533;s account of noetic contemplation. 
 My fourth chapter explains how Coleridge used the Proclian concept of Bound to develop the actualising quality of the Logos, in relation to Christ as a successful plurality but also in terms of Christ&#65533;s role in the redemption. 
 My conclusion surveys all four philosophers to demonstrate how concepts drawn from Plato, Plotinus and Proclus helped Coleridge to define the Absolute Will and the way that its activity is the unity, distinction, identity and relationship of the Trinity. These three distinct yet related systems influenced Coleridge&#65533;s view of evil, as well as his understanding of the Absolute Will&#65533;s self-creative act, its relation to the Trinity, and the simultaneously fallen and divine status of humanity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">Plato</field><field name="subject">influence</field><field name="subject">ancient philosophy</field><field name="subject">neoplatonism</field><field name="subject">good</field><field name="subject">evil</field><field name="subject">creation</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080222.121810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contesting natures : a discourse analysis of natural resource conflicts</field><field name="creator">Walton, Sara</field><field name="description">This research explores the discursive formations involved in two environmental conflicts during which organisations were not permitted to carry out their proposed extractive activities. The conflicts were based on the West Coast of the South Island in New Zealand. The first involved sustainable native logging and the second was over the siting and extension of a gold mine. 
 Extensive archival and media searches were carried out to generate data on the conflicts. Interviews were also conducted to investigate the community position in more depth. The discourse theory of Laclau and Mouffe (2001 [1985]) is drawn upon as a framework to make sense of the conflicts. This framework was particularly useful as it enabled a close and careful examination of the antagonisms and addressed some of the ideological and power concerns with stakeholder analysis. The analysis involved identifying nodal points, subjectivity, subject positions and floating signifiers, which enabled certain hegemonic constructions. 
 The two conflicts were considerably different. The hegemonic constructions were quite similar and the notion of &#65533;being green&#65533; emerged as an antagonism that was at the heart of the conflicts and a key to understanding why these business organisations were unsuccessful. That is, who or what is given meaning as &#65533;being green&#65533; negates and de-legitimates other activity that is not deemed to be green. In these conflicts business organisations extracting natural resources and subjects supporting these organisational activities could not be green - when being green was constituted in terms of the clean green discourse operating economically and socially within New Zealand (see Bell, 1996). Consequently, not being green was deemed to be outside of what we see as New Zealanders as being important and thus should not occur in this country. 
 This research has implications for business organisations in New Zealand dealing with greening issues, especially as external stakeholders can have considerable influence on organisational activities. Theoretically it argues for a discursive approach to organisational stakeholder analysis in order to address power and subjectivity and for the organisation and natural environment literature to recognise the possibility of multiple meanings of nature. In particular, this thesis contributes to current organisation studies literature by explicitly focusing on &#65533;nature&#65533; as a concept. It shows that the meaning attributed to nature is a political process which can have consequences for preventing or enabling significant business organisational activities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Grey District</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">forests</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.142212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and molecular characterisation of bacitracin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis</field><field name="creator">Gauntlett, Jonathan C</field><field name="description">Resistance to the antibiotic bacitracin in Enterococcus faecalis strain AR01/DGVS is conferred by the genes bcrABD that are under the control of the regulatory protein BcrR. The N-terminal domain of BcrR has similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins and topological modelling predicts that the C-terminal domain contains four transmembrane &#945;-helices. These data have led to the hypothesis that BcrR is a novel transmembrane transcriptional regulator which acts to both sense bacitracin and initiate transcription of bcrABD. The transcription of bcrABD in the presence of bacitracin results in the expression of a putative ABC transporter, BcrAB, that may function by the efflux of bacitracin from the cell membrane. 
 The aim of this study was to further characterise the mechanism of bacitracin resistance in E. faecalis and to conduct structural and functional studies with BcrR. A series of bcrA-lacZ transcriptional fusions were created to investigate the regulation of bcrABD transcription by BcrR and map the bcrABD promoter. We determined that BcrR activates bcrA-lacZ expression in response to bacitracin directly and not indirectly via the build-up of cell wall stress or cell wall precursors. A 69-bp region of the bcrABD promoter was required for activation of bcrA-lacZ expression. The introduction of mutations into this sequence demonstrated that two inverted repeat regions (viz. 5&#65533;-CTGACA(N)&#8326;GTGTC-3&#65533;) were required for bcrA-lacZ expression. Furthermore, the creation of a bcrR::kan insertion mutant and a bcrR-lacZ transcriptional fusion revealed that bcrR is required for high-level bacitracin resistance in AR01/DGVS and that BcrR does not act to auto-regulate bcrR-lacZ expression. 
 To study BcrR function, we overproduced BcrR with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in Escherichia coli membranes, extracted the protein with n-dodecyl-&#946;-D-maltoside, and subsequently purified it via Ni&#65533;&#8314;-NTA affinity and gel filtration chromatography to apparent homogeneity. Purified BcrR was reconstituted into liposomes and BcrR binding to bcrABD promoter DNA was analysed using gel-shift assays. We demonstrated that BcrR binds the bcrABD promoter in both the absence and presence of Zn&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin and that the presence of the inverted repeat regions is necessary for binding. Purification of BcrR has also enabled us to commence structural studies toward obtaining the three dimensional structure of BcrR. We obtained crystals of BcrR that diffracted poorly to a resolution of 19 A&#778;. 
 To characterise the function of the putative ABC type transporter (exporter) of bacitracin, BcrAB, we conducted transport assays with purified bacitracin A, fluorescently labelled FITC-bacitracin A, and radioactive &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin. Transport assays conducted with radioactive &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin and inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli, in which BcrABD had been recombinantly overproduced, displayed uptake of &#8310;&#65533;Ni&#65533;&#8314;-bacitracin, suggesting that BcrAB functions as a transporter of bacitracin. 
 We conclude that BcrR is a transmembrane DNA-binding protein that functions as both a bacitracin sensor and regulator of bcrABD expression. We propose that BcrR binds to inverted repeat regions in bcrABD promoter to regulate bcrABD expression. Expression of bcrABD results in the production of BcrAB, which appears to be capable of bacitracin efflux (i.e. uptake in inverted membrane vesicles), conferring high-level bacitracin resistance to E. faecalis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterococcus faecalis</field><field name="subject">bacitracin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.143509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geographical vector agents</field><field name="creator">Hammam, Yasser</field><field name="description">Simulating geographic phenomena in a realistic and plausible way requires real-world entities to be abstracted based on the dynamic physical characteristics they exhibit, and treated as individuals in a simulation domain. These processes cannot be adequately supported by the traditional spatial model based on cellular-space such as Cellular Automata (CA). Although this approach has received a great attention as a most favoured technique for simulating the geographic phenomena from different aspects, the need for a generic spatial model to overcome the limitations encountered in such an approach has been raised. This applies particularly to the way real-world entities are represented in a simulation domain regarding their physical characteristics and temporal aspects. 
 In this thesis, a new computational approach for a spatial model suitable for simulating geographic phenomena is presented: the vector agents model. The vector agent is goal-oriented, adaptable, physically defined by an Euclidean geometry and able to change its own geometric characteristics while interacting with other agents in its neighbourhood using a set of rules. The agent is modelled with sensor, state, and strategies. The successful implementation of the model&#65533;s architecture allows the representation of the physical characteristics of real-world entities and to observe their complex and dynamic behaviour in a simulation domain. Vector agents have developed out of a need to create a systematic basis for the geometric components of Geographic Automata Systems (GAS), as outlined by Torrens and Benenson (2005). 
 A generic vector agents model was built, then tested and validated from different aspects, from which results demonstrated the model&#65533;s efficiency. It is confirmed that vector agents are flexible in producing different complex shapes and patterns for recreating real geographic phenomena through the generic use of three algorithms of geometric manipulation: midpoint displacement by using the relaxed Brownian Motion (fractal-like) algorithm, edge displacement and vertex displacement. The effectiveness of this was initially ascertained visually. A simple heuristic to govern shape growth rate and complexity was derived based on the interplay of the three algorithms. There was a further abstract model comparison against the cellular-agents environment, with the result that vector agents have the ability to emerge patterns similar to what can be produced by cellular-agents with the advantage of representing entities as individuals with their own attributes with realistic geometric boundaries. On the other hand, the city as a complex geographic phenomenon was used as a specific domain for validating the model with a real-world system. The results of the urban land use simulations (driven by simple rules based on three classical urban theories) confirmed that: (a) the model is flexible enough to incorporate various external rules based on real-world systems and (b) the model has a sufficient capability in emerging a variety of patterns under several environments close to actual patterns. The agent environment also proved to be an effective way of easily combining the rules associated with each urban theory (different agents behaved according to different theories). Finally, limitations raised through the development of this work are addressed leading to outline possible extensions of both model computation and the domain of applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">cellular automata</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.150839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of enterprise systems : a process view</field><field name="creator">Madhavan, Thiruvenkatachari</field><field name="description">During the 1990s, many organizations across the globe migrated existing information systems to Enterprise Systems (ES) packages, which promised both business and technical solutions to their existing sets of problems. However, ES implementations have gained notoriety for not meeting budgeted expenditures and schedules. Such events have warranted academic research to gain an understanding about the role of ES packages and the importance of ES implementation. A large number of academic researchers have adopted a variance approach to examine ES implementation. As a result they have identified a range of critical success factors said to be influential in achieving successful implementation of ES packages. An alternate perspective for researching ES implementation is the process approach but this has remained largely neglected in academic debates. Furthermore, it has still not been possible for researchers or practitioners to understand the degree to which specific critical success factors, or other considerations, might be influential in any given ES implementation, either pre- or post-project. 
 This research therefore adopts the process approach to examine ES implementations. The process approach is focused on explaining an outcome, given a set of activities. This research draws upon the work of Markus and Tanis (2000) and O&#65533;Leary (2000), who have established frameworks to explain an outcome (success or failure) of ES implementations. In addition, this research draws on the work of Davenport (2000) and Brehm et al. (2001), who have established models that outline activities related to configuration of business and software processes during implementation of ES packages. To enable this inquiry, a single case study (site) was chosen, to expose the actions and events that transpired during the implementation of an ES package. 
 This research concludes that the framework of O&#65533;Leary (2000) is better suited to explain the outcome of an ES Implementation than the framework of Markus and Tanis (2000). The framework of Markus and Tanis (2000) was found to be useful in understanding the implementation process of an ES package. 
 In addition, this research developed a novel model that portrays a comprehensive set of activities, undertaken by the case organization during the configuration of business and software processes. This model traversed the 'High-Level', 'Detailed Development' and 'Implementation' stages of the configuration process. It is asserted that this model is a significant improvement when compared to models presented by Davenport (2000) and Brehm et al. (2001). This research also explored some of the issues of the case study that did not fit neatly into the existing theoretic frameworks employed. 
 Six issues emerged in this regard; 'Selection of industry specific ES package solution'; 'Selection of Proven Implementation Partner'; 'Project Planning and Management'; 'Incremental Implementation Strategy'; 'Ownership of the ES Project' and 'Selection of Best Practice Business Processes'. It is contended that each have played a critical role in the successful deployment of the ES package at this case site.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">storage</field><field name="subject">retrieval</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">equipment</field><field name="subject">supplies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080414.160905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Definitions of obedience in Paradise regained</field><field name="creator">Learmonth, Nicola K</field><field name="description">The thesis has two parts. Part One surveys the debate on how to define Christian obedience and Milton&#65533;s prose contributions to that discourse. In the century leading up to Milton&#65533;s prose writings there was much debate in England over how to define spiritual obedience. Civil authorities argued that matters of religion fell within state jurisdiction and that an individual&#65533;s spiritual obedience should be subject to outward scrutiny and external control; but these definitions were contested by Protestant reformers. Chapter One traces the issue up to Milton&#65533;s contributions. 
 Chapter Two traces Milton&#65533;s thinking about obedience, spiritual and secular, through his own prose writings: Milton defines obedience as a responsible freedom which requires continual critical assessment of authority. In reaction to the political and ecclesiastical developments of his own time, Milton places increasing emphasis on the role of the individual in defining and expressing obedience to God by means of scriptural study and open discussion. Milton argues that liberty is a necessary pre-condition for giving true obedience to God, and this idea comes to the fore in the later prose tracts, which respond to political and ecclesiastical developments that Milton interpreted as threatening the individual&#65533;s liberty of conscience. 
 Part Two examines Paradise Regained (1671), in which Milton advances his interpretation of obedience through his characterisation of the Son of God. Chapter Three shows how Milton links those forms of Christian obedience which he rejects in his prose writing to either Satan or satanic influence. Through his depiction of the Son&#65533;s responses to Satan, Milton indicates that Satan&#65533;s versions of obedience are designed to distract the Son, and any other believer, from giving proper obedience to God. 
 Chapter Four traces how Milton&#65533;s depiction of the Son of God demonstrates his understanding of the right reasons for, and ways of, giving proper obedience to God. The Son&#65533;s firm obedience is a state of mind and comprises knowledge of God through scriptural study, conversation and meditation. This exemplary obedience is motivated by an appreciation for and desire to participate in God&#65533;s glory (ie., Creation), and Milton indicates that it is this appreciation of divine glory that enables the Son of God to successfully resist Satan&#65533;s temptations. 
 Chapter Five examines Milton&#65533;s final episode, the pinnacle temptation, in terms of the obedience which he has approved throughout the poem. This chapter addresses Milton&#65533;s handling of the reader&#65533;s expectations for this scene, and the symbolic language and setting of the pinnacle episode. Unlike any other writers on the temptations in the wilderness, Milton invests the Son&#65533;s victory (and Satan&#65533;s defeat) on the pinnacle with symbolic power by depicting the Son standing in firm obedience to God. Thus Milton presents his reader with the definitive expression of humanity&#65533;s obedience to God: the Son&#65533;s stand is a symbolic return to the "Godlike erect" stance ascribed to prelapsarian humanity in Paradise Lost (PL, IV.289), and with this firm, upright obedience Milton shows the rest of humanity how to regain Paradise.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">John Milton (1608-1674)</field><field name="subject">Paradise regained</field><field name="subject">obedience</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">christianity</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">Son of God</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071108.162331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of inheritance? : the language of inheritance in Romans within its first-century Greco-Roman Imperial context</field><field name="creator">Forman, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the extent to which Paul&#65533;s terminology of Inheritance [(...)] in Romans, and its associated imagery, logic and arguments, functioned to evoke socio-political expectations that were alternative to those which prevailed in contemporary Roman imperial discourse. 
 There are two parts to this study. The first is to take seriously the context of Empire and the claims being made by the Roman Empire in the first century. In particular, what were some of the messages conveyed by the Roman Empire with regard to the structure and purpose, the hopes and expectations, of first-century society? The Christians in Rome were daily exposed to the images and message of Caesar and his successors and there is therefore a need to consider how Paul&#65533;s language of Inheritance would have sounded within this environment. 
 Second, this study gives attention to the content of Paul&#65533;s use of the word "inheritance" as it occurs in Romans. In order to address this question, three interrelated ideas are explored. First, for Paul, what does the inheritance consist of? The traditional understanding is that the concept is an entirely spiritualised or transcendent reality. This study proposes a more this-worldly, geographical nature to the word. Second, there is the closely related question of the political nature of inheritance. If it is the case that the language of inheritance has to do with the renewal of the land, then who inherits this land? These two questions raise a third issue-how will the inheritance transpire? Paul&#65533;s inheritance language contributes to notions of lordship, authority and universal sovereignty for the people of God. Conceivably, the path to this dominion could mirror the hegemonic intentions of imperial Rome which envisages the triumph of one group of people (the strong) over another (the weak). Is this the case with Paul&#65533;s inheritance language, or does it somehow undermine all claims to power and control? 
 There are five undisputed uses of [...] and its cognates in Romans-Rom 4:13, 14; Rom 8:17 (three times) and there is one textual variant in Rom 11:1 where the word [...] is used in place of [...]. This study finds that, to varying degrees in each of these texts, the inheritance concept is not only a direct confrontation to other claims to rule, it is also simultaneously a reversal of all other paths to lordship and rule. 
 This study then considers the use of the concept in the two other undisputed Pauline letters where it occurs (Galatians and 1 Corinthians) and also in the disputed letter to the Colossians. The overriding impression is that there is nothing in Galatians, 1 Corinthians or Colossians which significantly challenges the this-worldly, political nature of the language of inheritance in Romans. In these epistles and in Romans Paul employs the language and politics of inheritance in order to subvert the message of Empire.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">Romans</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">style</field><field name="subject">Epistles of Paul</field><field name="subject">emperor worship</field><field name="subject">Rome</field><field name="subject">legitimacy of governments</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080128.161919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid forces on an accelerating hand in swimming</field><field name="creator">Kudo, Shigetada</field><field name="description">This study examines the effects of acceleration on fluid forces acting on the hand in swimming and presents a new pressure method to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand. 
 Swimmers and coaches require accurate information about swimmers&#65533; fluid forces, propulsion and drag, in order to improve performance. In general, swimmers are likely to generate propulsion mainly with their hands in the front crawl stroke, butterfly and back crawl stroke. Researchers have attempted to estimate the fluid forces on the hands with various techniques including a cinematographic method (a "quasi-static" approach), a pressure method and a numerical method of computational fluid dynamics. However, the effect of accelerations on fluid forces acting on the hand has not yet been well quantified. Understanding of the effect of acceleration on fluid forces on the hand can provide useful information to enhance swimming performance. Also the developments of a method to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand in swimming can be used to evaluate swimming performance more accurately. The present study used a hand model attached to a load cell to measure forces in three orthogonal directions and pressure sensors to measure pressures on the hand model rotated in the flume. The model position was measured by a potentiometer fixed to the axis of the model rotation. 
 The quantification of the effect of acceleration was based on a simple theoretical understanding for fluid mechanics, using the inertia coefficients and the coefficients of fluid forces, that is widely accepted in other disciplines. The quantification was focused mainly in the direction tangential to the model rotation because the magnitude of the velocity changed in this direction. The overall effect of acceleration on fluid forces on the hand model was that the inertia coefficients increased rapidly in the early phase of the model movement, then in the final deceleration phase of model movement the inertia coefficients decreased to a negative value and then became small. The inertia coefficient increased in the impulsive start of the hand model, indicating that fluid forces acting on the hand increased as accelerations of the hand increased. This result was consistent with the simple theoretical understanding to induce additional fluid forces on the hand, that is, fluid forces on the hand increased as accelerations increased. However, the inertia coefficient decreased and reached large negative values in the late phase of the model movement involving decelerated motion, indicating that fluid forces on the hand increased as acceleration of the hand decreased to negative values (decelerations). That result was not consistent with the simple theoretical understanding to induce additional fluid forces on the hand because the simple theoretical understanding cannot take account of the preceding history of the fluid motion around the hand model associated with the formation of vortices. Thus, more sophisticated theory is needed. The dynamic pressure measured by the pressure sensors implied that the induced fluid forces might be due to large attached vortices behind the hand model. 
 The hand was considered as a blunt body when the angle of attack was large (maximum = 90&#65533;) and an aerofoil shape when the angle of attack was small. The inertia coefficients became large when the hand model was set at the large angles of attack, indicating that the effect of accelerations on the hand model increased when the hand surface was directed to the on-coming flows (blunt body). 
 For the development of the new pressure method, a regression analysis was used to build a single best-fit equation to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand model. The single best-fit equation was acquired for various orientations of the hand model. The accuracy of prediction of fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand model was checked by a root mean square (RMS) difference. The RMS difference by the pressure method was approximately half of the RMS difference by the "quasi-static" approach that has been a major method to predict fluid forces exerted by the hand in swimming. 
 The present study has quantified the effect of acceleration on fluid forces acting on the hand in swimming and developed a new pressure method including acceleration effects to predict fluid forces acting on the accelerating hand.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swimming</field><field name="subject">hand</field><field name="subject">movements</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">acceleration</field><field name="subject">mechanics</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080121.120957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic contributors to congenital joint dislocation</field><field name="creator">Bicknell, Louise Susan</field><field name="description">Understanding the molecular basis of Mendelian disorders featuring joint dislocation can enhance the knowledge of genetic or cellular pathways required in joint development, and provide candidate genes for studying related complex disorders, such as developmental dysplasia of the hip. Two strategies were employed in this project to investigate Mendelian contributors to congenital joint dislocation. 
 The first strategy was to investigate in-depth a gene known to be associated with joint dislocation. Missense mutations or small in-frame deletions in FLNB, encoding filamin B, have previously been associated with a spectrum of osteochondrodysplasias. Screening a larger cohort established FLNB as the sole underlying disease gene for atelosteogenesis type I and III and also boomerang dysplasia, which was previously thought clinically to be allelic to AOI. Mutations in FLNB cause a large proportion of Larsen syndrome cases with phenotypes reminiscent of the early case series reported. Atypical or "recessive" Larsen syndrome may therefore be due to a different underlying genetic aberration. The disease-associated amino acid substitutions or in-frame deletion/insertions cluster to two main regions of the filamin B protein: the calponin homology 2 domain of the actin-binding domain, and repeats 13-17 of the rod domain. To analyse the functions of these regions, yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed. No interactors were identified with the calponin homology 2 domain, which suggests the amino acid substitutions may disrupt actin binding or the regulation thereof. A candidate interactor, centromere protein J, was identified that binds to repeats 13-15, and could suggest a model for aberrant cell division seen in growth plates of bones of individuals with atelosteogenesis types I and III and boomerang dysplasia. 
 The second strategy used in this project was to investigate the genetic cause of a novel syndrome featuring joint dislocation. A neurocutaneous phenotype segregated in a consanguineous New Zealand family, and through a genetic mapping strategy, a significantly linked locus was identified at 10q23 (Z = 3.63), in which segregation of a common ancestral haplotype fits the linkage hypothesis of homozygosity by descent. Candidate gene analysis and subsequent screening identified a missense mutation 2350C&gt;T in ALDH18A1, which predicts the substitution H784Y in the encoded protein [Delta]&#65533;-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS). The known function of P5CS in proline and ornithine biosynthesis was not affected by the presence of H784Y in an indirect assay, and therefore the hypothesis proposed was that a novel, unknown moonlighting function of P5CS is perturbed causing the phenotype segregating in the family. As an initial exploration of functions of P5CS in the cell, yeast two-hybrid analysis was undertaken. 
 This project examined the contribution of two genes, FLNB and ALDH18A1, to Mendelian congenital joint dislocations. How the cellular functions of the encoded proteins in the cytoskeleton, metabolism, or signal transduction, are critical for joint development is ill understood. Future investigations aimed at identifying candidate genes that confer susceptibility to developmental dysplasia of the hip should consider candidate genes that encode proteins related in function to the products of the FLNB and ALDH18A1 genes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dislocations</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">hip joint</field><field name="subject">congenital dislocation</field><field name="subject">human abnormalities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.151359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supranational governance of tourism : aid, trade and power relations between the European Union and the South Pacific island states</field><field name="creator">Schilcher, Daniela</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the role of supranational organisations (SOs) in the governance of tourism in a North-South context. Focusing on the issue area of development cooperation, this thesis investigated the question of how and why SOs got involved in tourism in developing countries, and more specifically, in small island developing states. Such involvement may occur either directly through aid funded projects or indirectly through international trade regimes that impact on tourism in the aid recipient countries. The thesis adopted a case study approach focussing on the European Union&#65533;s (EU&#65533;s) involvement in the governance of tourism in South Pacific island states. Grounded in a history of colonialism, the EU has been involved in the &#65533;development&#65533; of the South Pacific for more than three decades, which allowed to track changes in development philosophy over time. Focusing on the concept of power, the case was assessed in a multi-scalar manner, analysing the EU&#65533;s involvement from the global down to the local level. Never before has an entire multilevel polity been assessed in one coherent case study, incorporating actors situated at all levels and ranging from supranational organisations to national governments, businesses, communities, and individuals. 
 The methods employed in this thesis included interviews, participant observation, document analysis (policy documents and newspapers), and subsequently critical discourse analysis. The latter served to highlight the so-called &#65533;third face of power&#65533; (Lukes 1974), which is closely related to the concept of ideological hegemony. Interviews were conducted in Fiji and Samoa with officials of the South Pacific Delegations of the EU, officials of tourism authorities, NGOs, tourism operators and community members. Elite interviews in Brussels were conducted with officials of the European Commission and the European Parliament. 
 Under all scales and &#65533;faces&#65533; of power the EU was found to be the dominant actor, while the issue of self-interest appeared to play a key role. At a macro-level, the EU clearly dominated in most overt decision-making situations during negotiations on aid and trade agreements. As concerned the inclusion of tourism in the agreements, the relative importance of the sector was clearly dependent on the European Commission&#65533;s prevailing attitude on &#65533;tourism and development&#65533; at any point in time. At a meso- and micro-level, the EU&#65533;s influence was less obvious yet nonetheless existent, for example through funding rules and the use of European consultants. Indirect influence also occurred at the national level. In particular the substitution of a preferential trade regime with a free trade agreement (the Economic Partnership Agreements), which is currently being negotiated between the EU and the Pacific Islands, is likely to have a significant impact on the economic importance of tourism, as well as public policy in the South Pacific. In a mini case study of Samoa, it was found that the resulting changes in tourism policy would have a significant impact &#65533;on the ground&#65533;, in particular with regard to rates of local ownership and control. 
 Overall, power relations were found to be highly unequal and self-determination and empowerment have largely not been achieved. However, more research is needed to examine the ability to generalise the findings to other geographic regions or other types of SOs. The key contribution of this thesis in the theoretical realm constitutes its bridging of agency and structure within multi-level governance, which may be conceived as a &#65533;third way&#65533; to either dependency theory-influenced studies (global/structure) or community approaches (local/agency).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Pacific area</field><field name="subject">developing countries</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080508.150955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the willingness to pay in the context of communal land values : the case of backpackers in Fiji</field><field name="creator">Tokalau, Filipo</field><field name="description">Communal land values can, on the one hand, be an integral part of the socio-cultural experience which tourists seek and enjoy while visiting Fiji. Partly inherited from the land, such values are still vital as basis of survival in rural Fiji. They are passive so they do not command a price and therefore largely considered free however, indigenous Fijian landowners tend to perceive that such values are an inseparable part of their land and may often expect that these ought to be paid for when land is taken up for development such as in tourism. This dilemma within the tourism system could underpin land conflicts between traditional landowners and tourism entrepreneurs. As tourists ultimately bear costs, the problem can be partially addressed by focusing on their willingness to pay for communal use of land. 
 This research assesses the backpackers&#65533; willingness to pay (WTP) for communal values of land in Fiji, including their opinions, feelings, attitudes and perceptions. It uses a social, psychological-economic theoretical framework which postulates firstly, that backpackers will pay in order to maximise satisfaction and, that utilities from passive values can be derived and measured. Secondly, as backpackers search for authenticity, adventure and meeting local people they would tend to be self actualised and therefore willing to pay. A contingent valuation study was undertaken in Fiji from February to June 2003 with a relatively high participation and response rate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from February to March, 2005 to elicit backpackers&#65533; knowledge, feelings, perceptions and attitudes regarding their willingness to pay for the communal use of land. 
 A great majority of respondents were willing to pay. CV respondents were willing to pay an average of F$6.50 for the communal value of land but the younger, highly educated and long haulers would pay less. Though a high proportion of respondents were willing to pay because they valued the communal use of land, for the majority the main reason was financial. Interviewees were willing to pay for economic, psychological and egocentric reasons. The latter two were particularly based on their motivational satisfaction and understanding of the traditional land-based survival skills. Respondents&#65533; perceptions of communal values of land, incomes and psychological attitude were also major factors underlying why they were not willing to pay. 
 In light of the study&#65533;s findings, it was suggested that the backpacker concept may need to be re-examined as they tended not to be necessarily as budget-minded and exploitative as generally depicted to be. Similarly, they tended to be self-actualising and also espousing motivations similar to those of mass tourists. It was also proposed that WTP can provide a basis for economically analysing the use of passive values of environmental tourism resources, such as land, which can facilitate the industry&#65533;s ability in decision making, and management. As an incentive, WTP for communal values of land can be crucial in enhancing and sustaining tourism in a land-scarce economy such as Fiji. In the interim, WTP for communal land use could also provide informed decisions to address current issues such as the Customary Fisheries Bill. Indeed, this pioneering study examines the very issues of passive values for traditionally owned resources which can be applied more broadly; not only in Fiji, but also in other parts of the Pacific.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">backpacking</field><field name="subject">commons</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.121054</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk factors for venous thromboembolism</field><field name="creator">Parkin, Lianne</field><field name="description">Background: Many risk factors for venous thromboembolism have been identified, but two particular exposures - the use of combined oral contraceptives and long-distance air travel - have generated considerable concern in recent years. In contrast, a possible link between venous thromboembolism and a third exposure - the use of psychotropic drugs - was first raised in the 1950s, but has received surprisingly little attention. Information about all three exposures and the risk of fatal events is limited. These risks were examined in three inter-related national population-based studies. 
 Methods: The underlying study population included all men and women aged 15 - 59 years who died in New Zealand between 1990 and 2000, for whom the underlying cause of death was pulmonary embolism. 
 The potential associations between fatal pulmonary embolism and the use of oral contraceptives and psychotropic drugs were explored in a general practice records-based case-control study. Non-users were the reference category for all analyses. Contraceptive supply data were used to estimate the absolute risk of death from pulmonary embolism in users of oral contraceptives. 
 A second case-control study, in which computer-assisted telephone interviews were undertaken with the next of kin of cases who had been resident in New Zealand, and with sex and age-matched controls randomly selected from the electoral roll, investigated the possible association between long-distance air travel and fatal pulmonary embolism. 
 Finally, the absolute risk of dying from pulmonary embolism following a long-distance flight was estimated in a descriptive study based on official migration data and deaths in recent air travellers. 
 Results: The adjusted odds ratio for use of any oral contraceptive in the three months before the index date (the onset of the fatal episode) was 13.1 (95% CI 4.4 - 39.0). The odds ratio for formulations containing desogestrel and gestodene was about three times higher than the point estimate for levonorgestrel products; preparations containing cyproterone acetate appeared to carry the highest risk. The estimated absolute risk of fatal pulmonary embolism in current users of oral contraceptives was 10.5 (95% CI 6.2 - 16.6) per million woman-years. 
 The adjusted odds ratio for current use of any antipsychotic was 13.3 (95% CI 2.3 - 76.3). Low-potency antipsychotics carried a 20-fold increase in risk; thioridazine was the main drug involved. Antidepressant use was also associated with a significantly increased risk (adjusted odds ratio 4.9 [95% CI 1.1 - 22.5]). 
 Compared with non-travellers, people who had undertaken a flight of more than eight hours&#65533; duration in the preceding four weeks were eight times more likely to die from pulmonary embolism (odds ratio 7.9 [95% CI 1.1 - 55.1]). The absolute risk of fatal pulmonary embolism following air travel of more than eight hours was 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 - 3.0) per million arrivals. 
 Conclusions: The present research was the first to have estimated the relative risks of fatal pulmonary embolism in relation to three exposures: oral contraceptive use in a population in which preparations containing desogestrel and gestodene preparations were widely used, conventional antipsychotics, and long-distance air travel. The findings were consistent with previous, and subsequent, studies of non-fatal events. Increased risks of fatal pulmonary embolism in users of antidepressants, and in people with an intellectual disability, have not been described previously and warrant further investigation. Referral and diagnostic biases are very unlikely in these studies of fatal events, and other types of bias and possible confounding are considered unlikely explanations for the findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thromboembolism</field><field name="subject">thrombophlebitis</field><field name="subject">risk factors</field><field name="subject">veins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.145314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of very prolonged and sustained exercise</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Samuel John Edwin</field><field name="description">Little is known about the strain and consequences of very prolonged and sustained exercise lasting multiple days. This thesis comprises two multi-day exercise field studies and a 24-h, controlled-trial field/laboratory study. The field studies were undertaken using international adventure races (2003 and 2004 Southern Traverses: 86-120 h) to profile exercise intensity and associated physiological and psychophysical strain, and physical and cognitive performance. The 2003 study showed that exercise intensity (from heart rate range) averaged 64% during the first 12 h, dropped to 41% by 24 h, and remained so thereafter. Body core temperature (gastrointestinal pills), throughout racing (n=8) was relatively stable (min 36.0&#65533;C and only briefly &gt;39&#65533;C), despite widely varying endogenous and exogenous thermal stress. Blood samples obtained before (n=34), during (n=11) and after (n=34) racing revealed a large plasma volume expansion (24%), with stable [sodium]plasma (n=6). Acute (15-30 h) and chronic (96-120 h) elevation of neutrophil, monocyte and lymphocyte numbers were observed across the race. Standardised exercise tests (rest, 25 and 50% peak power output (PPO)) before and after racing (n=9) revealed an extreme shift toward fat utilisation, consistent with lowered fat mass (11%; n=44) and high [free fatty acids]plasma (up 370%; n=9) at race-finish, although [HAD]muscle was unchanged. Muscle glycogen was only 50% lower post-race (290 nmol&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;d.w.). Complex cognitive performance (Stroop test) impairment was attenuated during 50% PPO post-race. Perceived exertion uncoupled from HR at standardised workloads. Explosive power (jump test; n=24) and anaerobic power (30-s Wingate; n=27) were modestly (&lt;10%) impacted. Strength reduction of arms (11%) and legs (17%) was equivalent (p=0.17). The 2004 study (n=4) involved dissimilar terrain, vegetation, and sequence of exercise modes, yet the profile of exercise intensity was similar: first 12 h 65%, then 45% by 24 h and thereafter. Thus, athletes reliably attain sustainable, low-to-moderate exercise intensity by 24 h. Plasma volume, neutrophil and monocyte responses were reliable across races, whereas lymphocytes were not. Plasma [IL-6] and [S100&#946;] were elevated, substantially in some individuals (IL-6: 223 pg&#65533;mL&#8315;&#65533;; S100&#946;: 113 pg&#65533;mL&#8315;&#65533;), during racing. A 24-h adventure race simulation (n=9) was then undertaken to investigate physiological and psychophysical factors influencing exercise intensity, autonomic function and orthostatic tolerance. Tests were at 0, ~7, ~15 and 24 h. The 24-h HR profile matched that observed during racing: first 12 h 58% (including 3-h testing), remainder 41%. The shift toward fat utilisation was almost complete within 7 h, and similar to that following 2003 race. The perceived exertion-to-HR uncoupling was also similar; being complete within 15 h. Plasma [noradrenaline] for rest and 12-km&#65533;h&#8315;&#65533; run was elevated post-simulation. Plasma [IL-6] peaked by 7 h, although not as high as field observations. The timeframe of metabolic change and perceived exertion uncoupling coincided with that of pace reduction, and may be important regulatory components of very prolonged exercise intensity. Orthostatic intolerance was evident during the simulation (n=6/9), as was cerebral hypo-perfusion (15 h &amp; 24 h). Autonomic function (baroreflex sensitivity, sympathetic activation, parasympathetic withdrawal) was altered only at 7 h, whereas postural-induced hypotension (via impaired venous response) and hypocapnia were always present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern Traverse (Race)</field><field name="subject">exercise</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">energy metabolism</field><field name="subject">endurance sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080716.142609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile New Zealand : a multi-method comparative study of cell phone use</field><field name="creator">Broege, Stephanie</field><field name="description">Worldwide use of mobile phones has created a new basis for interpersonal communication and has become a ubiquitous feature of youth culture. Hence the examination of global mobile phone adoption is a global challenge for communication researchers as well as for the media industries. Thus far, New Media research in New Zealand (NZ) has focused on children and teenagers. The group of young adults between 18-25 years has rarely been surveyed. This thesis focused on university students&#65533; use of mobile communication in NZ in the context of their everyday practices. The Mobile Media Study (MMS) was designed as a cross-national comparative research project with a focus on NZ together with one European and one North American country. The usage behavior, experiences, attitudes, and opinions of young NZers&#65533; towards mobile phone use was examined and contrasted to young German and American students. Methodological and data triangulation was applied and data was collected at the University of Otago, the City University of New York, the Pennsylvania State University, and the University of Leipzig. MMS survey research was conducted along with focus group and personal interviews, and qualitative exercises. In addition, the latest data from a longitudinal study of New Media use in Germany, the US and NZ served as a secondary, comparative, and complementary dataset. 
 The research questions focused on general mobile phone use, text-messaging (SMS), the acceptance of Third Generation (3G) cell phones, mobile phone use in public places, gender-specific usages, and the construction of mobile social networks. Altogether, data from 1,316 students at four universities in three countries was analyzed. Results indicated that the number of providers as well as tariff structures appear to influence mobile phone adoption within a country. To adjust to the duopoly situation young people in NZ preferred prepaid cards in connection with a SMS package. This was reflected by extraordinarily high use of SMS in NZ. By comparison German and American students preferred annual contracts. Americans, who had the strongest preference for mobile calling, also had the highest monthly expenses. Additionally, findings revealed that overall user interest in 3G services is not yet very high. It was found that in particular NZ students do not exploit the full range of mobile services already available to them and feel confident that their current cell phone gratifies all their needs. They concentrate on using basic functions, such as calling and SMS. In addition, results suggest a decreasing role of the landline telephone and email for interpersonal communication. 
 Gender differences were found with NZ women in particular being most enthusiastic about SMS. German men had the most negative attitude toward SMS and also used the service the least in comparison to the other students surveyed. In general women had a preference for the communicative functions on their mobile phone including voicemail and more women than men in Germany and NZ were found to play mobile phone games. Finally, evidence of gender specific social network structures were found in NZ with male networks resembling spider webs while female networks were centered so that all persons in the network connected back to the center. Overall, students only used a fraction of the contacts in their mobile phone book and communicated mostly within a limited local area. In conclusion, a replication of the MMS was suggested along with further multi-method research in the field of Asian-NZer&#65533;s New Media use.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellular telephones</field><field name="subject">telecommunication</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">social networks</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080819.150246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the negative effect of cross-examination questioning on the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports</field><field name="creator">Righarts, Saskia Anne</field><field name="description">A growing body of research suggests that cross-examination may be detrimental to the accuracy of children&#65533;s event reports. The primary goal of the present research was to investigate three specific ways in which the negative effect of cross-examination could be reduced. 
 Experiment 1 examined the effect of reducing the delay between the collection of the primary evidence and cross-examination. Five- and 6-year-old children (N = 76) took part in a staged event and were interviewed 1 to 2 days later. In this interview, children were asked to recall everything they could remember about the event. Children were then asked specific yes/no questions. Next, either 1 to 3 days or 8 months later, all children were interviewed for a second time in a cross-examination format. The 8-month delay was equivalent to the average delay experienced by children in New Zealand courts (Lash, 1995). The aim of the cross-examination interview was to talk the children out of their original responses, irrespective of the accuracy of their original account. Cross-examination questioning had a significant negative effect on the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports, regardless of timing. That is, children cross-examined soon after the memory event performed no better than those who were cross-examined after an 8-month delay. Furthermore, one week after cross-examination, children were interviewed again. The purpose of this interview was to establish whether children actually believed the responses they had given during cross-examination. During this interview, many children reversed what they had said during cross-examination, indicating that the responses they had given during cross-examination were due primarily to compliance to authority. 
 Given the finding that compliance to authority played a significant role in children&#65533;s cross-examination performance in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 addressed whether a pre-interview intervention aimed to decrease compliance would reduce the negative impact of cross-examination. Five- and 6-year-old children (n = 59) and 9- and 10-year-old children (n = 62) participated in the same staged event and were interviewed for their primary evidence as in Experiment 1. Prior to the cross-examination interview, however, some children were warned that the interviewer might ask some questions which were tricky and that it was okay to tell her that she was wrong. Warning children prior to the cross-examination interview did not reduce the negative impact of cross-examination for either age group, even when the warning was delivered by the cross-examining interviewer. 
 Experiment 3 addressed whether a more intensive pre-interview intervention could reduce the negative impact of cross-examination. Using the same experimental procedures as Experiment 2, half of the 5- and 6-year-old children (n = 77) and 9- and 10-year-old children (n = 87) received a practice and feedback session with cross-examination type questions prior to the target interview. While cross-examination still resulted in a decrease in children&#65533;s accuracy, children in the preparation condition performed significantly better than the control children. 
 Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the negative effect of cross-examination is highly robust and that compliance appears to be the underlying mechanism responsible for this. A practice and feedback session targeting the factors that contribute to compliance reduced, but did not eliminate, the negative effect of this questioning style. Therefore, children&#65533;s accuracy may be facilitated to some extent by cross-examination preparation prior to testifying.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child witnesses</field><field name="subject">cross-examination</field><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">authority</field><field name="subject">evidence (law)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080827.093855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in the New Zealand population</field><field name="creator">Rockell, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Adequate vitamin D status plays an important role in bone health and may also protect against Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis and certain cancers. Vitamin D is obtained from two sources; diet and through skin synthesis through the action of ultraviolet (UV) light. Dietary intakes of vitamin D are low in New Zealand (NZ) and the majority of our vitamin D comes from UV exposure. The NZ population may be at risk of low vitamin D status because of low dietary intakes, the country&#65533;s latitude (35-46 &#65533;S), and high proportion of darker skinned Maori and Pacific People. While case reports have described the occurrence of rickets, predominantly in immigrant groups, there are currently no national data on the vitamin D status of the NZ population. Reports of low vitamin D status in countries of similar latitude to NZ justify an examination of New Zealanders&#65533; vitamin D status. The best method to assess of vitamin D status is to measure circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. 
 This thesis comprises three main studies. The first two had the following aims: to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in a national sample (n=1585) of NZ children aged 5-14 y and to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and their determinants in a national sample (n=2948) of New Zealanders aged 15 y and over. The 2002 Children&#65533;s Nutrition Survey CNS02 was a year long (December, March-November) cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of NZ school children 5-14 y. Over-sampling of Maori and Pacific children allowed ethnic specific analyses. The 1997 National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) participants were recruited over one year according to an area-based sampling frame with a 3 stage stratified design consisting of primary sampling units, households within each unit, and one randomly selected respondent from each household. Mean (99% CI) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were similar in children and adults (both 50 nmol/L). Among Maori, Pacific and NZEO children respectively, prevalence (%, 99% CI) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (&lt; 17.5 nmol/L) was 5% (2, 12), 8% (5, 14), and 3% (1,7). Based on a cutoff of &lt; 37.5 nmol/L, prevalence of insufficiency was 41% (29, 53), 59% (42, 75) and 25% (15, 35), respectively. Based on a cutoff of 50 nmol/L, 56% of children were insufficient. Three percent of adult New Zealanders had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations indicative of deficiency ([less than or equal to] 17.5 nmol/L); 48% and 84% were insufficient based on cutoffs of [less than or equal to] 50 and [less than or equal to] 80 nmol/L The main determinants of vitamin D status in NZ children were season, ethnicity and sex. After adjustment for other factors and covariates, boys had an adjusted mean (99% CI) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration 5 (1, 9) nmol/L higher than girls, Maori children were 7 (2, 11) and Pacific children 15 (11, 20) nmol/L lower than NZ European and Other (NZEO) children. Obese children were 7 (2, 11) nmol/L lower than overweight or &#65533;normal&#65533; weight. Children&#65533;s mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (adjusted for other variables) peaked in March (69 nmol/L) and was at its lowest in August (36 nmol/L). 
 In adults, there were effects of a similar magnitude of ethnicity and season on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Obesity, latitude and age were determinants of vitamin D status in women but not men. Obese (BMI &gt; 30) women had an adjusted mean vitamin concentration 6 (3, 10) nmol/L lower than women with BMI &lt; 25. Women living in the South Island were 6 (3, 9) nmol/L lower than women living in the North Island. Additionally, adjusted mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 13 (8, 18) higher in women 15 -18 y than women 65 y or older. 
 The third and final study aimed to determine whether the higher rates of vitamin D inadequacy reported in the winter than summer months in NZ also result in higher PTH concentrations, which would provide evidence for functional effect of inadequate vitamin D status. We also aimed to objectively explore the effect of natural skin colour on vitamin D status, given the higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in dark-skinned groups living far from the equator. Skin colour measurements were taken with a hand-held light reflectometer (Datacolor Mercury[TM] 1000 colorimeter, Lawrenceville, NJ). 
 In the 342 residents of Invercargill and Dunedin, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower in the late summer versus early spring (79 vs 51 nmol/L; P&lt; 0.001). The lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in early spring versus summer was associatedwith a 2 pg/mL (P&lt; 0.001) higher parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. Interestingly, no significant effect of natural skin colour, based on light reflectance at the inside of the upper arm, was discovered, though there was a positive effect of tanning, based on light reflectance at the upper forearm, on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. 
 Ethnicity and season are major determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in New Zealanders. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in NZ children and adults, which may contribute to increased risk of osteoporosis and other chronic disease. While there is a pressing need for more convincing evidence with regards to the health risks associated with the low vitamin D status in children, evidence from the study of adults, where higher PTH concentrations were found during spring versus summer, suggests that the low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are having an adverse effect on bone health of adults. The high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in New Zealanders, warrants serious consideration of strategies such as fortification, to improve the vitamin D status of the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin D in the body</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand population</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080929.142611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acute effects of lithium on the rat kidney</field><field name="creator">Jing, Yu</field><field name="description">The aim of the experiments reported in the present work was: first, to generate a rat model of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and, second, to use this to test the hypothesis that the effects of lithium were far more reaching than merely the inhibition of vasopressin induced translocation and synthesis of the water channel protein AQP2. Specifically, the effect of lithium on the abundance and distribution of the other water channel proteins, AQP1, AQP3 and AQP4 was investigated. It was found that AQP3 protein abundance was significantly reduced in the renal medulla while AQP4 was not affected. In addition, it was further hypothesized that, given the known effects of lithium on the urea transporter UT-A1 and on sodium channels and transporters, the renal medullary osmotic gradient would be dissipated by lithium. This was examined indirectly by determining the amounts of organic osmolytes in the renal medulla of rats with lithium-induced NDI. Myo-inositol was found to be 85 &#65533; 9 mmol kg&#8315;1 protein in the NDI rats, a reduction of 38% compared with control values, sotbitol fell from 35&#65533; 9 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; in the control rats to 2.5 &#65533; 0.5 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533;, and glycerophosphorylcholine levels in the experimental animals were 91 &#65533; 18 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein compared with 372 &#65533; 72 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; in the controls. In addition, betaine decreased to 38 &#65533; 2 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein from 69 &#65533; 10 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein in the control. The urea content of the medulla was found to have fallen from 2868 &#65533; 558 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein to 480 &#65533; 105 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein. These data indicated that indeed the medullary osmotic gradient, the driving force for AVP-dependent fluid reabsorption in the kidney was greatly reduced during lithium-induced NDI. 
 Thirdly, it was proposed that the sodium-channel blocker, amiloride, by acting to prevent lithium entry into the cells of the collecting duct, should ameliorate or abolish the adverse effects of lithium on the kidney. Treatment of rats with established NDI, with amiloride, reversed to a large extent the reduction in aquaporin protein expression and re-established the medullary osmotic gradient, as assessed by the ability of treated rats to concentrate their urine, and by the rise in amounts of medullary osmolytes. Administration of 0.5 mmol l&#8315;&#65533; amiloride to lithium-treated rats led to medullary AQP2 and AQP3 protein abundance increasing by 82% &#65533; 16% and 110% &#65533; 4% of the control level respectively. The content of urea in the medulla also increased to 2474 &#65533; 557 mmol kg&#8315;&#65533; protein. 
 Finally, since in humans it is known that the chronic effect of lithium on the kidney is to cause cortical fibrosis and renal failure, microarray studies were commenced to look for evidence of early changes in gene activity in response to lithium-administration. The results showed that 77 genes were either up- or down-regulated, in particular, genes that are involved in the apoptosis pathway. 
 In the light of these results it is plausible to suggest that the acute renal effects of lithium to induce NDI can be effectively mitigated, and reversed, by administration of amiloride. Whether this can serve to offset the chronic effects of lithium on the kidney awaits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kidneys</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">lithium</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080930.145652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol in society and education : Durkheimian perspectives</field><field name="creator">Mundy-McPherson, Stuart</field><field name="description">The present study utilises a Durkheimian approach to study alcohol in society and education, centrally drawing on the sociological works of Emile Durkheim and those of the neo-Durkheimian sociologist, Stjepan Mestrovic. Durkheim&#65533;s sociological concepts and commentary, and Mestrovic&#65533;s perspective, refashioned, is applied to the present context, of which alcohol is a part. The arument to be advanced, is that in the Durkheimian sense, societal and educational alcohol issues, as part of wider social change, are in a state of excessive anomie and egoism caused by neoliberal philosophy, policy and practice. Mostly, the theory of James M. Buchanan will be drawn upon as standing for neoliberalism. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s interpretation of Durkheim in the light of his view of the indirect influence of Arthur Schopenhauer on Durkheim, particularly with regard to Schopenhauer&#65533;s view of will and representation, provides a fresh reading of Durkheim&#65533;s work. Mestrovic&#65533;s adaptations challenge the received view of Durkheim as a functionalist, and Enlightenment positivist interested in social order. This is explained by noting Mestrovic&#65533;s application of those adaptations to some of Durkheim&#65533;s central concepts, and, Mestrovic&#65533;s identification of the contemporary relevance of Durkheim, culminating in what Mestrovic calls postemotionalism. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s Shopenhauerian Durkheimianism, and Durkheim, can be critiqued from the perspectives of a number of commentators, poststructuralism and, Jennifer Lehmann&#65533;s critical structuralism with regard to issues of particularly gender, but also culture, as well as for exhibiting essentialist and liberal strains. Buchanan is also liberal and essentialist, but differently to Durkheim, holds to an economic, individualistic and clearly positivist view of society and education. By comparison with Durkheimianism, however, Buchanan&#65533;s perspective is a good representative example of true neoliberalism. Durkheim in particular, is rendered as a liberal - by comparison to Buchanan, a very social democratic liberal thinker, but one still in need of further adaptations over and above those made by Mestrovic for a Durkheimianism relevant to contemporary issues of gender and culture with regard to policy and practice in society and education where alcohol is concerned. 
 Mestrovic&#65533;s perspective and Durkheim&#65533;s concepts, when modified by way of discussed and synthesised supplementary, high-modern and poststructural, post-Freudian feminist, and semiological, radical theories of gender and culture, is relevant for studying society and education. 
 The application of Durkheimian perspectives, so rendered, means that various issues related to alcohol such as, alcohol and other addictions and dysfunctions, gendered drinking, gendered family relations, alcohol use and abuse, media advertising, research studies philosophies, culture, local and global markets, as well as legislation, can be seen in an alternative way. 
 Following Durkheimian perspectives means that education can be contextualised accordingly. Educational governance, professionalism, teacher training and curriculum reform policies and programmes related and specific to alcohol education, can be interpreted in alternative ways to those currently accepted.

Nematodes, in particular, are arguably the most abundant metazoans on Earth and often form highly diverse communities in marine sediments. The study of meiofauna, however, often lags behind that of macrofauna, probably due to the small size of meiofaunal organisms and the paucity of suitably-trained taxonomists or para-taxonomists. Our understanding of basic ecological questions, such as the role of meiofauna in the energetics of benthic communities, as well as the nature and extent of possible relationships between meiofauna and macrofauna in detritus-based communities, is still limited. The present study aimed to address these questions in the context of intertidal seagrass (Zostera muelleri) meadows and adjoining unvegetated sediments in Papanui Inlet, Otago Peninsula. The near absence of taxonomical and ecological studies on free-living marine nematode species in New Zealand also prompted the description of several new species and as well as a comparison of species assemblages from the study sites. 
 Meiofaunal abundance (range: 1325-4979 ind. 10cm&#65533;) in the top 5cm of sediments was not significantly different inside and outside the seagrass meadow. Meiofaunal biomass and production estimates were small relative to macrofauna (approx. 1 and 5% of macrofaunal values, respectively), with little variation in both meiofaunal and macrofaunal values between vegetated and unvegetated habitats. Analysis of the isotopic and fatty acid composition of primary producers, sediment organic matter, and consumers at the study sites suggest that a significant proportion of secondary productivity in seagrass meadows is fuelled by macrophyte detritus. These data suggest that secondary productivity in the seagrass meadow was limited by the low palatability of macrophyte detritus compared with microalgal food sources, resulting in lower trophic transfer efficiency in vegetated sediments. These results contrast with previous findings showing a large contribution of meiofauna to the secondary productivity of vegetated sediments, as well as greater secondary productivity inside than outside seagrass meadows. The nature of the sediments (coarse particle size with low organic matter content) is likely to have led to low meiofauna biomass whilst favouring large suspension feeders. The low availability of high quality food sources (i.e. seston, benthic microalgae, and epiphytes) in vegetated sediments may have contributed to the lower than expected secondary productivity inside the seagrass meadow. 
 Most of the dominant nematode species found at the study sites were new to science, and 6 new species were described. Significant differences were found in the nematode assemblages between sites and sediment depths. There was a trend of greater nematode diversity and abundance in vegetated sediments, but this was restricted to the uppermost 2cm of sediments. The effect of seagrass on nematode assemblages is likely to be mediated by the effect of blades on sediment characteristics and the presence of roots. The present study suggests that the presence of Zostera muelleri results in greater biodiversity of sheltered soft-shore communities on a local scale. 
 The addition of &#65533;&#65533;C-labelled macroalgal detritus (Enteromorpha) to microcosms in a feeding experiment resulted in minimal labelling of harpacticoid copepods and nematodes. Lack of change in the fatty acid composition of the latter also suggests limited assimilation of detritus during the experiment. It is likely that consumers choose benthic microalgae over detritus when both food sources are available in the field. High content of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in nematodes from the field suggests, for the first time, that they are a high quality food source to higher trophic levels. 
 A feeding experiment investigating the effect of bacterivorous nematodes on detritus assimilation rates by amphipods did not support the hypothesis that nematodes increase the trophic transfer efficiency between detritus and macrofaunal detritivores. It is unclear whether amphipods preferentially fed on detritus or whether nematodes escaped predation by burrowing deeper in the sediment. Data obtained in the present study, however, shows that marine bacterivorous nematodes can biosynthesise/accumulate HUFAs in high concentrations despite their low concentrations in their diet. Nematodes could, therefore, provide an important source of these essential nutrients to bulk deposit feeders living in otherwise HUFA-poor sediments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meiofauna</field><field name="subject">nematodes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Papanui Inlet</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081124.143019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of solutes, debris and temperature on the shear strength of basal ice in cold-based glaciers</field><field name="creator">Sirota, Paul</field><field name="description">Isotropic ice samples containing measured concentrations of solutes and debris similar to basal material found in several cold-based glaciers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, were manufactured in a laboratory and tested for peak shear strength at constant strain rates with a direct-shear device. The shear tests show that differences in rheology and shear strength appear to be related to impurity content and concentration. Debris-laden ice becomes more ductile with greater concentrations of solutes, whereas, low solute-concentrations and high debris-concentrations are associated with increases in shear strength and brittle behaviour. Stress exponents from Glen&#65533;s flow law calculated for isotropic solute and debris-laden ice ranged between 4 and 5, leading to the conclusion that higher rates of deformation may be expected in dirty basal ice than predicted for glacial ice models that use stress exponents where, n = 3. Observations of both natural and synthetic samples tested over a range of temperatures between -25&#65533;C and -5&#65533;C showed that natural basal ice samples containing high solute and debris concentrations were highly sensitive to temperature change. These tests showed an approximate 10 % loss in shear strength for every 1&#65533;C increase in temperature between -25&#65533;C and -10&#65533;C. In addition, contrasts in rheology and rates of deformation within basal ice are responsible for the development of debris-laden ice structures in the basal zones of cold-based glaciers that flow over unconsolidated substrates. As layered sedimentary bedding was preserved in frozen blocks within the deforming basal ice of several of these glaciers, the evidence suggests that at some point each glacier has interacted with its bed and entrained portions of the substrate material. Empirical shear strength data and observations of rheological changes attributed to composition together with evidence acquired during fieldwork in Antarctica help to support the argument that cold-based glaciers flowing over unconsolidated sediment are capable of affecting geomorphic change. Hence, isotropic ice models that exclude basal processes may need to be adjusted, especially where small increases in the temperature of the basal zones of cold glaciers may occur. In conclusion, palaeo-climate inferences based purely upon small amounts of geomorphic evidence, which suggest warmer climate conditions, may need to be re-evaluated in order to portray more accurate renditions of formerly glaciated landscapes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="subject">glaciers</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Dry Valleys Region</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081204.142406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha modulates hippocampal long-term potentiation, in vivo</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Chanel Jayne</field><field name="description">Alzheimer&#65533;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, charaeterised by progressive loss of memory. It is important to understand what factors initiate the onset of AD so that effective therapeutic treatments can be developed to target the precise mechanisms that initiate this disease. Currently, synaptic dysfunction is widely believed to be the first significant alteration preceding the onset of AD, and is thought to be initiated by an intracellular accumulation of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;), or a free radical-induced increase of oxidative stress. As A&#946; levels rise during the onset of AD, a concomitant reduction of secreted amyloid precursor protein-&#945; (sAPP&#945;) is observed, as the two proteins exist in equilibrium. Intriguingly, the neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties of sAPP&#945; indicate that it is intimately involved in the physiological pathways of the major hypotheses for the cause of AD, and may also be involved in the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. Therefore, it is possible that during the onset of AD, the decrease of sAPP&#945; may contribute to synaptic dysfunction by disrupting the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. 
 Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the leading experimental model for investigating the neural substrate of memory formation, and describes the molecular mechanisms that underlie an increase in the strength of synaptic transmission. The role sAPP&#945; may play in the induction and maintenance of LTP has not previously been addressed in vivo. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to investigate whether sAPP&#945; affects the induction of LTP in the hippocampus of the anaesthetised rat. The present findings are the first to suggest that sAPP&#945; may modulate the induction of LTP in vivo. Decreasing the function of endogenous sAPP&#945; (with sAPP&#945;-binding antibodies and a pharmacological inhibition of &#945;-secretase) significantly reduced the magnitude of LTP induced in the dentate gyrus. Therefore, the reduction of sAPP&#945; during AD is likely to have a detrimental impact on the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and by extension, learning and memory. The present investigation has also found that the application of recombinant, purified sAPP&#945; to the rat hippocampus has an &#65533;inverted U-shaped&#65533; dose-response effect on the magnitude of LTP. Low concentrations of sAPP&#945; significantly enhanced LTP, supporting previous findings that exogenous sAPP&#945; can facilitate in vitro LTP and enhance memory performance in animals. On the other hand, comparatively high concentrations of sAPP&#945; significantly decreased the magnitude of LTP. This observation is also consistent with previous findings, in which high concentrations of sAPP&#945; have been shown to be less synaptogenic and memory enhancing than lower doses. These results are the first to suggest that sAPP&#945; modulates in vivo synaptic plasticity, and have important implications for the development of strategies to treat AD.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">amyloid beta-protein precursor</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081217.144344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid effects of estrogen on intracellular calcium levels in adult GnRH neurons</field><field name="creator">Romano, Nicola</field><field name="description">The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons of the hypothalamus are the principal regulators of reproductive function and are strongly modulated by estrogen (E&#8322;). Several studies indicate that E&#8322; is able to influence GnRH neurons, both with "classical" long-term transcriptional effects, and with rapid non-transcriptional effects. One most interesting action of E&#8322; is that of modulating intracellular calcium concentration [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I: this has been shown to happen in many different cell types, including embryonic models of GnRH neurons. 
 The aim of this project was to evaluate if these rapid effects of E&#8322; on [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I also happen at the level of adult GnRH neurons. In order to study the acute effects of E&#8322; on calcium dynamics, a novel transgenic mouse line was generated, that allows real-time measurement of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I selectively in GnRH neurons in an acute brain slice preparation. Using this mouse line, our group has previously shown that these cells show spontaneous activity in the form of Ca&#65533;&#8314; transients. 
 A first set of experiments was designed to define the effects of E&#8322; on spontaneous activity. E&#8322; was found to modulate [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I in a activity-dependent manner: it increased the frequency of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients in about 50% of GnRH neurons with low spontaneous activity, whereas it decreased the frequency of the transients in more than 80% spontaneously active GnRH neurons. Different experiments were then performed in order to determine the molecular pathways that generates these opposite effects. 
 The inhibitory effect was reproduced by the membrane-impermeable compound E2-6-BSA, indicating that it happens through a membrane receptor. The E&#8322; isomer l7&#945;-estradiol was also able to reproduce the inhibitory effect of E&#8322;, suggesting the involvement of some non-classical receptor. This is also confirmed by the presence of this effect in estrogen-receptor &#946; (ER-&#946;) knock-out mice, which exclude the involvement of this receptor. 
 The stimulatory effect was found to be generated through a novel, indirect mechanism. It cannot be reproduced by E2-6-BSA nor by l7&#945;-estradiol, and it is still present in the ER-&#946; knock-out mice. The stimulation, though, can be reproduced in about 50% of cells with an ER-&#945; selective agonist. As this receptor is not present in GnRH neurons, an indirect mechanism must be generating the stimulatory effect. Blockage of action potential mediated synaptic transmission with tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not block E&#8322; effects, but blockage of non-action potential mediated GABAergic transmission using the GABA[A] selective blocker gabazine completely abolished them. Our hypothesis is therefore that E&#8322; stimulates the generation of [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients through estrogen-receptor a (ER-&#945;) located in the terminals of GABAergic afferents. This modulation, in turn, is able to determine release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from IP&#8323;-sensitive intracellular stores. To confirm this, we applied exogenous GABA to the neurons and found that it was able to initiate [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients. Furthermore, removal of tonic GABAergic tone with gabazine was able to block spontaneous activity. 
 To further analyse the effects of E&#8322;, Ca&#65533;&#8314; imaging experiments were performed together with cell-attached patch clamp electrophysiological recordings in order to correlate the electrical activity with the calcium activity. Simultaneous recordings revealed a strong correlation between [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I transients and bursts of action currents in adult GnRH neurons. E&#8322; was able to increase the electrical activity of GnRH neurons with low spontaneous activity, and inhibit that of highly active ones. Application of GABA to GnRH neurons resulted in increased firing, accompanied by an increase in [Ca&#65533;&#8314;]I. 
 These observations provide evidence for a complex mechanism of E&#8322; action on adult GnRH neurons, that may be important for the generation of the pulsatile release of this hormone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">calcium in the body</field><field name="subject">luteinizing hormone releasing hormone</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090310.144345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing children&#65533;s responses to cross-examination questioning</field><field name="creator">O'Neill, Sarah Christine</field><field name="description">Under an adversarial legal system, witnesses&#65533; testimony may be challenged by the opposing lawyer during cross-examination. Cross-examination has been shown to negatively affect the accuracy of children&#65533;s event reports, but as yet, the mechanisms driving this effect are unknown. 
 Experiment 1 aimed to tease apart the roles of question type and repeated interviewing in mediating children&#65533;s cross-examination performance. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 82) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 103) took part in a staged event, and 1 to 2 days later they took part in a direct examination interview. Next, either 1 to 3 days or 6 months later, all children were interviewed for a second time. For half of the children, this second interview was a repeat of their direct examination interview. The remaining children were interviewed in a cross-examination format. A second interview reduced response accuracy after both short and long delays, however, cross-examination questioning impaired the accuracy of children&#65533;s reports the most. 
 Although, overall, children have considerable difficulty answering cross-examination questions correctly, variation in their performance has been observed. Experiment 2 assessed whether individual differences in cognitive abilities mediate cross-examination performance. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 116) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 58) visited the police station and subsequently reported their experiences in direct examination and cross-examination interviews. Children&#65533;s memory, receptive language ability, expressive language ability, and intelligence were also measured. Age, intelligence, and memory predicted aspects of cross-examination performance. Overall, these cognitive factors accounted for between 16.6% and 19.5% of the variance in cross-examination outcome measures. 
 Given the negative effect of cross-examination on children&#65533;s responding, and our inability to identify the children who are most at risk of poor performance during this interview, Experiment 3 assessed our ability to facilitate children&#65533;s responding to cross-examination questioning. Specifically, the effect of manipulating the timing of a pre-trial intervention, which gives children practice and feedback at cross-examination questioning, was investigated. Five- and 6-year-olds (N = 88) and 9- and 10-year-olds (N = 108) visited the police station. One to 3 days later they completed the direct examination interview and 6 months after the event, children were cross-examined. The timing of the preparation intervention was varied (1-day, 1-week, 1-month before cross-examination), and the children&#65533;s subsequent cross-examination performance was compared to that of children in the control group. When the preparation intervention was delivered 1 day or 1 week before the cross-examination interview, children&#65533;s cross-examination performance was significantly improved. 
 The findings from the three experiments suggest that cross-examination is likely to pose considerable problems for children, especially younger children. Our greater understanding of factors that influence children&#65533;s responding to cross-examination questioning may guide reform of the cross-examination process for child witnesses. Bottom-up initiatives, such as pre-trial preparation, and top-down changes, including educating professionals, expert testimony, and reducing the delay to cross-examination, may improve the reliability of child witnesses&#65533; testimony during cross-examination.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-examination</field><field name="subject">child witnesses</field><field name="subject">forensic psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090428.150450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and functional characterisation of proteins that regulate the floral repressor, FLC</field><field name="creator">Risk, Joanna M</field><field name="description">Successful reproduction in plants is a highly-regulated process reliant on the integration of both endogenous and external cues. Different accessions of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been collected, including those with a winter annual or rapid-cycling flowering habit. Natural variation and mutant screens have enabled many flowering time genes to be identified. A key regulator of flowering is FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FLC is a repressor of flowering and is regulated by a number of genes, including those in the autonomous and FRIGIDA-mediated pathways. 
 Of particular interest are FRIGIDA (FRI) and FRIGIDA-LIKE 1 (FRL1) and the autonomous pathway members, FCA and FY. FRI and FRL 1 promote FLC expression making them dominant repressors of flowering. FRI is proposed to initiate chromatin remodelling at the FLC locus leading to increased FLC expression. Once elevated, FLC levels are maintained until plants undergo an extended period of cold, therefore flowering occurs in spring. In contrast, FCA and FY promote flowering by repressing FLC expression. FCA has also been identified as a receptor of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Upon binding to FCA, ABA is proposed to disrupt/inhibit the FCA:FY interaction which results in delayed flowering. 
 To characterise the FCA:ABA interaction and identify the ABA binding site, a number of truncated FCA proteins were utilised. Initially a FCA:FY GST-pulldown was used to identify the ABA binding site. However, when ABA failed to inhibit the FCA:FY interaction a direct binding assay using [&#65533;H]-ABA was employed. Another Arabidopsis ABA receptor, G-protein coupled receptor 2 (GCR2), was used as a positive control in these binding assays. Both FCA and GCR2 failed to bind [&#65533;H]-ABA suggesting a broader issue with the binding assay. The identification of FCA and GCR2 as ABA receptors can be attributed to the quality of the protein assayed, the sensitivity of the binding assay and the subsequent data analysis. This study resulted in the retraction of the original paper (Razem et at, 2006) reporting FCA as an ABA receptor. 
 To investigate the molecular mechanism by which FRI and FRL1 act as positive regulators of FLC expresion, a biochemical approach was taken. FRI and FRL1 have no known homology to any other protein or domain and the only method for assessing protein function is through plant complementation experiments. In the absence of sequence homology, or a timely functional assay, a classical approach was taken to produce soluble protein for analysis. Truncation of predicted regions of disorder and expression, solubility and stability screens produced soluble protein of reasonable purity. This allowed characterisation of the biochemical properties of FRI and FRL1. Interaction studies between FRI and FRL1, and the zinc finger protein SUPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA 4 (SUF4), were also carried out. Polyclonal antibodies against FRI and FRL1, made during this study, were useful for protein detection in these experiments. The interaction studies, together with plant complementation experiments, suggest that the C-terminus of FRI is essential for protein function, while the N-terminus improves FRI activity. These findings provide a better understanding of how the components of the proposed "FRI-complex" may interact to promote FLC expression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">biochemistry</field><field name="subject">flowering of plants</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">genetic  repressors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090515.110026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of molecular interactions with molecularly imprinted polymers</field><field name="creator">Myint, Mo Aung</field><field name="description">Currently, very little information is available for an in-depth understanding of the molecular binding interactions with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). To address this issue MIPs that have high binding affinities for their template compounds were made so that the nature of these interactions could be elucidated using spectroscopic techniques. 
 12 functional MIPs were prepared using a series of azobenzene and anthracenyl derivatives as the templates. Affinities of these MIPs for the corresponding templates and analogues were determined by performing batch and competitive binding tests. It was found that extensively conjugated compounds that contain at least two OH groups, an electron-withdrawing substituent and have limited conformational freedom were effective templates. 
 The most efficient MIP, M34, was prepared with 4-[(4-nitrophenyl)azo]-1,2-benzenediol (12). M34 exhibited high affinities for azobenzene derivatives of catechol, and bound those that did not contain non electron-withdrawing substituents more specifically. M34 did not lose affinity for 12 in the presence of analogues, and vice versa, in competitive binding tests. These observations suggested a distribution of different binding sites on M34. 
 M34 bound substrates rapidly, which was attributed to its highly porous polymer matrix giving ready access to binding sites. Formation of the porous matrix was facilitated by the use of DMF as the porogen in the preparation of M34. DMF is not a conventional choice of porogen because use of such highly polar H-bonding solvents is thought to disrupt complexation between template and polymer precursors, which is required for the formation of binding sites. 
 Significant changes in the wavenumbers and the intensities of absorption bands assigned to the catechol substructure of 12 were observed in the FT-Raman spectra of 12 bound to M34. These findings suggested that the catechol substructure was responsible for interactions of 12 with M34 that are critical to rebinding and imprinting. 
 In-situ analyses of dithranol (8) being removed from and bound to its MIP, M23, were performed using ATR-IR spectroscopy. Only one band, assigned to the aromatic substructure of 8, was not obstructed by solvent bands in the spectra of unwashed M23 and washed M23 that was treated with the rebinding solution. The wavenumbers of the corresponding bands in the two spectra were significantly different. This observation suggested that there were differences in the vibrational characteristics of 8 bound to M23 under the two conditions. 
 Evidence was found for H-bonding between OH groups of 8 and C=O group of methacrylic acid using transmission FT-IR spectroscopy. However, no evidence was found that showed significant interactions between 12 and 2-vinylpyridine. Methacrylic acid and 2-vinylpyridine were used as the functional monomers in the preparations of M23 and M34. The FT-IR spectra of mixtures of 12 and 4-vinylpyridine showed three new bands assigned to H-bonded OH stretches. These observations indicated that 4-vinylpyridine H-bonds with 12, and would be a more effective functional monomer than 2-vinylpyridine in the preparation of the MIPs for 12. 
 Titration of 12 with 2-vinylpyridine was analysed by &#65533;H NMR spectroscopy. Only small changes to the signals of the corresponding compounds were observed. This lack of change was attributed to the use of d&#8327;DMF, which would compete against 2-vinylpyridine for H-bonding interactions. 
 The findings made using ATR-IR spectroscopy and FT-Raman were novel because previously reported data on bound templates obtained using the corresponding techniques did not show changes in the vibrational characteristics of templates as they bind to MIPs. This investigation has shown that rebinding and spectroscopic studies can provide information about the nature of the binding interactions in MIPs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular imprinting</field><field name="subject">chemical templates</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090617.131516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast, accurate pitch detection tools for music analysis</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Philip</field><field name="description">Precise pitch is important to musicians. We created algorithms for real-time pitch detection that generalise well over a range of single &#65533;voiced&#65533; musical instruments. A high pitch detection accuracy is achieved whilst maintaining a fast response using a special normalisation of the autocorrelation (SNAC) function and its windowed version, WSNAC. Incremental versions of these functions provide pitch values updated at every input sample. A robust octave detection is achieved through a modified cepstrum, utilising properties of human pitch perception and putting the pitch of the current frame within the context of its full note duration. The algorithms have been tested thoroughly both with synthetic waveforms and sounds from real instruments. A method for detecting note changes using only pitch is also presented. 
 Furthermore, we describe a real-time method to determine vibrato parameters - higher level information of pitch variations, including the envelopes of vibrato speed, height, phase and centre offset. Some novel ways of visualising the pitch and vibrato information are presented.

The kakapo (Strigops habroptilus, Gray 1845) is a critically endangered, lek breeding, flightless nocturnal parrot endemic to New Zealand. In April 1998, a total population of fifty-six kakapo was known to survive on offshore islands. Twenty-six kakapo, thirteen males and thirteen females, were temporarily transferred to Pearl Island (518 ha), southern Stewart Island, from April 1998 to April 1999. The translocation of kakapo to Pearl Island, and subsequent breeding season, provided an ideal experimental framework to study kakapo dispersal, movement patterns, home range development, habitat selection, and lek development during the non-breeding and breeding seasons. A total of 4425 radio locations were analysed for all twenty-six birds, with a mean error polygon of 0.03 ha and an estimated average radio telemetry error of 21.6 m. 
 Various home range analysis techniques were used to estimate kakapo home range size and overlap including: minimum convex polygons (MCP), modified minimum convex polygons (MMCP), harmonic mean analysis, adaptive kernel methods and cluster analysis. Estimates of kakapo home range size differed significantly depending on the method used (ANOVA, general linear model: F&#8321;&#8323;, &#8321;&#8320;&#8327;&#8326; = 63.99, p &lt; 0.0001) and the season (F&#8322;, &#8321;&#8320;&#8327;&#8326; = 160.75, p &lt; 0.0001). Breeding home range size was significantly larger than non-breeding range size (mean difference = 67.6 ha, t&#8322;&#8325; = 15.27, p &lt; 0.0001). Calculations from 100% MCP and 95% harmonic mean analysis resulted in larger estimates of home range size and overlap compared to other methods. Cluster and kernel analyses appeared to give the most accurate home range representation for kakapo. Core home range areas showed a greater degree of similarity between methods. Male and female mean annual home range size did not differ significantly, whereas males had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) larger home ranges than females during the nonbreeding season. Minimum convex polygons and harmonic mean analysis suggested that there was no significant difference in the way in which males and females interacted with each other. Kernel and cluster analyses indicated that females would overlap a greater proportion of another bird&#65533;s home range than males would. Cluster analysis also indicated that a female would have more of her home range occupied by another bird than a male would. The fact that different methods produced different quantitative results is an important consideration when using home range analysis to make conservation management decisions. Researchers must determine which method is the most appropriate for a particular research objective, species, or study area. 
 The application of geographical information systems, ERDAS image classification techniques and global positioning systems was an integral part of this study. A large-scale vegetation classification map of Pearl Island was produced in order to quantify habitat selection by kakapo. The unsupervised classification technique produced the least accurate vegetation map, with an accuracy measure of 17-23%, compared to 52% for the supervised classification. The highest accuracy was obtained using an integrated approach involving inductive classification and deductive mapping, resulting in a vegetation classification map which correctly classified 95% of vegetation samples. Thirty-seven ecotone classes were identified and a total ecotone length of approximately 124 km was detected. 
 Resource selection ratios and resource selection functions were estimated using a combination of discrete, continuous and area-based habitat variables. Circular buffers around used and available point locations were generated to determine whether kakapo selectively use vegetation mosaics. The probability of selection increased with increasing species diversity in each 75-metre radius buffer. Kakapo selected habitat mosaics and vegetation types with higher species diversity and moderate to high abundance of mature rimu and yellow silver pine trees.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kakapo</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">home range</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="subject">wildlife relocation</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pearl Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090409.135626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterosynaptic metaplasticity in area CA1 of the hippocampus</field><field name="creator">Hulme, Sarah R</field><field name="description">Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an activity-dependent increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission. In concert with long-term depression (LTD), this synaptic plasticity likely underlies some types of learning and memory. It has been suggested that for LTP/LTD to act as effective memory storage mechanisms, homeostatic regulation is required. This need for plasticity regulation is incorporated into the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) theory by a threshold determining LTD/LTP induction, which is altered by the previous history of activity (Bienenstock et al., 1982). The present work aimed to test key predictions of the BCM model. This was done using field and intracellular recordings in area CA1 of hippocampal slices from young, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The first prediction tested was that following a strong, high-frequency priming stimulation all synapses on primed cells will show inhibition of subsequent LTP and facilitation of LTD induction (heterosynaptic metaplasticity). This was confirmed using two independent Schaffer collateral pathways to the same CA1 pyramidal cells. Following priming stimulation to one pathway, LTP induction was heterosynaptically inhibited and LTD facilitated. To more fully investigate whether all synapses show metaplastic changes, the priming stimulation was given in a different dendritic compartment, in stratum oriens, prior to LTP induction in stratum radiatum. This experiment supported the conclusion that all synapses show inhibited LTP following priming. A second prediction of the BCM model is that metaplasticity induction is determined by the history of cell firing. To investigate this, cells were hyperpolarized during priming to completely prevent somatic action potentials. Under these conditions inhibitory priming of LTP was still observed, and thus somatic action potentials are not critical for the induction of the effect. The next aim was to determine the mechanism underlying heterosynaptic metaplasticity. One way in which plasticity induction can be altered is through changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition of pyramidal cells. For this reason, it was tested whether blocking all GABAergic inhibition, for the duration of the experiment, would prevent priming of LTP. However, priming inhibited subsequent LTP and it was concluded that GABAergic changes do not underlie either the induction, or expression, of the metaplastic state. Proposed revisions to the BCM model predict that postsynaptic elevations in intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314; determine the induction of metaplasticity. There are many potential sources for postsynaptic Ca&#65533;&#8314; elevations, including entry through N-methyl-D-asparate receptors (NMDARs) or voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), or release from intracellular stores. Results of the present work demonstrate that the inhibition of LTP is dependent on the release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from intracellular stores during priming; however this release is not triggered by Ca&#65533;&#8314; entry through NMDARs or VDCCs, or via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Overall, the present results show that, in accordance with the BCM model, a high level of prior activity induces a cell-wide metaplastic state, such that LTD is facilitated and LTP is inhibited. In contrast to predictions of the BCM model, this is not mediated by cell-firing during priming. Instead the release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from intracellular stores is critical for induction of the metaplastic state.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuroplasticity</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">cerebral cortex</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090818.161738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography of the kelp genus Durvillaea (Phaeophyceae: Fucales)</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Ceridwen</field><field name="description">Durvillaea, a kelp genus occurring only in the Southern Hemisphere, presents an ideal system for studies of marine connectivity and postglacial recolonisation. Durvillaea contains five currently-recognised species, four of which are non-buoyant. Whereas all non-buoyant species are restricted to the south-western Pacific, the sole buoyant species (D. antarctica) has a far wider, circumpolar distribution, strongly suggesting that long-distance dispersal in D. antarctica is achieved by rafting. This contrast in predicted dispersal ability among Durvillaea species provides an opportunity for natural phylogeographic comparisons, thereby assessing the effectiveness of rafting as a long-distance dispersal mechanism. Additionally, the inability of D. antarctica to survive in ice-affected areas, combined with its broad distribution, make it an ideal candidate for studies of postglacial recolonisation.
Phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Durvillaea were here assessed using sequence data from mitochondrial (COI), chloroplast (rbcL) and nuclear (18S) DNA. Genetic data were obtained from more than 500 specimens, including representatives from across the geographic range of each recognised species of Durvillaea. Mitochondrial data for Durvillaea were found to be highly phylogenetically informative, with 117 variable sites observed over a 629 bp fragment of COI. Chloroplast and nuclear markers, on the other hand, showed less variation than COI, but nonetheless contributed useful phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches.
Contrasting patterns of genetic diversity were observed across the range of D. potatorum in Australia, with genetic homogeneity throughout western sites versus relatively high levels of diversity in eastern populations. Based on these results, I hypothesise that D. potatorum recolonised much of the western part of its range postglacially, perhaps being entirely eliminated from western Tasmania during the last glacial period by altered oceanographic systems. Additionally, 'western' and 'eastern' D. potatorum haplotypes formed deeply-divergent clades, likely reflecting geographic isolation on either side of the Bassian Isthmus during Pleistocene marine regressions.
Substantial genetic diversity was observed across the range of the circumpolar species D. antarctica. Within New Zealand, phylogenetic and morphological analyses of D. antarctica indicate that two morphotypes ('cape' and 'thonged' forms) likely represent reproductively isolated species, with the 'cape' lineage apparently restricted to southern New Zealand. Whereas the 'cape' lineage showed little genetic variation throughout its range, the 'thonged' lineage exhibited marked phylogeographic structure, with high genetic diversity and a clear north - south genetic disjunction delineated by the Canterbury Bight.
On a broader, circumpolar scale, D. antarctica showed contrasting patterns of genetic diversity, with high levels of variation in low-latitude regions (e.g., continental coasts of New Zealand and Chile), versus near-homogeneity at high, subantarctic latitudes. These phylogeographic contrasts strongly suggest that D. antarctica recolonised much of the subantarctic region only recently, most plausibly following extirpation by ice scour at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Locations of putative recolonised islands relative to 'refugial' areas indicate that Antarctic sea ice was likely more extensive at the LGM than previous studies have suggested.
Latitudinal contrasts in genetic diversity were also observed among Chilean populations of D. antarctica, with a single mitochondrial haplotype detected throughout Chilean Patagonia versus high diversity in central Chile (32&#65533;-42&#65533;S). The Patagonian populations appear to have recolonised the region postglacially, following recession of the Patagonian Ice Sheet after the LGM. These populations show transoceanic ancestry, with a closer relationship to populations in the subantarctic and southern New Zealand regions than to those in central Chile. Substantial phylogeographic structure was evident across small spatial scales in central Chile, and the correspondence of major genetic disjunctions among central Chilean sites with the presence of long stretches of unsuitable substrate (beaches) strongly suggests that habitat discontinuity drives genetic isolation in this dispersive species.
Broad-scale molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that the current taxonomy of Durvillaea species requires substantial revision. Previously-recognised 'morphotypes' of Durvillaea (of D. potatorum in Australia, and D. antarctica in New Zealand), for example, were here found to be genetically distinct, likely representing reproductively-isolated species.
This phylogeographic research on Durvillaea kelp sheds new light on the historical impacts of climate change on Southern Hemisphere marine environments, and on the processes driving evolution in a marine macroalga.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fucales</field><field name="subject">kelps</field><field name="subject">brown algae</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Durvillaea</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091002.131226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maritime Piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, 1992-2006: A Prismatic Interpretation of Security</field><field name="creator">c.liss@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Southeast Asia and Bangladesh are at present global hot-spots of pirate attacks on merchant vessels and fishing boats. This thesis explains why, and in what form, piracy still exists. It will argue that an examination of contemporary piracy is important because it can be understood as both a symptom and a reflection of a range of geo-political and socio-economic problems and security concerns.

The thesis examines pirate attacks on small craft, including fishing boats, and merchant vessels in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh between 1992 and 2006. It describes the different types of contemporary pirate attacks, identifies piracy hot-spots, and looks at the various kinds of pirates active in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Furthermore, it discusses a number of factors which have contributed to the shaping of modern day piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh. Issues examined in this regard include the impact of ecological degradation and over-fishing on the occurrence of piracy; loop-holes and shortcomings in maritime laws and regulations that are conducive to the operations of pirates; the involvement of transnational crime syndicates and radical politically motivated groups in piracy; and the problems with state and private responses to pirate attacks. 

It will be argued that the examination of these factors reveals not only how they shape piracy, but that they also have an impact upon security well beyond pirate attacks. Examining piracy in this way is akin to looking through a prism, allowing a critical gaze to be cast over a range of political, social, and ecological developments, as well as security risks, and their impact on the lives and circumstances of people in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, and the wider international community. It will be suggested that piracy and the various responses to it both reflect political and social developments within countries, and co-operation, tension and friction between states. Additionally, it will be demonstrated that the occurrence of pirate attacks in a region or a country indicates the existence of a wide range of traditional and non-traditional security risks, which can have far reaching repercussions for individuals, nations, or the international community. Through the examination of piracy in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh, and the responses it triggers, important new trends and practices in the security sector are also identified, including the increasing privatisation of security and protection services around the globe.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maritime Piracy</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Crime</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080218.120400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of giardia and cryptosporidium infections in feedlot cattle in Western Australia and Alberta, Canada</field><field name="creator">brenda.ralston@gov.ab.ca</field><field name="description">A comparative study of the parasites Cryptosporidium andersoni and Giardia duodenalis in feedlot cattle in Western Australia (n=502) and Alberta, Canada (n=852) was conducted. The objectives were to determine the prevalence, infection patterns and impact on cattle performance of these protozoan parasites. Utilizing molecular tools G. duodenalis was genotyped and C. andersoni samples were confirmed positive.

C. parvum was absent from all cattle sampled in Alberta, Canada and Western Australia, likely due to the advanced age of the cattle being sampled (6-36 months of age). No C. bovis or C. ryanae were observed in the study cattle. 

C. andersoni was present in 25% of the groups of feedlot cattle sampled in Western Australia with a prevalence range of 0-26% and in all 3 of the Alberta, Canada study groups with a prevalence range of 2.9-12%. All three Alberta, Canada studies collected performance data, however, there was no significant difference between infected and non-infected steers&#146; ADG in the feedlot.

G. duodenalis was present in 83% of the groups sampled in Western Australia with prevalence ranging from 0&#150;22% and all three study groups sampled in Alberta, Canada were positive with a prevalence ranging from 39&#150;82%. The prevalence of G. duodenalis is significantly higher in the Alberta, Canada studies as compared to the Western Australia studies, probably due to climatic factors.

Molecular characterization of a small number of the Alberta, Canada G. duodenalis positive samples (10) revealed 30% (3) genotype A, and 70% (7) genotype E. The same characterization of the Western Australia samples (10) showed 20%(2) genotype A, 40% (4) genotype E, 10% (1) genotype B, 10% (1) genotype C, 10% (1) genotype D and 10% (1) genotype B and E. Due to the unusual finding of genotypes C and D in cattle on such a small number of samples this result should be further studied to either confirm or refute the existence of genotypes C and D in cattle. Based on these results 30% of the animals from Alberta, Canada have the potential to be zoonoti (genotypes A and B) and 40% from the Western Australia studies.

The results of this study demonstrate that C. andersoni and G. duodenalis are prevalent in the study feedlot cattle in Western Australia and Alberta, Canada however the impact of these parasites was not negative on animal performance in the Alberta, Canada studies where it was measured.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryptosporidium</field><field name="subject">Giardia</field><field name="subject">Feedlot Cattle</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091117.124124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroponics system for wastewater treatment and reuse in horticulture</field><field name="creator">nora_oyama@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">As human population increases, the need for water increases in domestic, agricultural, industrial and urban sectors. Wastewater reuse after treatment is gaining acceptance world wide, as availability of fresh water sources decreases. However, it is also important to point out social and cultural differences that still exist in different pars of the world including those where reuse of wastewater for food production or any domestic use is not yet acceptable. The major concerns with effluent reuse are primarily its impact on human health and environmental risk. As a result, effluent reuse should be undertaken with caution after careful consideration of the potential impacts and risks.

This thesis examined the potential to use the hydroponics nutrient film technique to grow commercially important crops using secondary-treated domestic wastewater. The crops chosen were a fruit crop (Lycopersicon esculantum - tomato), a leafy crop (Beta vulgaris ssp. cicla - silver beet) and a flower crop (Dianthus caryophyllus - carnation). Secondary-treated domestic wastewater was chosen because of the reduced risk of pathogen and heavy metal contamination in the crops and due to the guideline requirements for use of treated effluent for food crops. The possibility of using the effluent after the hydroponics treatment for further irrigation was also studied.

The ability of secondary-treated effluent to supply adequate nutrients to the crops was assessed relative to a commercially available hydroponics solution (Chapter 3). The amount of time the solution was left in the system (nutrient solution retention time) was dependant on the plant uptake of the solution. The results obtained showed that the nutrients in secondary treated effluent was adequate for the carnations, but not for the food crops. The food crops from both treatments were compared to the produce purchased from a supermarket. The food crops showed signs of nutrient deficiency, particularly nitrogen.

Based on the findings of the first experiment, the nutrient solution retention time was amended to 14 days. The carnations were not tested with the shorter nutrient solution retention time (NSRT) because they performed well in the previous trial with the longer nutrient solution retention time. The edible food crops performed better and did not show signs of nutrient deficiency when the nutrient solution retention time was reduced to 14 days.

Further statistical analysis was conducted with the data from Chapters 3 and 4. Nutrient and water balances were calculated and the possible reason that the plants grown in the 14-day nutrient solution retention time took up more water, was a result of increased nutrients and better growth. A simple model was constructed to calculate height of the plants using multiple regression. The model was validated against the data collected from this study.

The experiment conducted in Chapter 6 determined the nutritional quality of the food crops. The harvests from the wastewater and commercially available hydroponics solution were compared to produce purchased from a supermarket and tested for total caroteniods, total soluble solids and ascorbic acid concentrations. The nutritional quality of the wastewater grown produce was comparable to those grown in the hydroponic solution and those purchased.

The risk of pathogen contamination to food crops and the die-off of pathogens in the hydroponic channels were studied in Chapter 7. This was tested by spiking the commercial hydroponic medium with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and monitoring bacterial pathogen die-off in the secondary treated domestic wastewater. The pathogen quality of the crop was tested in all treatments as well as on organically grown produce found at a local supermarket. The results of this experiment did not show any contamination on the surface of the food crops or within the food crops.

This study demonstrated that growing tomatoes, silver beet and carnations using secondary-treated domestic wastewater was successful when the nutrient solution retention time was adjusted to the optimum level. In arid, developing and remote communities, this system is ideal as it conserves and reuses water for commercially important crops without compromising the health of the environment or of human beings. It can also be implemented in urban areas, as the system can be scaled according to the availability of space. In addition to this, the effluent after going through this system can be used for open irrigation as it meets the World Health Organisation guidelines.

However, a number of additional concerns need further investigation. They include the transmission risk of other types of pathogen, which depends on the source of wastewater, and the effects of hormones and antibiotics on food crops and their effect on human health.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wastewater reuse</field><field name="subject">hydroponics</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091117.125236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of techniques to classify marine benthic habitats using hyperspectral imagery in oligotrophic, temperate waters</field><field name="creator">matt@harves.net</field><field name="description">There is an increasing need for more detailed knowledge about the spatial distribution and structure of shallow water benthic habitats for marine conservation and planning.  This, linked with improvements in hyperspectral image sensors provides an increased opportunity to develop new techniques to better utilise these data in marine mapping projects.  The oligotrophic, optically-shallow waters surrounding Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provide a unique opportunity to develop and apply these new mapping techniques.  The three flight lines of HyMap hyperspectral data flown for the Rottnest Island Reserve (RIR) in April 2004 were corrected for atmospheric effects, sunglint and the influence of the water column using the Modular Inversion and Processing System.  A digital bathymetry model was created for the RIR using existing soundings data and used to create a range of topographic variables (e.g. slope) and other spatially relevant environmental variables (e.g. exposure to waves) that could be used to improve the ecological description of the benthic habitats identified in the hyperspectral imagery.  A hierarchical habitat classification scheme was developed for Rottnest Island based on the dominant habitat components, such as Ecklonia radiata or Posidonia sinuosa.  A library of 296 spectral signatures at HyMap spectral resolution (~15 nm) was created from &gt;6000 in situ measurements of the dominant habitat components and subjected to spectral separation analysis at all levels of the habitat classification scheme.  A separation analysis technique was developed using a multivariate statistical optimisation approach that utilised a genetic algorithm in concert with a range of spectral metrics to determine the optimum set of image bands to achieve maximum separation at each classification level using the entire spectral library.  These results determined that many of the dominant habitat components could be separated spectrally as pure spectra, although there were almost always some overlapping samples from most classes at each split in the scheme.  This led to the development of a classification algorithm that accounted for these overlaps.  This algorithm was tested using mixture analysis, which attempted to identify 10 000 synthetically mixed signatures, with a known dominant component, on each run. The algorithm was applied directly to the water-corrected bottom reflectance data to classify the benthic habitats.   At the broadest scale, bio-substrate regions were separated from bare substrates in the image with an overall accuracy of 95% and, at the finest scale, bare substrates, Posidonia, Amphibolis, Ecklonia radiata, Sargassum species, algal turf and coral were separated with an accuracy of 70%.  The application of these habitat maps to a number of marine planning and management scenarios, such as marine conservation and the placement of boat moorings at dive sites was demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">hyperspectral</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">habitat mapping</field><field name="subject">Rottnest Island</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091118.110704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of Samson Fish Seriola hippos with emphasis on the sportfishery in Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">andrew@recfishwest.org.au</field><field name="description">This thesis had two overriding aims.  The first was to describe the biology of Samson Fish Seriola hippos and therefore extend the knowledge and understanding of the genus Seriola.  The second was to uses these data to develop strategies to better manage the fishery and, if appropriate, develop catch-and-release protocols for the S. hippos sportfishery.  

Trends exhibited by marginal increment analysis in the opaque zones of sectioned S. hippos otoliths, together with an otolith of a recaptured calcein injected fish, demonstrated that these opaque zones represent annual features.  Thus, as with some other members of the genus, the number of opaque zones in sectioned otoliths of S. hippos are appropriate for determining age and growth parameters of this species.  Seriola hippos displayed similar growth trajectories to other members of the genus.  Early growth in S. hippos is rapid with this species reaching minimum legal length for retention (MML) of 600mm TL within the second year of life.  After the first 5 years of life growth rates of each sex differ, with females growing faster and reaching a larger size at age than males.  Thus, by 10, 15 and 20 years of age, the predicted fork lengths (and weights) for females were 1088 (17 kg), 1221 (24 kg) and 1311 mm (30 kg), respectively, compared with 1035 (15 kg), 1124 (19 kg) and 1167 mm (21 kg), respectively for males.  Despite these differences, female and male S. hippos attained similar maximum age, i.e. 29 (1470 mm FL) and 28 years (1280 mm FL), respectively.  The maximum age determined for S. hippos is greater than that recorded for any other Seriola spp.  The largest female and male S. hippos recorded during this study were encountered during the tagging component and had fork lengths of 1600 mm and 1380 mm, respectively.

Seriola hippos has a protracted spawning period, ca four months, which starts in late spring and continues through summer into early autumn during which time many individuals engage in large spawning aggregations on the lower west coast of Australia. The length at which 50 % of the females in the population reached maturity was 831 mm FL (888 mm TL) and approximately 4 years of age, whilst all females over 950 mm FL were mature.  Whilst aggregated for spawning S. hippos ceases feeding, however, during the non-spawning period this species can best be described as an opportunistic carnivore which feeds on a variety of pelagic and demersal prey.

This study has greatly increased our understanding of S. hippos movement on the west and south coasts of Australia and has documented, for the first time, the migratory behaviour of a carangid in these waters.  Many S. hippos individuals undertake long distance migrations to join spawning aggregation sites near Rottnest Island.  Individuals tagged at these aggregation sites where recaptured throughout this species distribution along the south coast of Australia, some after travelling distances of over 2400 km.  Many S. hippos individuals displayed strong temporal and spatial spawning ground fidelity as numerous fish released at the spawning aggregations were recaptured at the exact same spawning site at similar times in subsequent years.  Tagging data suggest that on the completion of spawning S. hippos individuals return to a resident location and remain in that general vicinity over the winter months.  

This study has developed a hypothesis describing larval dispersal associated with the S. hippos spawning behaviour exhibited near Rottnest Island.  It is proposed that variations in the prevailing ocean currents, at this important spawning location throughout the protracted spawning period, leads to high intra and inter-annual variation in larval distribution and survival.  The affect of this variation on the evolution of the spawning and migratory behaviour displayed by S. hippos is discussed.

A recent increase in the popularity of S. hippos as a catch-and-release sportfish has led to concerns by some anglers about post release survival of this species, particularly due to the depth of capture.  Short term mortality of S. hippos capture at the sportfishing sites was assessed by monitoring fish held within an enclosure near the site of capture for up to 31 hours post release.  The total hooking mortality of S. hippos subjected to catch-and-release angling within the Rottnest Island sportfishery is approximately 8%.  Most of this observed mortality is delayed and occurs sometime after release.  Although best handling practises require ongoing development, the current level of mortality associated with this catch-and-release fishery is considered acceptable.  Furthermore, this mortality is likely to have little effect on the S. hippos population due to the high abundance of this species and the fact that even the highest fishing effort yields a relatively low catch.  Seriola hippos exhibits a typical teleost neuroendocrine stress response associated with catch-and-release.  The physiological dysfunction associated with the stress of capture in this species does not appear to cause any post release mortality.  Instead, most mortality was attributable to barotrauma, however, although mortality in S. hippos increases with capture depth, this species is much less susceptible to depth induced mortality than other commonly targeted species in which barotrauma has been observed.

This study developed key handling protocols for fishers who catch-and-release S. hippos at the Rottnest Island aggregation sites.  These protocols cover aspects of catch-and-release fishing such as hook type, water depth, time at surface, release method and shark predation.

Almost all S. hippos observed during capture from deep water released large quantities of gas from the opercular region, particularly during the last 10 to 20 m before reaching the surface.  This phenomenon has also been witnessed by divers and fishers to occur under natural conditions.  Investigations into this release of gas revealed this physoclistous species to exhibit unique swim bladder characteristics.  Seriola hippos possess a membranous tube that connects the posterior-dorsal surface of the swim bladder internally to a region under each operculum externally.  This connection, termed the swim bladder vent, allows the escape of expanding swim bladder gases on rapid ascent.  The presence of the swim bladder vent provides an explanation as to why the incidence of external barotrauma symptoms in S. hippos captured from the deepwater was low.  The ability to expel excess swim bladder gases during rapid ascent whilst retaining full swim bladder function is likely to offer this semi-pelagic species considerable advantages when hunting prey, avoiding predators and engaging in spawning activities.

Preliminary estimates of total mortality indicated that S. hippos is not currently subjected to a high level of fishing pressure.  However, managers must remain mindful of the fact that the size at which females reach sexual maturity, i.e. 888 mm TL, is greater than the current minimum legal length, i.e. 600 mm, and thus fishers are currently allowed to harvest sexually immature fish.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of future conservation measures must consider the large scale migration and spawning strategy undertaken by this species in order to ensure its protection.  

The collaborative research approach undertaken during this study demonstrated that a high level of community engagement produced a large amount of research interest, increased stakeholder satisfaction from project input, improved understanding of research outcomes, and increased research uptake, all of which has led to increased stewardship and conservation of the S. hippos fishery and fisheries resources in general.  Indeed, projects of this nature would not be possible without this type of approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Seriola</field><field name="subject">fisheries management</field><field name="subject">recreational fishing</field><field name="subject">catch-and-release</field><field name="subject">spawning aggregation</field><field name="subject">Rottnest Island</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091120.110541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays in the Development, Methodology and Policy Prescriptions of Neoclassical Distribution Theory</field><field name="creator">p.flatau@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of revised versions of five published papers on the development of neoclassical distribution theory, in the English-speaking world together with an introduction and conclusion, which draw together the themes of the papers. The thesis covers the origins of neo-classical distribution theory in the English-speaking world in the work of Jevons and Marshall, through to the second generation of Wicksteed, Clark and Pigou, and finally on to the 1930s and the new perspectives of Hicks and Robinson.

Drawing on archival sources and primary and secondary texts, these essays review the major statements on distribution theory made by key figures in the Jevonian and Marshallian marginalist traditions. The essays shed new light on the origins of neoclassical distribution theory and provide insights into the methodology of nascent neoclassical distribution theory. A drive towards a universal, all-embracing marginal productivity theory of the distribution of income characterises the work of Clark and Wicksteed, but not so Marshall. A formalist mode of analysis, which was to become the hallmark of neoclassical economics in the second half of the twentieth century, is also evident in key works of the period. However, the role of empirical evidence in theory generation and appraisal remains an undeveloped component of late nineteenth and early twentieth century neoclassical theory&#151;Marshall again provides an exception to the general rule.

There is a common adherence, among the key figures examined, to the joint proposition that competitive market wage outcomes are &#145;fair&#146;, but that low incomes (fair or not) are unjust when they fail to meet minimum needs standards. State remedial action (tax and expenditure policies) is required to remove such injustices. Robinson&#146;s theory of exploitation provided an important extension to the neoclassical normative framework. She highlighted the extent to which labour may be exploited due to imperfections in both product and labour markets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neoclassical</field><field name="subject">Methodogogy</field><field name="subject">History of economic thought</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Distribution theory</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091123.135256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for capacity development: closing the gap between theory and practice</field><field name="creator">d.boyd@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Capacity development has long been considered a cornerstone of development. While the development industry&#146;s commitment to capacity development has been fraught with debate about its ambiguous nature and lack of associated success, after more than thirty years of experience, there is now widespread agreement that capacity development is a priority for development. There is also renewed understanding that an alternative development paradigm is at the core of capacity development and core principles and good practice guidelines are emerging. However, while there has been a transformation in thinking, much of the development industry is entrenched in existing practices and there remains a gap between the theory that is espoused and capacity development in practice.

Currently, the development industry is in transition. This transition is necessary and unavoidable if the development challenges faced by billions of people are to be addressed. This research sought to identify ways to facilitate this transition and close the gap between theory and practice. The research was underpinned by a pragmatic philosophical perspective. As such, a central aim of the research was to make a practical contribution to improving practice. 

A design-based research methodology was used to carry out research into the practice of delivering two capacity development interventions: 1) the Public Sector Linkages Program (PSLP) Project; and, 2) the Sustainable Sanitation and Wetlands Technology (SSWT) Project.  These interventions were designed to develop Indonesian capacity in water and sanitation. In design-based research, practice and research are carried out concurrently. This methodology provided an opportunity to advance understanding of the relationship between capacity development theory based on the alternative paradigm and improved practice. 

A Framework for Capacity Development is the main outcome of this research. The Framework provides specific guidance regarding the design of capacity development interventions based on the alternative paradigm. The Framework was found to facilitate the design of interventions with improved processes and outcomes. Further application of the Framework in different contexts is recommended.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Capacity development</field><field name="subject">capacity building</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">sanitation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100104.110337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenthood and Civilisation: An Analysis of Parenting Discourses Produced in Australia in the Inter-War Years.</field><field name="creator">rachaelkitchens@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates parent education literature produced in Australia in the inter-war years.  This period saw the emergence of various organisations concerned to safeguard and protect the health and well-being of children.  For example, infant health clinics were established in most states, kindergarten associations were active in promoting early childhood education, and the mental hygiene movement gained a foothold in Australia.  These associations engaged in parent education activities and produced a growing volume of literature.  This literature contained instructions relating to various aspects of child care.  Initially, advice was directed towards the management of health, but increasingly, information was provided on guiding child behaviour.   Although the care of children was the main focus of this literature, it had wider implications.  Authors provided comment on the emotional structure of family life and the patterning of parent-child relationships.  Importantly, this literature contained advice for parents in relation to the management of their own personal care and conduct.  This thesis contends that these discourses can be explained in relation to long-term changes in the history of childhood and the family, which are connected to particular developments in the structuring of social life that Norbert Elias describes as the &#145;civilizing process&#146;.   In particular, it is argued that the growing distance between children and adults, and the positioning of the family as the primary site for regulating, or &#145;civilizing&#146; the behaviour of children, can help to explicate the increasing emphasis placed on parent education in the inter-war years.   This thesis also demonstrates how an Eliasian analysis, which emphasises long-term unintended processes of change, provides an alternative to Marxist, feminist, and Foucaultian approaches that focus on social control.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">childrearing literature</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">civilising process</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100106.152328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magic causality : the function of metaphor and language in the earlier verse, essays and fictions of Jorge Luis Borges, read as consitutive of a theory of generic incorporation</field><field name="creator">tom_lonie_tefl_teacher@yahoo.co.uk</field><field name="description">Borges saw narrative as the bearer of universally re-combinable elements. Although these elements seem sequential, their essential formal integrity guarantees their rearrangement to generate new narratives. The ficci&#243;n lives beyond its author. However, Borges&#146; ontological anxieties also have a life of their own that undermines the ficci&#243;n&#146;s assimilative potential.

By developing poetic and linguistic insights Borges creates immortal text through the construction of a symbolic repertoire. Each element of the repertoire has its genesis in the author&#146;s personal development. This history is archaeologised in the early poetry and mediated through a theory of metaphor and the reader&#146;s interaction with the text. Borges sees no need for a
Freudian reading theory. Instead he develops an antipsychological poetics. He enlists the reader as a willing participant in the text by a dual strategy of symbolic incorporation. Firstly, readers identify with characters through vicarious emotional prediction. Secondly, he refreshes the reader&#146;s participation by presenting emblematic devices serving as sub-text to enhance symbolic participation. Together these strategies constitute a &#145;magic causality&#146; of negotiated textual interpretation continually operating in his narratives. But the discipline of magic causality also conceals a rhetoric of presence establishing counter-motivational effects to disturb symbolic incorporation at the level of genre.

The dissertation extracts key features for scrutiny from Borges&#146; early literary theory and criticism, elaborating them into a general aesthetic programme. It examines biographical influences in shaping his critical and creative work. It problematises his texts from the point of view of his ideas about linguistics, their identity as contributions to the genre of the ficci&#243;n, and the centrality of metaphor and analogy as interpretative strategies. I use a number of approaches for this enterprise, including biographical criticism (ontological preoccupations), substitutional analysis (temporal subjectivity), linguistic interpretation (theory of metaphor), literary criticism (readerly reception), structuralism (readerly incorporation), and deconstruction (rhetoric of suppression). The dissertation pragmatically investigates, and contests, Borges&#146; assimilative poetics of textual presence.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magic causality</field><field name="subject">ficcion</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">metaphor</field><field name="subject">symbolic repertoire</field><field name="subject">intellectual biography</field><field name="subject">poetics</field><field name="subject">Jorge Luis Borges</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100108.131010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct and Indirect Cognitive and Psychological Consequences of Workplace Neurotoxic Exposure</field><field name="creator">leocoxon@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">Cognitive assessments were conducted on aircraft crew who reported symptoms following exposure to jet oil engine emissions from BAe-146 aircraft. Results demonstrated impairments on tests of reaction time, processing speed and fine motor skills in most participants. Findings were significant but with such a small sample this may not be representative. However if extrapolated across the aviation industry, could indicate significant aviation safety problems. The possibility of consistent neuropsychological impairments with exposure to jet engine emissions indicates a need for more robust studies.
A second study investigated the psychological impact on spouses of aircraft maintenance engineers affected by the toxic chemicals used in the Deseal/Reseal program of F-III aircraft.
Ninety one spouses of affected RAAF workers were administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI); Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI); and Spouse Questionnaire (SQ). Controls were twenty five aged matched spouses of RAAF personnel not involved in the program.
Results demonstrated significant differences between experimental group and controls on PAI Somatic Complaints, Anxiety, Depression, and Stress scales. Spouse Questionnaire of coping skills, demonstrated that the experimental group had significant difficulties coping with spouses. ZBI administered to experimental group only, indicated that their burden of stress was moderate to severe.
Despite limited control group, results were considered significantly robust and statistically significant, which suggested it unlikely that results would have been different, given a larger sample.
In the final study cognitive assessments were conducted on forty two health care workers exposed to the chemical glutaraldehyde. Workers were divided into two experimental groups: EXP1, currently working with glutaraldehyde, with protective measures; EXP2, previously worked with glutaraldehyde with poor protection. Controls were eighteen age matched health care workers, not exposed to glutaraldehyde.
All groups were administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for emotional impact of chemical exposure. Results indicated significant impairments in information processing speed, reaction time and accuracy of responses in experimental groups compared with controls. Differences were more significant in the
extensively exposed EXP2 group, who also had higher elevations on the depression scale of the HADS.
Results demonstrated significant neuropsychological and emotional effects in individuals extensively exposed to glutaraldehyde, using few protective measures, compared with less severely exposed workers or controls. Implications of test results and importance of adherence to health and safety regulations are discussed.
If extrapolated across the health care professions this could indicate occupational health and safety issues in hospitals and clinics, where chemicals are used.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100203.134802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recombinant proteins as vaccines and diagnostic antigens for the control of Jembrana disease virus infection in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">josh.lewis@meddent.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a lentivirus associated with an acute disease syndrome of Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) in Indonesia. Control of Jembrana disease currently involves serological monitoring of infection in endemic areas, restriction of movement of cattle from these areas and ring-vaccination around outbreaks of the disease with a tissue-derived inactivated-virus vaccine. 
Earlier investigations at Murdoch University resulted in a vaccine combining a mix of recombinant capsid (CA) and Tat proteins that ameliorated the clinical signs of JDV infection in vaccinated cattle. This thesis reports the development of an alternative novel fused CA and Tat polyprotein antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund&#146;s adjuvant (IFA) as a vaccine. This polyprotein could be produced in a single operation at a lower cost than the mix of the 2 individually produced recombinant proteins. The effect of vaccination with this CA and Tat polyprotein vaccine was compared to vaccination with a mixture of individual CA and Tat proteins in small groups of cattle that were subsequently challenged with virulent JDV. It was found that the fused polyprotein vaccine elicited a greater antibody response against both the CA and Tat antigens than a vaccine containing the mix of individual recombinant proteins. In cattle vaccinated with the fused recombinant polyprotein the viral load and lymphocyte response to infection was similar to that in cattle vaccinated with the mix of individual proteins.  When the CA and Tat polyprotein vaccine was administered to cattle under field conditions, the vaccine induced minimal side effects and an antibody response to both CA and Tat proteins that persisted for 12 months. 
A recombinant protein antigen was produced for ELISA and Western immunoblotting assays that enabled serological detection.  This antigen provided an alternative to the whole virus antigen that is currently used in Indonesia for these serological assays. The whole virus antigen is prepared from plasma of JDV-infected cattle using a differential centrifugation technique and is difficult to produce in Indonesia. It was found that a recombinant full length CA (p26) protein antigen used in an ELISA provided sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that obtained by Western immunoblotting with the whole virus antigen. This recombinant CA protein antigen is now used in routine serological assays for detection of JDV in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100203.135558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renewing Societies: Interculturalism and the Creative Sojourner</field><field name="creator">ssigler227@gmail.com</field><field name="description">From their nascent beginnings during World War II to their good governance and capacity building focus under the Post-Washington Consensus of the early 21st century, international development activities have encompassed a particular world view. This world view, founded on Western historical materialism and a normative perspective, rationalizes &#147;the project&#148; as the predominate form of development assistance and the &#147;expert&#148; or &#147;volunteer&#148; as its agent. Yet this approach to development, although at times successful, has often proved to be unsustainable in the absence of international financing and expertise.

Still, there is an alternative approach available when one recognizes that what the vast majority of people want is security for themselves, their families, and their lifestyles.1 From this approach, the focus of development is shifted away from what people do not have (be it material comforts, infrastructure, or good governance) and sets it on the critical roles culture, individual growth, and informal association have in community development. In this approach, human agency at the interpersonal level becomes critical in the diffusion of social, political, economic, and technological innovation and, accordingly, the decisive factor in poverty reduction. That is to say, development that can address poverty must come from within the social classes that experience it.

To explore how the international development community can act on this alternative approach, this thesis provides a review of the theory, practice, and consequences of international development to the present day and, from that lead, builds a theoretical argument for the individual creative sojourner as a primary messenger of development. In addition, it presents an exploratory case study of creative sojourners in Timor-Leste and, from their ideas and insights, proposes policy considerations for an overseas apprenticeship program that would support the efforts of trades people, agriculturalists, and small entrepreneurs in improving their lives and, in the process, renewing their societies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international education</field><field name="subject">overseas apprenticeship</field><field name="subject">international aid</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Timor-Leste</field><field name="subject">development industr</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100203.142632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Located Stories: Theatre Makes Place with the Body</field><field name="creator">a.campbell@ballarat.edu.au</field><field name="description">The journey into theatre-made places offered here is both analytical and creative. It is
comprised of case studies analysing three theatre productions that occurred in Perth
between 2004 and 2006 and two of my own creative works, forming the Prologue and
Conclusion to the thesis. Throughout, I am informed by Edward Casey&#146;s philosophy of
place as I work to develop both a poetics and a dramaturgy of place in theatre. I draw
upon of a range of thinkers in order to interrogate the limits of theatrical representation
and to suggest that an active engagement in the process of place-making in theatre
offers a touchstone and paradigm that can release both thought and the body from
totalizing and foreclosing cultural imperatives. This dramaturgical and poetical journey
into place works, I hope, toward creating an open and dynamic field from which to
experience the &#145;here and now&#146; of being in place in theatre, and in the world.
I argue that the notion of place as embodied meaning frames the body and the mind in
contexts that are personal, emotional, historical, ethical, and political; that to be in place,
to be aware that one&#146;s body is a particular place, suggests that the body and mind are
listening to each other. This conscious connection, I believe, offers a radical challenge
to the bifurcation of body and mind that runs as a consistent theme throughout the
history of Western thought. More particularly, I aim to demonstrate that a voyage into
place, in theatre, conveys the body and mind together in ways that allow us to &#147;resume
the direction, and regain the depth, of our individual and collective life once again &#150; and
know it for the first time&#148; (Casey, 1993: 314).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous theatre</field><field name="subject">contemporary performance</field><field name="subject">Australian theatre</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100203.143218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxoplasma gondii in Australian Marsupials</field><field name="creator">Nevi.Parameswaran@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Diagnostic tools were developed and utilised to detect Toxoplasma gondii infection in a range of Australian marsupial species and identify epidemiological trends. An ELISA was developed to detect anti-T. gondii IgG in macropod marsupials. When compared with the commercially available MAT (modified agglutination test), the ELISA was in high agreement and yielded a &#234; coefficient of 0.96. Of 18 western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) tested for the presence of T. gondii DNA by PCR, the 9 ELISA positive kangaroos tested PCR positive and the 9 ELISA negative kangaroos tested PCR negative indicating that the ELISA protocol was both highly specific and sensitive and correlated 100% with the more labour intensive PCR assay.

A T. gondii seroprevalence study was undertaken on free ranging Australian marsupials. There was a T. gondii seroprevalence of 15.5% (95%CI: 10.7-20.3) in western grey kangaroos located in the Perth metropolitan area. The T. gondii seroprevalence in male western grey kangaroos was significantly less than their female counterparts (p=0.038), which may be related to behavioural differences causing differences in exposure to oocysts or recrudescence of T. gondii infection in pregnant females. Marsupial populations located in islands free from felids had a low overall T. gondii seroprevalence. A case control study determined that marsupials located in areas where felids may roam are 14.20 (95%CI: 1.94-103.66) times more likely to be T. gondii seropositive than marsupials located on felid-free islands.

PCR, immunohistochemistry and serological techniques were used to detect T. gondii infection in marsupial dams and their offspring. T. gondii DNA was detected in the pouch young of chronically infected western grey kangaroos and a woylie (Bettongia penicillata). T. gondii DNA was also identified in the mammary gland of the woylie dam suggesting that infection of the woylie pouch young was from suckling milk from the mammary gland. Results of the study demonstrate that vertical transmission of T. gondii occurs in Australian marsupials and may be of importance in the maintenance of T. gondii infection in Australian marsupial populations.

Animal tissue and meat from Australia, predominately from Australian marsupials, were screened for T. gondii DNA using PCR primers for the multi-copy, T. gondii specific B1 gene. Sequencing of the B1 gene revealed atypical genotypes in 7 out of 13 samples from Australia. These 7 isolates contained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the B1 gene that could not be matched with known sequences from strains I, II, III and X. Six unique genotypes were identified out of the 7 atypical isolates; two out of the 7 isolates had the same unique sequence at the B1 gene whereas the other 5 isolates each had different combinations of SNPs at the B1 gene. A majority of T. gondii isolates sampled from native Australian marsupials were of an atypical genotype. The discovery of atypical strains of T. gondii in Australia leads to further questions regarding the origin and transmission of these atypical strains. Additional studies linking atypical strains with their clinical manifestation are also warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxoplasma</field><field name="subject">Vertical transmission</field><field name="subject">kangaroos</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100203.145857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strong and smart: Reinforcing aboriginal perceptions of being aboriginal at Cherbourg state school</field><field name="creator">c.sarra@qut.edu.au</field><field name="description">No Abstract</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State school</field><field name="subject">Cherbourg</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100208.145610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of the ichthyofaunas of offshore waters in different types of estuary in Western Australia, including the biology of Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri</field><field name="creator">B.Chuwen@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis has addressed the following three main areas of research. 1) The physico-chemical characteristics of eight selected estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia that represent different estuary types, 2) the ichthyofaunal characteristics of the basin and riverine regions of offshore, deeper waters of five of those estuaries and 3) aspects of the biology of the iconic Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri in each of those estuaries in which it was abundant. 
Although four of the estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia remain permanently open to the ocean, the others only become open when the volume of river discharge is sufficient to breach the prominent sand bars that form at their mouths. The sand bars of the latter estuaries are breached either annually following heavy winter and early spring rainfall (seasonally-open estuaries) or infrequently after exceptionally heavy discharge (normally-closed estuaries). The work for this thesis was undertaken in the permanently-open Oyster Harbour, the seasonally-open Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets and the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary and Hamersley, Culham and Stokes inlets, which are all located within a ca 500 km stretch of coastline.
In permanently and seasonally-open estuaries, pronounced haloclines and oxyclines were present in their narrow riverine regions, but not in their wide basins where the waters are subjected to wind-driven mixing. The extent of cyclical seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions differed markedly among the three seasonally-open estuaries and between years in one of those systems. These differences reflected variations in the relationship between the volume of fluvial discharge, which is determined by a combination of the amount of local rainfall, catchment size and extent of clearing of native vegetation, and the amount of intrusion by marine waters, which is largely controlled by the size and duration of the opening of the estuary mouth. The mean seasonal salinities in the basins of three of the normally-closed estuaries increased over three years of very low rainfall to 64 in the deepest estuary (Stokes Inlet) to 145 in Hamersley Inlet and to 296 in the shallowest estuary (Culham Inlet). 
Gill netting seasonally for two years at sites in the basin and saline lower reaches of the main tributary of the seasonally-open Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets, the permanently-open Oyster Harbour and the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary yielded 22 329 fishes representing 58 species. Overall, and irrespective of estuary type, the species compositions of the basins and rivers differed markedly. This was attributable to consistently greater abundances of Mugil cephalus, and usually also of A. butcheri, in the riverine region of each estuary and to the restriction of a range of species largely to the basins. However, the ichthyofaunal compositions in the basins of the five estuaries varied markedly, reflecting, in part, differences in the extent and duration of the opening of the estuary mouth and/or whether extensive growths of macrophytes were present. Changes in the ichthyofaunal composition of the normally-closed Wellstead Estuary between the first and second years of the study were attributable, in particular, to the movement of two mugilid species into offshore waters as they increased in size. Cyclical changes in ichthyofaunal composition were conspicuous in both the basin and riverine regions of the estuary that underwent the most pronounced seasonal variations in environmental conditions. In each estuary, species richness was greater in the basin than river, where salinities were more variable and fell to lower levels and were thus less conducive to the immigration of most marine species. Catch rates were least in Broke Inlet, which had the lowest primary productivity, and were particularly high in Wellstead Estuary, which is highly eutrophic. 
The maximum ages of Acanthopagrus butcheri ranged downwards from 13 to 15 years in Wilson Inlet, Wellstead Estuary, Culham Inlet and Stokes Inlet, 9 years in Oyster Harbour and only 5 years in Irwin Inlet and Hamersley Inlet. Growth of A. butcheri varied markedly among the various estuaries, probably reflecting differences in the density of A. butcheri, quality/quantity of food and/or salinity regime. The relationship between fish length and otolith radius varied between sexes and among estuaries. The width of the annual growth zones of otoliths was shown, however, to vary among years, particularly in Stokes Inlet, in which the growth zones were widest in years of relatively high rainfall and thus when salinities were presumably below that of full-strength sea water. The trends exhibited throughout the year by the gonadosomatic indices and the prevalences of each of the sequential stages in gonadal development demonstrate that A. butcheri spawns mainly in spring in estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia. The lengths at maturity (L50s) of A. butcheri in the four estuaries from which it was possible to obtain substantial reproductive data were not significantly different (all p &gt; 0.05), with the values for females, for example, ranging only from 146-161 mm. While no fish matured at the end of their first year of life in those estuaries, the majority of fish did mature at the end of their second year of life (73-100%). The vast majority or all fish were mature by 200 mm, which is well below the minimum legal length (MLL) for retention of this species in Western Australia, thus providing the potential for all fish that survive to the MLL to reproduce before being legally retained. Recruitment of A. butcheri varied markedly among years and estuaries. Recruitment in the seasonally-open Wilson Inlet was greatest in years of below average rainfall and thus presumably also relatively elevated salinities and reduced stratification and associated deoxygenation of the bottom water layer in the rivers. Although massive mortalities of A. butcheri in two of the normally-closed estuaries prevented comparisons across this estuary type, it appears that strong recruitment in these estuaries is related to years of relatively high rainfall and presumably the lowering of salinities in these estuaries to below that of full-strength sea water. Total mortality (Z) of A. butcheri appeared to be slightly higher in estuaries with the greatest fishing pressure.
The species composition and diversity of the diets of A. butcheri in three normally-closed estuaries, i.e. Hamersley, Culham and Stokes inlets, which vary markedly in the extents to which they become hypersaline during dry periods, were compared. Although a wide range of taxa, including macrophytes, polychaetes, molluscs, crustaceans, insects and teleosts, were ingested by A. butcheri in each estuary, the frequencies of ingestion and volumetric dietary contributions of these taxa varied greatly among the fish in these estuaries. Thus, for example, relatively greater contributions were made to the diet by polychaetes and crustaceans in Stokes Inlet, by macrophytes in Hamersley Inlet, and by insects (mainly chironomid larvae) in Culham Inlet. The relatively greater contribution of teleosts to the diets of A. butcheri in the Hamersley and Culham inlets than in Stokes Inlet, and also differences in the main teleost species ingested in the first two estuaries, are consistent with differences in the densities of fish overall and of the main fish species in those estuaries. The diversity of the diet was far greater in Stokes Inlet than in the other two far more variably saline estuaries, presumably reflecting a greater diversity of food. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri in upstream pools in the tributary of Culham Inlet, which offer refuge when salinities increase markedly in the main body of the estuary, differed from those in downstream regions, further emphasising the opportunistic nature of the feeding behaviour of A. butcheri. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri underwent size-related changes, but the taxa contributing most to those changes varied greatly among estuaries. Size-related changes would be particularly beneficial in reducing intraspecific competition for food in the two estuaries that vary greatly in salinity and would thus be likely to contain a less diverse range of prey.
	In summary, this thesis has demonstrated that the physico-chemical characteristics of estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia vary markedly even among estuaries of the same type, i.e. seasonally open and normally closed, and has elucidated the basis for those differences. While the characteristics of the ichthyofaunas in the offshore waters of the various estuaries on that coast differ markedly, those differences were not as marked as the overall difference between the basin and riverine regions of those systems. Finally, the iconic Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri is characterised by very different growth and recruitment patterns in the various estuaries and highly opportunistic feeding behaviour. The great plasticity of A. butcheri helps account for the success of this species in the range of very different environments found in south coast estuaries.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100210.154423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Chinese Civilizing Process: Eliasian Thought as an Effective Analytical Tool for the Chinese Cultural Context</field><field name="creator">A.Stebbins@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis is an effort to apply Elias&#146;s thinking on social development to the Chinese social situation. At first glance his account of the civilizing process would appear incompatible with this context, in that, after state formation with the Qin and Han dynasties beginning in 221 BC, Chinese civilization remained both stable and highly traditional for well over two millennia. It is argued, however, that closer scrutiny reveals a process that was merely interrupted for a considerable period. The traditional system relied upon a symbiotic relationship between local society and the centre whereby the centre remained relatively small and aloof, not interfering with local social relations, as long as local society provided the required taxes and labour. In this situation the state had the monopolies of both violence and taxation that Elias would look for, but left local society to its own devices primarily because it was already pacified. This self-reinforcing system was enshrined and codified in the Confucian cannon over the course of centuries from the Han dynasty. 
Central control of the distribution of resources was eventually required to re-start the Chinese civilizing process, for this was the mechanism through which the local social structure would finally be altered.  This only happened within the past century as the Chinese people struggled to grapple with their own &#145;backwardness&#146; in the face of incessant Western and Japanese incursions. At this point the old system was toppled and replaced by progressively more aggressive central governments who saw as their most important task the destruction of the traditional social order in the interest of modernization. As the Chinese state consciously and forcibly took control of the distribution of resources at all levels of society, traditional social relations were stretched and warped, and the Chinese civilizing process re-commenced its long-stalled march toward modernization. This has been evidenced both by the dramatic growth in mobility and the rapidly extending chains of interdependence in the form of guanxi connections primarily during the Post-Opening period after 1978.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interdependence</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">face</field><field name="subject">internalization</field><field name="subject">constraint</field><field name="subject">Confucius</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100211.123651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psittacine beak and feather disease : vaccination, haematological response and pcr methodology</field><field name="creator">nicolai@bonne.no</field><field name="description">To enable assessment of recombinant BFDV capsid protein (recBFDVcap) for vaccination to protect against PBFD, commercially available lovebirds (Agapornis sp.) were tested for evidence of past and current BFDV infection using PCR, HI and HA to identify suitable BFDV-free birds in which to test the vaccine. During this attempt, it was found that lovebirds from commercial aviaries were endemically infected with BFDV with evidence of up to 100% prevalence of BFDV DNA in blood samples from individual birds over time. Such an approach was abandoned as unlikely to yield suitable numbers of na&#239;ve birds to conduct a BFDV vaccination trial.  

As commercially available lovebirds were considered to be a poor source of BFDV-free birds, wild caught cockatoo nestlings and eggs (long-billed corella; Cacatua tenuirostris and galah; Eolophus roseicapillus) were used to assess the efficacy of BFDV vaccination using baculovirus recombinant BFDV capsid. Eggs were artificially incubated and 3 eggs successfully hatched and 1 was successfully hand-reared. All nestlings were screened for BFDV DNA in blood using PCR upon arrival then on days 11, 18 and 25 and tested for anti-BFDV antibody on the day of arrival. All hatched birds were determined to be free of BFDV DNA and BFDV HI antibody in the peripheral blood throughout the hand rearing period and the flock was considered to be suitable for a BFDV vaccination trial.

Corellas (n=13) were injected with 1 mL of vaccine containing 10 &#956;g recBFDVcap on day 0 and 0.4 mL vaccine containing 66.8 &#956;g recBFDVcap on day 11. All vaccinated corellas and 5 non-vaccinated control corellas were given 0.4 mL BFDV suspension (titre = log2 12 HAU/50 &#956;L) intramuscularly and 0.1 mL orally 16 days after booster vaccination. Blood was collected periodically during the vaccination period and blood and feathers collected before and after BFDV administration. Testing included BFDV DNA detection by PCR and qRT PCR (on blood) as well as serum antibody detection by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and BFDV DNA and antigen was detected by qRT PCR and haemagglutination (HA) (on feathers), respectively. Four of 97 blood samples collected from vaccinated birds post BFDV challenge tested positive by PCR, whereas 17 of 35 samples taken from non-vaccinated control corellas tested positive. Vaccinated birds did not develop feather lesions, had only transient PCR detectable viraemia and had no evidence of persistent infection 270 days post-challenge using PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Non-vaccinated control corellas developed transient feather lesions and PCR, HI and HA test results consistent with PBFD. They were BFDV PCR positive for up to 41 days post-challenge and qRT PCR demonstrated reduced virus replication in vaccinated birds compared to non-vaccinated control birds. Thus, administration of recBFDVcap vaccine alone was found to incite an adaptive immune response in BFDV-free corellas that subsequently conferred protection against inoculation with BFDV.

A commonly utilized method for excising blood dried on filter paper was proven to be of high risk of carryover contamination facilitated by a hole punch used for processing several samples. Therefore a practical method of avoiding carryover contamination was developed and used in the DNA testing procedures of the vaccination trial.

Finally, the haematological characteristics of the above mentioned cockatoos were studied before and for 97 days after experimental infection with BFDV. It was found that the pre-challenge haematological values were similar between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated corellas. Most pre-challenge parameters were comparable to previously reported values of other cockatoos and psittacine birds. Significant differences were seen in both groups when comparing pre-challenge values with post challenge values for total and differential leukocyte concentrations, but PCV and TSP were not significantly affected by BFDV challenge.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BFDV</field><field name="subject">PBFD</field><field name="subject">Psittacine birds</field><field name="subject">Vaccination</field><field name="subject">Haematology</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100211.182512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qohelet's Philosophies of Death</field><field name="creator">kimray@nd.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis arises at the meeting place of a philosophical and a thanatological treatment of the book of Qohelet. A philosophical treatment is defended on the grounds of previous studies of the type of thinking evidenced in the text, as well as a comparison with ancient notions of philosophy which suggest that philosophy concerns the type of questions asked, the method of answering the questions, the answers to the questions, and the purpose of the endeavour. A thanatological treatment is defended both on the grounds of previous studies of the text as well as on the grounds of clear evidence that the text is very concerned with the issue of death. From a philosophical perspective it is assumed the book says something about such themes as beauty, knowledge, states of being, ethics, and the benefits of a philosophical outlook. These philosophical categories are combined with the text&#146;s thanatology. The thesis therefore presents: a death aesthetic, in which death can be beautiful; an epistemology of death, in which we are shown to possess certain knowledge of our own mortality in contrast to the lack of understanding we possess about the events of life; a phenomenology of death, or a study of the state of being dead, in which it is seen that death can only ever be the object of our gaze, and we can never experience our own death; an ethics of death, or more precisely an ethics of suicide, in which it is asked, if suicide is appropriate, under what conditions it is better to be dead than alive; and, finally, the death-based nature of the philosophy itself, in which it is seen that one cannot be wise without thinking on death, and that such thoughts confer a particular sort of life on the wise person.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecclesiastes</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">epistemology</field><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100211.75157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and Function of Leukocytes in the Family Macropodidae</field><field name="creator">k.hulme-moir@vet.gla.ac.uk</field><field name="description">Leukocytes play a central role in protecting the body against infectious organisms and their research is essential for understanding the mechanisms of immunity. By studying leukocytes across a range of species, insights are provided into differing strategies employed to ensure resistance to disease. Surprisingly, the structure and function of marsupial leukocytes has received very limited study. Marsupials represent a major evolutionary pathway with distinct differences in reproduction and development from placental mammals. These differences in the life history of marsupials place unique challenges on the immune system, and differences in leukocyte structure and function could be reasonably expected. In this thesis, studies were undertaken to examine the cytochemical, ultrastructural and functional features of leukocytes from species of marsupials, belonging to the family Macropodidae (kangaroos and wallabies). The aim of these studies was to elucidate the characteristics of macropodid leukocytes and to compare and contrast these features with the known characteristics of other mammalian leukocytes.
	Leukocytes from two species of macropodid, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosis), formed the basis of this study with additional material provided from quokka (Setonix brachyurus), woylie (Bettongia pencillata) and red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). Staining characteristics of cells were examined following reaction with Sudan black B, peroxidase, chloroacetate esterase, naphthyl butyrate esterase, alkaline phosphatase and periodic acid-Schiff. Peroxidase and Sudan Black B reactions were similar to domestic animal species but chloroacetate esterase and naphthyl butyrate esterase were unreliable as markers for macropodid neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Significant variation in staining for alkaline phosphatase was seen between species of macropodid. Tammar wallabies and quokka demonstrated strong neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity whereas western grey kangaroos, red kangaroos and woylies contained no activity within their leukocytes.
	Peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase cytochemistry were also assessed at the ultrastructural level with transmission electron microscopy. This allowed the identification of distinct granule populations within macropodid neutrophils. Two subcellular compartments containing alkaline phosphatase activity were identified within tammar wallaby neutrophils. These were considered equivalent to secretory vesicles and a subpopulation of specific granules. Tubular vesicles containing alkaline phosphatase were also identified within the eosinophils of tammar wallabies. These structures were a novel finding having not been reported previously in the eosinophils of other animal species. 
	In addition to cytochemistry, the general ultrastructure of leukocytes from tammar wallabies and western grey kangaroos were reported. Results were similar to previous reports for other marsupial species. The current body of knowledge was extended by the first detailed description of the ultrastructure of basophils in a marsupial.
	To assess functional aspects of macropdid neutrophils, flow cytometric assays were performed examining oxidative burst responses and phagocytosis. Reactive oxygen species were generated by neutrophils from tammar wallabies and western grey kangaroos in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe or opsonised bacteria. Phagocytosis of opsonised bacteria was also measured in neutrophils from tammar wallabies, which was poor in contrast to ovine neutrophils. However, flow cytometric studies were limited by sample preparation. Further optimisation of isolation methods for tammar wallaby leukocytes should be undertaken before dogmatic conclusions are drawn.
Overall, the results of this thesis demonstrate that, in the areas examined, the general characteristics of leukocyte structure and function of mammals are present in macropodids. However differences were identified both within and outside of the macropodid group. These differences have important ramifications for the use of &#145;model&#146; species in the study of leukocyte biology in marsupials. The results also provide potentially useful tools for the clinical diagnosis of haematological disease in macropodids and may be of interest to those studying comparative and evolutionary aspects of leukocyte structure and function.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leukocytes</field><field name="subject">marsupial</field><field name="subject">Macropodidae</field><field name="subject">cytochemistry</field><field name="subject">transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100211.90101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical Dechlorination of Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene</field><field name="creator">D.James@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCBD) is a toxic aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbon which is widely used as a fungicide, herbicide and heat transformer fluid. HCBD is resistant to microbial degradation and, therefore, persists in aquatic and soil environments worldwide. In this thesis, the ability of non-specific bacteria from various sources to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of either acetate or lactate (as an electron donor) and cyanocobalamin (as an electron shuttle) under different conditions was investigated. Cultivating specific populations to reduce cyanocobalamin as a method to increase HCBD dechlorination rate was investigated. Also, the factors responsible for HCBD dechlorination and the stalling of dechlorination were studied. Lastly, redox potential measurement during the microbial reductive dechlorination of HCBD for online detection of ongoing dechlorination was evaluated.

Findings from the Project
&#132;&#171;	Non-specific bacteria from activated sludge, anaerobic digested effluent from municipal waste, piggery waste and sheep rumen content are able to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of cyanocobalamin to chlorine-free C4 gases in a biochemical reaction.
&#132;&#171;	Dechlorination was equated to the formation of completely dechlorinated end-products from HCBD dechlorination.
&#132;&#171;	Methanogens were found to be involved in HCBD dechlorination.
&#132;&#171;	Mediators rather than specific bacteria were responsible for the fast dechlorination rates. Results suggest that activated sludge may release synthesized mediators into the supernatant to enable enhanced HCBD dechlorination.
&#132;&#171;	HCBD dechlorination can be monitored using oxidation reduction potential (ORP). ORP has an effect on HCBD dechlorination rate.

Scientific Significance/Novelty
The most significant finding from this research is that it demonstrates chlorine-free end-products in contrast with other studies in literature (Booker and Pavlosthasis, 2000; Bosma et al., 1994) where dechlorination was equated with disappearance of HCBD into bacterial biomass and the detection of partially dechlorinated gases such as trichlorobutadiene. It also shows that, in contrast to literature where specific bacteria (i.e., pure strains/cultures) were commonly used for the dechlorination of polychlorinated hydrocarbons, results from this thesis show that non-specific bacteria were able to dechlorinate HCBD in the presence of cyanocobalamin at rates&#131;x sufficiently high to be considered for bioremediation projects. Moreover, results demonstrate that ORP can be used to monitor HCBD dechlorination.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hexachloro-1</field><field name="subject">3-butadiene (HCBD)</field><field name="subject">dechlorination</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">cyanocobalamin</field><field name="subject">redox  potential</field><field name="subject">chlorine-free end-products</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100216.212048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buyers' enduring involvement with online auctions: a New Zealand perspective</field><field name="creator">Abdul-Ghani, Eathar Mohammad</field><field name="description">Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online auctions represent an important new marketplace from which consumers can access the goods they require, an alternative marketplace to bricks-and-mortar and online retail stores. Sellers are often ordinary consumers and the items on sale are often second-hand household items, although, modern C2C auction sites also accommodate small businesses selling unused products. Consumer behaviour in online C2C auctions is unlike consumer behaviour in bricks-and-mortar or online retail stores. While considerable research has been conducted into the dynamics of bidding in online C2C auctions little research has addressed the motives for consumers&#8217; ongoing participation in this marketplace. The concept of consumer involvement may explain the amount of time and money consumers are spending in online C2C auctions and the frequency of their visits to auction sites. In the context of this thesis, involvement is defined as the long-term and enduring relevance, connection and relatedness of online auctions to a consumer&#8217;s life. The aim of this research is to explore the ways in which the consumer involvement construct offers an explanation for variation in buyers&#8217; ongoing use of online auctions. The thesis also seeks to discover which consumer motives contribute to buyers&#8217; enduring involvement with online auctions. TradeMe is New Zealand&#8217;s most popular online C2C auction site. In a country of just four million people, the TradeMe auction site has more than 2 million members and accounts for more than 50 per cent of Internet traffic originating from New Zealand websites. This study of buyers who use the TradeMe auction site, offers the opportunity to study online auction consumers in this unique context. Based on an extensive literature review, eighteen propositions were developed regarding buyer motives for enduring involvement with online C2C auctions. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty TradeMe users, to test these propositions and to identify any further motives for enduring involvement with auctions that had not been revealed in the literature review. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in full. NVivo8 qualitative data analysis software was used to code the interview transcripts. Thematic analysis reveals six themes representing buyer motives for enduring involvement with online auctions. The significant contribution of this thesis is to identify involvement as a useful construct for explaining consumer behaviour in online auctions. In addition to utilitarian and hedonic motives for involvement with online auctions, the interviews reveal that the buyers have a number of social and personal motives for involvement with online auctions. Analysis of the qualitative dataset also reveals a set of marketer activities which encourage ongoing use of the auction site, and a number of factors (anti-motives) which discourage use of the auction site. The research reveals the existence of an off-line community of auction users who value the social contact they experience with one another outside the auction site. Ongoing buyer-seller relationships are also shown to develop outside the auction site, prompted by an initial auction transaction. TradeMe users often express loyalty to the TradeMe website because they are proud of its New Zealand origins, feel secure in using a local auction website, believe they are supporting small New Zealand businesses by buying from TradeMe, and believe they are practicing sustainable consumption behaviour by purchasing second-hand goods. Future research should develop a multi-item, quantitative measure of buyers&#8217; enduring involvement with online auctions and test the validity of this measure with further empirical data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online auctions</field><field name="subject">Consumer involvement</field><field name="subject">Consumer motives</field><field name="subject">Business relationships</field><field name="subject">TradeMe</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supramolecular transition metal architectures</field><field name="creator">Cordes, David B.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the investigation of the coordination and supramolecular chemistry of three different types of pyridine-containing ligand with a selection of Ag(I), Cu(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) salts. The ligand types are flexible and four-armed, rigid and four-armed and bent with two rigid arms. All the ligands also display the ability to form additional supramolecular interactions.
	Chapter one introduces supramolecular chemistry and crystal engineering and covers background on several areas of current interest in these fields. Network structures, both coordination polymers and hydrogen-bonded systems, are discussed and topological analysis as a method of describing and comparing network structures is introduced. An outline of the ligand design, choice of transition metals and anions is given.
	Chapter two provides a review of flexible four-armed pyridine-containing ligands and their use in coordination chemistry. The synthesis and characterisation of three flexible four-armed ligands 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (2tet), 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(3-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (3tet) and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridylmethyl-sulfanylmethyl)benzene (4tet) are given. The synthesis and characterisation of the Ag(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) complexes formed with these three ligands are also given. The complex of [Cd(2tet)(NO&#8323;)&#8324;] was structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction and was found to be a discrete species. The complexes {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](PF&#8326;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(3tet)](CF&#8323;CO&#8322;)&#8322;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)]-(ClO&#8324;)&#8322;&#65533;2MeCN&#65533;2CHCl&#8323;}n&#818;, {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)](PF&#8326;)&#8322;&#65533;6MeCN}n&#818; and {[Ag&#8322;(4tet)](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;-&#65533;3H&#8322;O}n&#818; were likewise structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. All these complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. A comparison of the seven structures is given at the end of the chapter.
	Chapter three reviews rigid four-armed pyridine-containing ligands and their use in coordination chemistry. The preparation of the rigid four-armed ligand 2,3,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)thiophene (pyth) is given. The synthesis and characterisation of the Ag(I), Cu(I) and Cd(II) complexes formed with this ligand are also given. The complexes [Ag(pyth)](BF&#8324;)&#65533;3MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Ag(pyth)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Ag(pyth)]-(CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#65533;2MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818;, [Cu(pyth)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN&#65533;CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;}n&#818; and [(Cu&#8322;I&#8322;)(pyth)]-(BF&#8324;)&#65533;1/2CH&#8322;Cl&#8322;&#65533;H&#8322;O}n&#818; were structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. The complex with CuI was a two-dimensional coordination polymer, and the other four complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. A comparison of the five structures is given at the end of the chapter.
	Chapter four begins with a review of rigid angular bridging ligands and their use in coordination and supramolecular chemistry. The preparation of the ligand bis(4-pyridyl)amine (bpa) is given. The structural arrangement of bpa in the solid state was determined by X-ray diffraction. Complexes of Ag(I), Cu(I), Cu(II) and Cd(II) formed with this ligand were synthesised and characterised. The complexes {[Ag(bpa)(MeCN)](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](PF&#8326;)&#65533;MeCN}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](ClO&#8324;)-&#65533;2MeCN}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](ClO&#8324;)}n&#818;, {[Ag(bpa)](NO&#8323;)}n&#818;, [(Cu&#8322;I&#8322;)(bpa)&#8322;]n&#818;, {[Cu(bpa)&#8322;Cl&#8322;]-&#65533;3DMF&#65533;3/2H&#8322;O}n&#818;, {[Cd(bpa)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)(H&#8322;O)](NO&#8323;)}n&#818;, {[Cd(bpa)&#8322;(SO&#8324;)(H&#8322;O)]&#65533;3H&#8322;O}n&#818;, [Cd(bpaH)&#8322;(SO&#8324;)&#8322;(H&#8322;O)&#8322;]&#65533;2MeCN and {[Cd(bpa)(SCN)&#8322;]&#65533;1/5iPrOH}n&#818; were structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction. All complexes with Ag(I) were one-dimensional coordination polymers, with two of them helical, the other three zigzag. Both complexes with Cu(I) and (II) were two-dimensional coordination polymers. One complex with CdSO&#8324; was discrete, with the bpa ligands mono-protonated, but all other three other Cd(II) complexes were three-dimensional coordination polymers. Seven of these complexes showed hydrogen-bonding interactions linking them together to form supramolecular structures of higher dimensionalities. A comparison of the twelve structures is given at the end of the chapter.

In South Westland, south of the Arawata River, however, several terranes converge onto the Alpine fault. Inherent anisotropies arising from the position of pre-existing fault structures, lithological contacts and rheological heterogeneities within these give rise to an atypically diffuse and complex zone, the overall geometry of which resembles a regional scale transpressive flower structure.
	The flower structure is a broad deformation zone 60 km in length extending approximately 7 km from the Alpine fault to its eastern limit, the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt. Integral parts of the structure are the Hollyford Fault System and the Livingstone Fault System. The area is characterised by an array of left-stepping, subparallel faults with an average 060&#65533; strike linked by 020&#65533; striking structures. All fault traces offset Quaternary features. Fractions of the total interplate slip are partitioned across the reactivated structures. Additionally, kinematic indicators reveal partitioning of strike-slip and oblique/dip-slip deformation across the related secondary fault zones.
	The behaviour of the plate boundary zone in South Westland is fundamentally controlled by reactivation of the Hollyford Fault System and the Livingstone Fault System which partition slip away from the Alpine fault. As a consequence, the eastward transferral of slip onto the curved geometry of the converging fault systems has ultimately created a left-stepping contractional regime, the equivalent of a restraining bend in the plate boundary zone. The competent Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt controls the geometry and evolution of the reactivated structures. It also acts as an indenter and imposes additional boundary conditions adding to the shortening component in the region and the onset of complex transpressional strain patterns.
	The geometry and kinematics of the flower structure in the upper crust is mimicked in the ductile mid to lower crust. Upper greenschist facies mylonites reveal a complex fold pattern developed in response to contemporaneous non-coaxial and coaxial deformation. The folding formed during a continuation of deformation associated with mylonitisation at depths within the fault system. The fact that strain localisation and transpressive strain patterns in the brittle crust continue into the ductile zones suggests there is a feedback relationship between the two regimes.
	The reactivation of pre-existing structures and the influence of rheological factors are considered as first order factors controlling strain partitioning in the plate boundary zone. Recognition of local strain partitioning is important for assessing slip rates and earthquake recurrence. Similarly, the faults extend down below the seismogenic zone so that interaction of the different structures with each other may produce changes in fault behaviour which affects earthquake nucleation.
	Although the Alpine fault is a major structure in the South Island of New Zealand with over 400 km of dextral movement, the reactivated structures still exert a degree of control locally on the structure and kinematics of the plate boundary zone. Reactivation of inherent fault structures has important implications for the initiation of plate boundary faults and the alteration of the plate boundary geometry with evolving deformation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plate tectonics</field><field name="subject">rock deformation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Westland</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060705.150820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of an 84 kb linear plasmid that encodes DDE cometabolism in Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1</field><field name="creator">Shirley, Matt</field><field name="description">DDT, an extremely widely used organochlorine pesticide, was banned in most developed countries more than 30 years ago. However, DDT residues, including 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), still persist in the environment and have been identified as priority pollutants due to their toxicity and their ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain. In particular, DDE was long believed to be &amp;quotenon-biodegradable&amp;quote, however some microorganisms have now been isolated that are able to metabolise DDE in pure culture. Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1 was enriched from a DDT-contaminated agricultural soil from the Canterbury plains and is able to metabolise DDE to 4-chlorobenzoic acid when induced with biphenyl. The primary objective of this study was to identify the gene(s) responsible for Terrabacter sp. strain DDE-1&#65533;s ability to metabolise DDE and, in particular, to investigate the hypothesis that DDE-1 degrades DDE cometabolically via a biphenyl degradation pathway. Catabolism of biphenyl by strain DDE-1 was demonstrated, and a biphenyl degradation (bph) gene cluster containing bphDA1A2A3A4BCST genes was identified. The bphDA1A2A3A4BC genes are predicted to encode a biphenyl degradation upper pathway for the degradation of biphenyl to benzoate and cis-2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and the bphST genes are predicted to encode a two-component signal transduction system involved in regulation of biphenyl catabolism. The bph gene cluster was found to be located on a linear plasmid, designated pBPH1. A plasmid-cured strain (MJ-2) was unable to catabolise both biphenyl and DDE, supporting the hypothesis that strain DDE-1 degrades DDE cometabolically via the biphenyl degradation pathway. Furthermore, preliminary evidence from DDE overlayer agar plate assays suggested that Pseudomonas aeruginosa carrying the strain DDE-1 bphA1A2A3A4BC genes is able to catabolise DDE when grown in the presence of biphenyl. 
 A second objective of this study was to characterise pBPH1. The complete 84,054-bp sequence of the plasmid was determined. Annotation of the DNA sequence data revealed seventy-six ORFs predicted to encode proteins, four pseudogenes, and ten gene fragments. Putative functions were assigned to forty-two of the ORF and pseudogenes. Besides biphenyl catabolism, the major functional classes of the predicted proteins were transposition, regulation, heavy metal transport/resistance, and plasmid maintenance and replication. It was shown that pBPH1 has the terminal structural features of an actinomycete invertron, including terminal proteins and terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). This is the first report detailing the nucleotide sequence and characterisation of a (linear) plasmid from the genus Terrabacter.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DDT (insecticide)</field><field name="subject">persistent pollutants</field><field name="subject">plasmids</field><field name="subject">organochlorine compounds</field><field name="subject">chlorohydrocarbons</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060804.094902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vladimir Nabokov, 1938 : the artistic response to tyranny</field><field name="creator">Caulton, Andrew</field><field name="description">Nabokov is well known for writing numerous indictments of totalitarian tyranny, most notably Invitation to a Beheading (1935) and Bend Sinister (1947). However, my contention in this thesis is that Nabokov&#65533;s most sustained and most significant assault on totalitarian tyranny occurred in 1938. 
 The extent of Nabokov&#65533;s response to tyranny in 1938 is not immediately obvious. Some of Nabokov&#65533;s work of the year engages in an explicit assault on tyranny; however, in other cases the assault is oblique and in one instance cryptically concealed. In my thesis I examine each of the works of 1938, and set these against the political circumstances of the year, the tense atmosphere on the threshold of World War II. I find that all of the works of 1938, in one manner or another, respond to the political climate of the day; that Nabokov in 1938 made an unparalleled artistic response to tyranny in a uniquely ominous year. 
 The thesis is divided into two parts. Part 1 contains studies of each of the lesser works of 1938: chapter 5 of The Gift, "Tyrants Destroyed," The Waltz Invention, "The Visit to the Museum," and "Lik." These studies are inset into a chronological survey of the personal and political circumstances of Nabokov&#65533;s life in 1938. 
 Part 2 constitutes the most significant aspect of my thesis, an in-depth study of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, Nabokov&#65533;s main work of 1938. The novel has been regarded as detached from the pre-war climate of the day; however, in an extensive new reading I find that the bright appearance of the novel is only a facade. My reading reveals a triadic, chess-problem-like structure to the novel, where the innocuous surface (the thesis) gives way to a cryptically concealed level of totalitarian themes (the antithesis), before the novel finally emerges onto a notional third level (the synthesis), the novel&#65533;s "solution." The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, I contend, represents the heart of Nabokov&#65533;s artistic response to tyranny in 1938. Through the triadic unfolding of the novel and the reader&#65533;s creative engagement with the text, Nabokov demonstrates that art itself triumphs over tyranny.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vladimir Nabokov (1899-1977)</field><field name="subject">despotism in literature</field><field name="subject">politics in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060808.090922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergroup discrimination and the need to belong</field><field name="creator">Pehi, Phillipa TePaea</field><field name="description">Intergroup discrimination is a pervasive fact of life and many factors are proposed to contribute or relate to its existence and expression (e.g. Staub, 2001). Though much research in social psychology has focused on the need for positive self-esteem as an underlying motive, in the past 25 years, evidence for the role of self-esteem in intergroup discrimination has at best proved contradictory (see Long &amp; Spears, 1997; Rubin &amp; Hewstone, 1998). More recently, other motivational constructs for human behaviour have been proposed to play a part in intergroup discrimination (e.g. Abrams &amp; Hogg, 2001). This thesis focuses on the need to belong (or belongingness) as this has long been recognised as a basic human need (e.g. Horney, 1945) and recently, evidence has been provided to support this assumption (e.g. Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). Thus the present thesis argues that as a fundamental need, the need to belong (NTB) would be expected to play a role in intergroup discrimination. In support of this assumption, results from some empirical studies are also highly suggestive of a link between intergroup discrimination and the NTB (e.g. Marques &amp; Paez, 1994), though the current research programme is the first to explicitly examine this link. Seven experiments employing the same basic methodology were conducted to investigate the central hypothesis that engaging in intergroup discrimination decreases the NTB. Three experiments supported the hypothesis. Experiments 2 and 3 found that the NTB decreased for New Zealanders who engaged in intergroup discrimination and Experiment 7 found that members of a minimally socially important group showed a decrease in the NTB following intergroup discrimination when measured at a group level, but not at the personal level. 
 Experiment 1 (Chapter 5) investigated the central hypothesis utilizing the minimal group paradigm (MGP). Despite participants exhibiting intergroup discrimination when given the opportunity, there was no significant change in their reported NTB. Thus the results of this experiment did not support the central hypothesis. Experiment 2 (Chapter 6) investigated whether the central hypothesis would be supported if participants were members of a realistic and meaningful social group category (i.e. New Zealanders). Results from this experiment showed that those participants who exhibited intergroup discrimination did in fact show a significant decrease in their NTB. Experiment 3 (Chapter 7) sought to replicate these results and to control for self-esteem effects utilizing New Zealand participants. Again, results supported the central hypothesis and no effect was found for either global or collective self-esteem. To test whether this result would generalize to other social categories, Experiment 4 (Chapter 8) tested whether the NTB would be decreased after women participants engaged in intergroup discrimination. Results found there was no significant difference in the NTB between women who engaged in discrimination and those who did not. Thus the central hypothesis and the results from Experiment 2 and 3 were not supported. To then investigate whether social influence accounted for the contradictory results from Experiments 1-4, Experiment 5 (Chapter 9) required women to publicly or privately state their intergroup discrimination. No significant changes were found in the NTB (from pre- to post- allocation task) for either private or public responding conditions, whether women engaged in intergroup discrimination or not. It was then assessed whether the importance to participants of the social identity in question was a factor. Experiments 6a and 6b (Chapter 10; women and men respectively) compared the NTB of participants with low identification with their social group, to high identifying participants. For both women and men, no significant changes were found in the NTB from pre- to post-allocation task for either high or low identifiers, regardless of whether they engaged in intergroup discrimination. Thus the central hypothesis was again not supported. Finally in Experiment 7, the NTB measure was re-evaluated and items were changed to be more group-oriented, compared to the original more individually-oriented items. The procedure used for Experiment 1 (i.e. MGP) was employed for Experiment 7 (Chapter 11) with participants completing both the personal and group versions of the NTB scale. The results for the modified group NTB scale showed that for participants who engaged in intergroup discrimination, group NTB decreased significantly from pre- to post- allocation task, compared with no significant change for those participants who did not engage in discrimination. No effects were found for either control or experimental participants&#65533; responses on the original NTB scale. Thus the central hypothesis and the results from Experiments 2 and 3 were supported. Furthermore, as was found for earlier experiments, there was no effect of either personal or collective self-esteem on the results for Experiments 4- 7. Taken overall, these results indicate that there may be a relationship between intergroup discrimination and the need to belong and that this may be most appropriately assessed using a group level measure of the NTB. Moreover, these results cannot be explained on the basis of self-esteem. Results from Experiments 2 and 3 may also indicate that if the social group category is meaningful enough for the individual (e.g. nationality), significant changes for the NTB at the personal level may occur. Despite the limitations of the present research, these results indicate that the investigation of the relationship between intergroup discrimination and the need to belong may further elucidate the underlying nature of prejudice. A number of possible directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">descrimination</field><field name="subject">prejudices</field><field name="subject">group identity</field><field name="subject">identity (psycological)</field><field name="subject">self-esteem</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060809.134640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Scenery and Chardonnay': a visitor perspective of the New Zealand winery experience</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Richard D.</field><field name="description">It is widely recognised that the tourism experience involves pre-visit anticipation, travel to and from the site and post-visit reminiscence or recollection, yet to date few studies have explored the link between these elements. Winery visitation presents an excellent opportunity to explore these phases of the travel experience as wine is present pre-visit, on-site and post-visit. In 1999 this study set out to explore these links by surveying visitors to 33 New Zealand wineries and then tracking their behaviour six to eight months post-visit via a postal survey. 
 From an initial sample of 1,090, 636 follow-up surveys were distributed with 358 usable surveys returned. The on-site survey explored the pre-visit and on-site wine habits and winery visitation behaviour of respondents, while 97 semi-structured interviews were also undertaken in order to provide further detail on some aspects of the on-site visit. The follow-up survey included an exploration of the respondents&#65533; on-going purchasing and consumption of wine as well as experiential elements such as recollection of the visit, word-of-mouth behaviour and enduring levels of satisfaction. A number of a priori segmentation criteria drawn from wine consumer behaviour and wine tourism literature have been applied in the analysis of the data in order to provide a detailed discussion of the various elements of this multi-phased experience. 
 Many regional differences were observed in the demographic profile of respondents, while the age profile of male and female visitors were also significantly different. This has dispelled the myth of a 'typical winery visitor' put forward by many early wine tourism researchers and highlights the need for detailed market analysis for wineries and wine regions. Pre-visit wine habits and winery visitation behaviour were influenced by gender, age/generation and country of origin. However, the most significant influence was between different levels of wine knowledge. This highlights the importance of wine education and interpretation, which was also identified as an important part of the winery visit by many respondents. Examination of the on-site experience identified important regional differences in the nature of the winery experience and lead to the coining of the term touristic terroir to describe the nuances of the regional experience. Almost half of the respondents made a post-visit purchase, while there were moderately high levels of enduring satisfaction and high levels of word-of-mouth behaviour. Post-visit purchases were primarily influenced by taste, but experiential elements of the visit (including sharing the wine or winery experience with others, memory of the visit and the service received) were also moderately influential. 
 This study has provided an insight into wine tourism and the behaviour of the winery visitor. It is the first and, to date, only nationwide survey of winery visitors anywhere in the world and one of only a handful of tourism studies that have attempted to track the behaviour of respondents. It has identified important connections between the on-site experience, experiential aspects of the post-visit experience and the purchasing and consumption behaviour of winery visitors. It also provides a framework for the study of other areas of tourism including souvenir purchases, holiday photography, food and tourism and tourist behaviour more broadly.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand wine industry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand wine districts</field><field name="subject">wineries</field><field name="subject">wine and wine making</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.150303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The deep cervical fascia : an anatomical study</field><field name="creator">Nash, Lance Graham</field><field name="description">Current understanding concerning the human deep cervical fascia (DCF) differs between anatomists, surgeons, and radiologists. One reason has been the varying methodologies used to examine the DCF and the terminology assigned to each layer or potential space formed. Previous knowledge concerning the DCF originally came from cadaveric studies. However, such findings were highly subjective, reliant on the dissectionist&#65533;s skill with a scalpel. With the recent advent of radiological imaging and sheet plastination, there has been a re-examination of the fascial layers (investing, pretracheal, and prevertebral) that constitute the DCF. Although there is general consensus regarding the existence of the three layers, there is continuing conjecture over the concise anatomical description of these fascial structures. Recently, the investing (superficial) fascia, as a separate fibrous structure, has been questioned with a small number of plastination studies reporting its absence in the postereolateral regions of the neck. Within the suboccipital region (SOS) it is widely reported that the nuchal ligament, extending from the investing layer, directly connects with the spinal dura mater. However, a recent plastination study by Johnson et al. (2000b) found these fibres to dissipate in the SOS.The question remains as to what fibres directly communicate with the spinal dura? The fibrous connective bridge is reported in some clinical studies to originate from the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) via the SOS. The origin of the connective fibrous bridge is essential in understanding the mechanism in the prevention of the phenomenon of 'infolding' and cervicogenic neck pain? Anteriorly, the investing fascia is regarded as a continuance of a 'fibrous collar' that encapsulates the entire neck, yet if it does not truly exist in the posterior neck region, does it actually exist as a tangible structure in the anterior neck? With regard to the deep midline fascial structures that arise from the pretracheal fascia, the presence of two separate spaces, the retropharyngeal and danger space, divided by the alar fascia in the posterior pharyngeal region, is still debated and is yet resolved in the clinical literature. 
 The aims of this qualitative study were to: 1. determine the dural ligamentous and tendinous connections in the posterior atlanto-occipital (PAO) interspace region, and establish the morphology of the PAO membrane, 2. determine whether the investing layer of the DCF is a distinct fibrous structure in the anterior neck and examine the relationship with the subcutaneous platysma muscle, and 3. determine the relationship between the RPS and DS in the posterior pharynx region and identify the configuration of the alar fascia. Twenty-seven cadavers were examined at the gross, macro- and, microscopic level. Blunt and sharp dissections were conducted on 12 specimens. Fifteen cadavers were prepared as epoxy sheet plastinates. Light, fluorescent and confocal microscopy was conducted on the sheet plastinations.The findings of the first study demonstrated that small discrete bundles from medial tendinous fibres of RCPm formed a fibrous connective tissue bridge directly with the spinal dura in the SOS (in all 6 median-sectioned plastinated specimens), not the nuchal ligament as commonly reported. The RCPm fascia, in conjunction with lateral contributions from the perivascular sheath, formed the PAO membrane (ligamentum flavum) which was not continuous with the neural arch of C1 as often cited in anatomical texts. The cerebrospinal junction was also demonstrated to be a naturally formed multi-layered structure in all plastinates and not the result of pathological change as widely reported in clinical literature.The Gross dissection findings of the second study supported the traditional view that the investing layer formed a covering over the anterior triangle neck region. However, findings from plastinations, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, demonstrated clearly that the investing layer is formed from the epimysium of superficial muscles in the anterior neck. In the suprahyoid neck, it appeared disjointed with the fascia of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) fascia isolated from the neighbouring submandibular fascia. In the infrahyoid neck, it was formed by medial fascial extensions from the omohyoid fascia, SCM fascia, and fused at the midline to the infrahyoid fascia, (pretracheal layer) resulting in two ipsilateral compartments. Distal 'finger-like' fascicles of platysma presented with individual epimysial fascia, which gave the false appearance of a thickened investing layer. These findings contravene those of the traditional view that the investing fascia is continuous at the mid-line.The findings of the third study agreed with both those reported in radiological and cadaveric studies respectively, in that the alar fascia was not present above the level of C1 as purported by radiologists, but became more apparent below this level. The alar fascia was observed to be formed from medial extensions of the carotid sheath, with some minor contributions from the lateral slips of the prevertebral fascia posteriorly, and was visible within transverse plastinated slices to the level of C7. However, at the levels of C4 and C6, the alar fascia appeared to fuse with the buccopharyngeal fascia, (posterior pretracheal layer of the DCF), a finding not previously reported. This study demonstrated, through E12 sheeted plastinated sections, that the morphology and topography of the DCF is complex, and a more precise understanding of the anatomy of the DCF and associated potential spaces is paramount clinically in otolaryngology, concerning the cervical fascial pathways of potentially life-threatening commutative pathologies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cervical vertebrae</field><field name="subject">fasciae (anatomy)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.155517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitats and macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top of Rarotonga, Cook Islands : implications for fisheries and conservation management</field><field name="creator">Drumm, Darrin Jared</field><field name="description">Throughout the Pacific, many species of echinoderms and molluscs have cultural value and are harvested extensively in subsistence fisheries. Many of these species are sedentary and often associated with distinct reef-top habitats. Despite the significance of reef habitats and their fauna for fisheries and biodiversity etc, little information has been available on the distribution of habitats and their influence on the reef-top fauna in the Cook Islands. This thesis developed a novel approach to assess the status of the shallow-water reef-tops of Rarotonga, Cook Islands, to provide critical information to fisheries and conservation managers. The approach used remote sensing (aerial photography with ground truthing) to map the spatial arrangement and extent of the entire reef-top habitats accurately, and historical wind data and coastline shape to determine the windward and leeward sides of the island. The benthic habitat maps and degree of wind exposure were used to design and undertake a stratified sampling programme to assess the distribution and abundance of the epibenthic macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top. I quantified the distribution and abundance of the epibenthic macroinvertebrates and how they varied with habitat, assessed the effectiveness of a traditional ra&#65533;ui (marine protected area) for conserving stocks of Trochus niloticus and other invertebrates, and investigated the reproductive biology and impacts of traditional gonad harvesting on Holothuria leucospilota. 
 There were four major habitat types (rubble/rock, sand/coral matrix, algal rim and sand) identified, the most extensive being rubble/rock (45%) and sand/coral matrix (35%). The degree of exposure to winds was found to correlate with the reef development and habitat distribution. 
 The assemblage composition of each major habitat type differed significantly from every other habitat. The rubble/rock habitat had the greatest substratum heterogeneity and structural complexity, and the highest number of species and individuals. The overall abundance of the fauna was dominated by holothurians (68%) and echinoids (30%), while Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima accounted for the remaining 2% of the total invertebrate assemblage. Clear habitat partitioning was also found for adult and juvenile Trochus niloticus and Tridacna maxima. 
 In the traditional fishery for Holothuria leucospilota, the mature gonads of males are harvested by making an incision in the body-wall of the animal, removing the gonads and then returning the animal to the reef to allow regeneration. Monthly collections of H. leucospilota were used to describe the reproductive biology of this species. Gametogenesis and spawning were synchronous between the sexes and spawning occurred annually during summer, when water temperature and photoperiod were at their highest. Although the incision in the body-wall and gonad removal had no impact on the survival of H.leucospilota in experimental cages, their body weight, and general sheltering and feeding behaviors were affected. Gonads took at least 41 days to start regenerating, suggesting a considerable delay in the spawning of fished individuals. 
 In 1998, five Rarotongan communities re-introduced the traditional ra&#65533;ui system of resource management, prohibiting all fishing and gathering from their reefs. The performance of the Nikao ra&#65533;ui, which had been put in place to allow trochus stocks to increase, was investigated. Comparisons of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and species density were made between three fishing treatments, i.e. fished areas adjacent to the ra&#65533;ui, within the ra&#65533;ui after two years of protection, and in the ra&#65533;ui after it had been lifted for three weeks to allow a commercial trochus harvest. Analysis of variance on the count data for the twelve most abundant species, and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling indicated that there were no differences in the microhabitat or the invertebrate assemblage composition between the three fishing treatments. However, there were significant differences between the rubble/rock and sand/coral matrix habitat types. The results on the effectiveness of the Nikao ra&#65533;ui are equivocal, due to the small sample size, and the variability between samples which was highlighted by the wide confidence intervals. 
 This study highlights the importance of habitat to the macroinvertebrate fauna of the reef-top and the need for accurate habitat maps to increase the cost-effectiveness of future resource surveys, to provide information to management, and for the design of Marine Protected Areas. The mapping and survey methods must be reliable and repeatable in terms of the limitations of time, and the availability of expertise, funding and resources. The results provide important information for fisheries and conservation managers of Rarotonga and other Pacific Islands to better design rigorous sampling programmes for monitoring the status of reef-top resources, and for evaluating and planning Marine Protected Areas.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reef ecology</field><field name="subject">reef resources assessment and management</field><field name="subject">marine invertebrates</field><field name="subject">marine resources conservation</field><field name="subject">fishery management</field><field name="subject">marine parks and reserves</field><field name="subject">Cook Islands</field><field name="subject">Rarotonga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060901.134208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Running in pain : an autoethnography of power, coercion and injury in coach-athlete relationship</field><field name="creator">Haleem, Hussain</field><field name="description">This autoethnographic study investigates the emotional and social dimensions of a coaching relationship from the athlete&#65533;s perspective.

Consequently, through the analysis of my memories and ethnographic notes, I analyse my experiences as an Olympic marathon runner and, in particular, the challenges I faced with my coach.

In order to make sense of my experiences, I draw upon theories of identity (e.g. Bradley, 1996), Foucauldian concepts on 'power' (e.g. Foucault, 1980), and the literature addressing 'premature retirement' (e.g. Sparkes 1996; 2000).

Both represent a categorical precursor but differ in the nature of their relationships to schizophrenia. Specifically, schizotypy is dimensional, unchanging despite the presence or remission of schizophrenia. In contrast, schizotaxia is a transitional precursor; the presence of schizophrenia signals the end of schizotaxia. There are also differences in the way in which risk is determined. Schizotypy is reflected in a variety of information processing and experiential aberrations, is typically assessed using self-report measures, and is best identified using taxometric analyses. In contrast, schizotaxia is characterised by negative symptoms of schizophrenia and neurocognitive impairment, can be assessed using standardised clinical measures, and is diagnosed at the individual case level. 
 The aim of Phase 1 of this study was to investigate the manifest structure of Meehl&#65533;s schizotypy in a sample of psychiatric patients. The aims of Phase 2 were to determine if schizotypy group membership was associated with poorer functioning and to determine the nature of the relationship between Meehl&#65533;s (1962, 1989, 1990b) schizotypy and Tsuang et al.&#65533;s (1999b, 2000a, 2000b) schizotaxia. Participants in Phase 1 were 109 psychiatric patients and all completed a self-report measure of schizotypy, the Thinking and Perceptual Style Questionnaire (TPSQ; Linscott &amp; Knight, 2004). Multivariate taxometric analyses of TPSQ subscales yielded evidence of a manifest group structure within the sample. The prevalence of the latent group, presumed to reflect schizotypy, was estimated to be 32% (SD = 8%), as yielded by MAXCOV analyses. MAXCOV analyses also yielded a mean indicator validity of 1.02; variance of 7; base rate estimates of .08; and a goodness of fit index of .98. MAMBAC analyses yielded a mean base rate of 56% (SD = 18%). 
 Twenty-nine participants from Phase 1 took part in Phase 2. Fourteen were from the schizotypy group (had a p value of .85 or higher of schizotypy group membership) and 15 from the nonschizotypy group (had a p value of .03 or lower of schizotypy group membership). Participants completed tests of attention, verbal memory, and executive functioning. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia were also rated and diagnosis was determined using a diagnostic interview. The schizotypy group was significantly impaired relative to the nonschizotypy group on neuropsychological test scores spanning domains of attention, verbal memory, and executive functioning. A current DSM-IV diagnosis was made for 71% of the schizotypy group and 43% of the nonschizotypy group. Individuals were classified as having met criteria for schizotaxia if they had a negative symptom impairment and a neuropsychological impairment in two domains. A total of 7 people of 29 met criteria for schizotaxia, 6 of these people were from the schizotypy group. There was statistical evidence that Meehl&#65533;s (1962, 1989, 1990b) schizotypy and Tsuang et al.&#65533;s (1999b, 2000a, 2000b) schizotaxia are not independent. The proposed precursors for schizophrenia may reflect the same construct, not separate entities.

 Although my primary focus is on the detrimental effects traditional gender roles have on girls and women, recently published studies claiming that 'masculinity' is in a state of crisis are of particular value to my work. The reasons contemporary critics offer for this 'crisis in masculinity' vary widely. There are those who are convinced that women are to blame for abandoning their traditional roles as wives and mothers and moving too far into areas of society that are traditionally 'male'. This, they believe, results in a 'feminised' society that has an adverse effect on the development and well-being of boys and men. Those who support this argument generally believe that social, emotional and psychological distinctions between the genders are biologically inherent rather than socially constructed, and would prefer to see gender positions polarised rather than assimilated. At the other end of the scale are those who believe that the behaviours associated with traditional 'masculinity' are outmoded, fostering a form of emotional distrophy that is responsible for the increase in male suicide and autistic-like behaviours. Those who support this argument believe that males should develop a new set of behavioural traits more closely aligned to those traditionally thought of as 'feminine': traits like spontaneity, expressiveness, empathy and compassion. 
 I have found the latter arguments exciting on two counts: firstly because an increasing number of male critics are joining female critics in acknowledging that many of the traits and behaviours traditionally associated with 'masculinity' are life-denying for both sexes; secondly, and most importantly, because these critics are echoing the findings of the feminist psychoanalytic critic, Jessica Benjamin, whose work I have found so stimulating. But, where critics have pointed to the problem ('masculine' behaviour) and recommended that it be modified to something more closely resembling 'feminine' behaviour, Benjamin has not only identified the source of the problem, she has developed a revised theory of human development, 'Intersubjectivity', which offers a positive and transformative approach to human behaviour. I examine Benjamin&#65533;s theory closely in Chapter Two, and make use of it in succeeding chapters. 
 In May 2000, financed by the Bamforth Scholarship fund (with help from the Humanities Division of the University of Otago), I attended a conference at the University of St Andrews entitled 'Scotland: The Gendered Nation', which gave me a wider view of the concerns of contemporary Scottish writers and scholars. The paper I presented at the conference, "That great brute of a bunion!": the construction of masculinity in Jessie Kesson&#65533;s Glitter of Mica&#65533;, was published in the Spring 2001 issue of Scottish Studies Review. Following the conference I spent the rest of May in Scotland finding out more about Kesson and her writing under the generous tutelage of Kesson&#65533;s biographer, Dr Isobel (Tait) Murray, from the University of Aberdeen. Kesson wrote many plays for the BBC, and I was able to read Dr Murray&#65533;s copies of some of these unpublished works in the security of the Kings College Library, along with back copies of North-East Review to which Kesson contributed. In Edinburgh I visited the National Library of Scotland which holds back copies of The Scots Magazine containing pertinent articles by Kesson and her contemporaries. Then I travelled to those parts of North-East Scotland which feature most precisely in Kesson&#65533;s life and writing. My Scottish month was invaluable for its insight into the critical literary climate of Scotland, and for allowing me to reach Jessie Kesson imaginatively: through the boarded-up windows of the Orphanage at Skene; by the ruined Cathedral at Elgin; at the top of Our Lady&#65533;s Lane; and on the steps of her cottar house at Westertown Farm. [SEE FOOTNOTE] It was a privilege to trace Kesson&#65533;s footsteps and then to return to the other side of the world with a much keener sense of her 'place'. I would like to think this has carried over into my work, the structure of which is as follows: 
 Chapter One gives a brief history of Jessie Kesson&#65533;s life and writing. Chapter Two focuses on Jessica Benjamin the feminist psychoanalytic critic whose work provides the main theoretical framework for my thesis. Chapter Three considers the expression of female sexuality in the novella Where the Apple Ripens, and the way society conspires to have it diminish rather than enhance a sense of female self-hood. Where the Apple Ripens is not Kesson&#65533;s first published work but, because it introduces the central concerns of my thesis through the experiences of an adolescent girl, I have chosen to begin with it rather than with The White Bird Passes and to work towards increasingly complex gender relations in succeeding chapters. 
 In Chapter Four, The White Bird Passes, I look at the way Kesson depicts girls and women as instruments of male sexuality, controlled by a nervous patriarchy whose institutions (family, education, church) take away the promise of her female characters. 
 Chapter Five is centred on The Glitter of Mica, and considers the consequences of a masculinity constructed around the destruction of 'the Mother'. 
 Chapter Six considers the fate of the anonymous young woman in Another Time, Another Place, and examines the conventions of the social order that deny her self-definition. 
 Chapter Seven also examines the social conventions that shape and limit the lives of Kesson&#65533;s female characters - this time in a selection of Kesson&#65533;s short stories and poems. 
 In Chapter Eight I look at selected writers from the eighteenth to the twentieth-century whose work, in diverse and often contradictory ways, has contributed to an interrogation of gender in Scottish literature. This is not an historical and systematic survey of gender relations in Scotland; it is not even an historical and systematic survey of gender questions in Scottish literature. Rather, it is an impressionistic account of such matters in some selected Scottish literature - selected in part to cover some highly influential figures, and in part from Jessie Kesson&#65533;s more immediate context: feminine, rural, the North East. There is a place for such historical and systematic work, of course, and I hope that someone will do it. All I can hope for is that I may have provided some beginning but more importantly, that my work in this chapter will sharpen, further, an understanding of Jessie Kesson. 
 I begin with the life and work of the poet, Robert Burns. As well as featuring in Kesson&#65533;s Glitter of Mica, Burns and his legacy are matters of influence in the gendered ideal of 'Scottishness' for both laymen and writers at home and abroad. Following Burns, I contrast the unconscious gender ideology which permeates Neil Gunn&#65533;s writing with the progressive awareness of gender issues that characterises the work of Lewis Grassic Gibbon and aligns the latter with Kesson&#65533;s. I then examine the idealised landscapes and sentimentalised characters of the Kailyard era and the hostile response of the anti-Kailyard writers. This leads into an examination of Hugh MacDiarmid&#65533;s poem, A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle. MacDiarmid, like Burns, was monumental on the Scottish literary scene and his efforts to rekindle the spirit of the primitive Scot through literature have made him influential with a smaller but equally significant group. What is of particular relevance to my work is that the ideal of 'Scottishness' fostered by writers such as Burns and MacDiarmid is heavily dependent on prescribed gender positions which promote the exploitation of women while rendering them subservient to men and politically powerless. It is from within this environment of gender-based Scottishness that Jessie Kesson and other women writers, were writing and arguing. Therefore, lastly, in Chapter Eight, I concentrate on those women writers whose work has the most relevance to the time, place and ideological content of Kesson&#65533;s writing: Violet Jacob, Catherine Carswell, Lorna Moon, Willa Muir and Nan Shepherd. The writing of all of these women is concerned with psychic well-being centred on human relations and/or self-determination and, of the five, the writings of Willa Muir and Nan Shepherd are considered more fully because of the particular contribution they make to my examination of Jessie Kesson: Willa Muir commented, both directly and indirectly, on gender matters. Nan Shepherd, quite apart from being a friend of many years to Jessie Kesson, wrote novels in which gender issues are entirely central.

A statistical parser uses a probabilistic grammar derived from a training corpus of hand-parsed sentences. The grammar is represented as a set of constructions - in a simple case these might be context-free rules. The probability of each construction in the grammar is then estimated by counting its relative frequency in the corpus. 
 A crucial problem when building a probabilistic grammar is to select an appropriate level of granularity for describing the constructions being learned. The more constructions we include in our grammar, the more sophisticated a model of the language we produce. However, if too many different constructions are included, then our corpus is unlikely to contain reliable information about the relative frequency of many constructions. 
 In existing statistical parsers two main approaches have been taken to choosing an appropriate granularity. In a non-lexicalised parser constructions are specified as structures involving particular parts-of-speech, thereby abstracting over individual words. Thus, in the training corpus two syntactic structures involving the same parts-of-speech but different words would be treated as two instances of the same event. In a lexicalised grammar the assumption is that the individual words in a sentence carry information about its syntactic analysis over and above what is carried by its part-of-speech tags. Lexicalised grammars have the potential to provide extremely detailed syntactic analyses; however, Zipf&#65533;s law makes it hard for such grammars to be learned. 
 In this thesis, we propose a method for optimising the trade-off between informative and learnable constructions in statistical parsing. We implement a grammar which works at a level of granularity in between single words and parts-of-speech, by grouping words together using unsupervised clustering based on bigram statistics. We begin by implementing a statistical parser to serve as the basis for our experiments. The parser, based on that of Michael Collins (1999), contains a number of new features of general interest. We then implement a model of word clustering, which we believe is the first to deliver vector-based word representations for an arbitrarily large lexicon. Finally, we describe a series of experiments in which the statistical parser is trained using categories based on these word representations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parsing (computer grammar)</field><field name="subject">computational linguistics</field><field name="subject">natural language processing (computer science)</field><field name="subject">linguistics</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060913.134736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A good woman : silencing the self, rumination and depression in romantic relationships</field><field name="creator">Fernando, Ruwani Kumari</field><field name="description">"Rumination" and "Silencing the Self" have both been theorised to explain women&#65533;s greater vulnerability to depression. Rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, e.g., 1987, 1991) refers to a passive focus on mood and symptoms, while Silencing the Self (Jack, 1991) refers to the socially-based belief that, broadly speaking, one should actively suppress one&#65533;s negative emotions and thoughts within romantic relationships. This thesis proposes that frequent suppression of negative emotional material within romantic relationships (self-silencing) makes that material more likely to be a target for rumination, resulting in greater depressed mood and depressive symptoms. 
 It seems paradoxical that the more one tries to suppress one&#65533;s thoughts, the more one thinks about them. Wenzlaff and Luxton (2003) have demonstrated that frequent suppression may make material more accessible and a more likely target of rumination. Study 1 was a pilot investigation. It was found that self-silencing (the broad construct) and thought suppression (a narrower construct) were related, and that both were positively correlated with rumination. Furthermore, thought suppression contributed to the relationship between self-silencing and rumination for women. 
 It was hypothesised that the more women suppress their negative feelings in romantic relationships (what Jack, 1991, describes as "Silencing the Self"), the more they will ruminate about these feelings and experience symptoms of depression. In Studies 2 and 3, the correlations among rumination, self-silencing and depression in adults and high school students were investigated. There were positive correlations among all the measured variables for adults and teenage girls, supporting the hypotheses. Regression analyses showed that for female adults and teenagers, rumination and self-silencing made unique, additive contributions to the prediction of depressive symptoms. 
 In Studies 4 and 5, the causal relationship among self-silencing, rumination and depressed mood was investigated. Participants were asked either to write about a sad event that had happened in their relationships, or a typical (neutral) event. In Study 4, participants were also instructed to write either factually about these events, or to write in a ruminative way about them. Participants&#65533; chronic tendencies to self-silence were measured and they were classed as "high" or "low" self-silencers based on a median split. Female participants who chronically self-silenced more frequently and who ruminated experienced the most dramatic decrease in mood. In Study 5 participants wrote factually or suppressed their feelings about sad or neutral events and their tendency to ruminate was measured. Participants were divided into "high" and "low" ruminators based on a median split of their rumination scores. There was no support for the alternative hypothesis that chronic ruminators who suppressed would report depressed mood. 
 Study 6 confirmed that in women, the combination of both chronic self-silencing in romantic relationships and acute rumination resulted in more severe symptoms of depression. Participants were e-mailed daily for one month about their self-silencing, rumination and negative mood. Chronic self-silencing, rumination and depressive symptoms were measured at the start and end of the month. Again, the combination of chronic self-silencing and acute rumination emerged as a better predictor of depressive symptoms than either variable alone. 
 The six studies reported in this thesis support the hypothesis that self-silencing and rumination together explain short term negative mood as well as depressive symptoms even after one month. These studies explain why certain women are more likely to experience depressed mood in the context of romantic relationships. In particular, the combination of being a high self-silencer and ruminating makes one especially vulnerable to depressed mood and depressive symptoms. 
 Clinically, there are already interventions targeted at rumination that are effective in reducing distress. However, the current research demonstrates that self-silencing may also be a promising target for intervention. Self-silencing is based on a wider understanding of the social context of depression. By targeting self-silencing, as well as rumination, depression may be more effectively treated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self psychology</field><field name="subject">self-denial</field><field name="subject">silence</field><field name="subject">depression</field><field name="subject">interpersonal communication</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060829.122313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of contextual factors on revision strategies : the case of four Malaysian native speakers of English in a mainstream E.S.L. classroom</field><field name="creator">Mallan, Vijay Kumar</field><field name="description">This case study explored the revision strategies of four Malaysian native speakers of English when they composed aloud while writing an argumentative essay. Think aloud verbal protocols were analysed using the grounded theory approach in conjunction with written texts. 
 The findings suggest that contextual factors influenced classroom practices. The contextual factors included a teacher who was not provided with adequate training, administrative policies which did not provide support for the development of writers based on their abilities, writing instruction which viewed revision as a process of error correction and public assessment practices which were non-transparent. These classroom practices influenced the participants&#65533; beliefs about revision. These beliefs affected the quality of their essays as judged by Malaysian public examiners. Additionally, the findings suggest a mismatch between classroom instruction and public examination. 
 Suggestions are made to address these concerns by considering the theoretical underpinnings of the cognitive process, socio-cultural and community of practice models of writing and learning. These include instruction on revision strategies, considering alternative assessment practices, providing formative feedback, ability streaming, focussing on critical reading skills and providing adequate support to the teacher.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Malay speakers</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">ability testing</field><field name="subject">errors of usage</field><field name="subject">composition and exercises</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">composition (language arts)</field><field name="subject">context (linguistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.115955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discursive analysis of a television advertising campaign : obliged to be healthy</field><field name="creator">Jardine, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes and demonstrates the use of discourse analysis as a means of facilitating critical awareness and stimulating research practice within a consumer research context. In a generic sense, discourse analysis applies to a range of semiotic methods for studying text (including talk, writing and visual images), where the objective is to gain insight into both the meanings of a text and what it signifies. Emphasis is placed on the constructive use of language, where texts of various kinds are said to construct our social world. Two approaches to discourse analysis are detailed. 
 Firstly, Foucauldian discourse analysis is shown to operate more generally and globally as a social and cultural resource that underpins many human endeavours and activities. Under this approach, discourses are seen as resources that interact with one another. Foucauldian discourse analysis is therefore quite a different enterprise from the finer-grained investigation of talk and texts that is undertaken in discourse analysis and discursive psychology. Instead, discourses are treated as being dynamic in nature, having the ability to mutate over time, and gain dominance in certain settings and cultural locations. Discourse analysis under this approach facilitates critical awareness because it seeks to uncover the ways in which such discourses produce, maintain and constrain people within particular positions and relationships. 
 Secondly, a discursive psychological approach to discourse analysis focuses on the strategic use of discourse within a particular piece of text, where interaction and the acknowledgement of such interaction by the researcher underscores the importance of language and the ways that people purposefully and strategically use language to achieve particular outcomes or goals. A discursive psychological approach focuses upon discursive practices and constructions, rather than cognitive-perceptual processes. A discourse analytic approach is therefore able to potentially redefine and stimulate current research practice. Psychological phenomena that might have traditionally been framed and studied as 'cognitive' and 'internal' processes can be recast as particular situated discursive accomplishments that people are able to draw upon. Because analysis is not subject to what may be termed 'cognitive reductionism' (where attempts to explain social events and processes are made entirely by reference to events and structures in the mental processes of individuals), a discursive analytic approach suggests new insights into current research practice. 
 The specific context for analysis within this thesis is provided by an advertising campaign for Xenical, a pharmaceutical product promoted as a treatment for obesity. Xenical was one of the first prescription medications to be marketed directly to consumers in New Zealand via the use of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), a relatively recent form of marketing communication. The Xenical advertising campaign created both controversy and high awareness for the product. Contributing to this controversy was the overt use of DTCA itself, which critics suggest influences patient demand, encourages the use of expensive and sometimes unnecessary medications and in effect, 'creates' disease. As argued here, positioning obesity as a disease in effect justifies (warrants) the pharmaceutical industry&#65533;s efforts to offer medical solutions. 
 In addition to the use of DTCA, the nature of the Xenical advertisements was also controversial. Critics suggested that the Xenical advertisements were based upon negative emotions, associating the state of being overweight with feelings of sadness, shame and embarrassment. These 'emotions' become a key subject in the current study. But in this thesis, rather than viewing such emotions as internal and mental phenomena, the use of discourse analysis focuses on the socio-cultural nature of emotions. Discourse analysis is concerned with uncovering the ways in which bodily sensations are rendered into language and what the subsequent implications for the speaker might be as a result. 
 Using the advertising campaign for Xenical as context then, discourse analysis is used as a research approach to examine the television advertisements from multiple perspectives. Analysis includes the study of the casting tapes that were used by the advertising agency as source material to inform the creative strategy for the advertisements. In addition, one of the Xenical advertisements is deconstructed in greater detail, outlining the effects of visual and aural discourses that weave together to convey meaning within the advertisement. Analysis is informed by interviews conducted with the creative director of the advertisements as well as the marketing manger for Xenical. Discourse analysis allows us to examine the ways in which the producers of an advertisement purposefully (although perhaps unknowingly) create particular effects for strategic reasons, and how advertisements may be subsequently read as a consequence. The final analysis is based on a reader-response to the advertising campaign. Analysis focuses on the &#65533;emotional&#65533; talk contained within a particular interview, and how talk functions as performance. Rather than treating emotional talk as a description or reflection of inner psychological worlds, discourse analysis examines participant talk in terms of its content and meanings and how participants use such talk to construct their worlds. Although often overlooked within traditional forms of consumer research, the importance of representing social interaction through detailed interview transcripts is demonstrated, underscoring the analysis provided. Results suggest that the language of description and the methods of data capture that are typically utilised within consumer research are not able to provide an accurate account of the external world. This is because the only way we can know our world is always going to be mediated by and through language, and as a consequence, the meanings and interpretations available to us are never going to be transparent or neutral representations. 
 The findings suggested in this thesis are intended as a starting point for subsequent research into the study of language in use and human meaning making within advertising and consumer research environments. Because consumer research has borrowed heavily from the social sciences and particularly from psychology, then it is important that researchers within the discipline re-examine many of the psychological topics that we commonly take for granted by considering the way such talk and text is used in action. Discourse analysis provides a research approach that enables such a re-examination.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television advertising</field><field name="subject">advertising campaigns</field><field name="subject">health products</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061101.114209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refining an entrepreneurial orientation and its impact on driving markets behaviours</field><field name="creator">Zortea, Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Firms adopting an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) can be described as firms that take risks, are proactive in pursuing opportunities, compete aggressively with their industry rivals, launch products that change market boundaries and market behaviour, and grant employees autonomy to facilitate the generation of such radical innovation. Although an EO has been widely investigated in entrepreneurship research, only a few attempts have been undertaken to refine and broaden the EO construct since its development in the early 1980s. The two characteristics competitive aggressiveness and autonomy have only recently been added to an EO. This thesis argues that more components should be incorporated to achieve a more comprehensive EO construct: opportunity recognition, growth commitment and organisational learning. 
 The current thesis suggests that an EO, as it is currently acknowledged in the literature, is in need of further refinement. More specifically, a detailed examination of the construct reveals several inconsistencies such as equivocal EO definitions (actual entrepreneurial behaviours and practices vs. propensities to act entrepreneurially), ambiguous EO components and poorly operationalised scales. Furthermore, the psychometric properties of an EO have not been clearly specified (unidimensional vs. multidimensional, formative vs. reflexive). Due to these discrepancies, this thesis calls for a clearer and more comprehensive discussion of an EO along with a more valid EO scale. 
 One of the consequences of an EO as presented in this thesis is that of driving markets. A firm&#65533;s ability to drive markets is considered a vital means with which to achieve firm success and long-term survival. Firms that drive markets engage in radical innovation, shape the needs of current and future customers, and change the market structure they are operating in. Unfortunately, however, firms often focus too closely on current customers and their needs, competitors and market conditions - that is, are market-driven. Instead of altering the composition of a market and/or the behaviours of market players, market-driven firms work within the confines of their markets, promoting incremental innovation rather than radical innovation. 
 Despite the importance of driving markets behaviours for firm success, there is little theoretical and empirical evidence to support how driving markets behaviours can be achieved. In order to address this gap, this thesis calls upon an EO as one possible antecedent of driving markets behaviours. Thus, following the development of an improved EO construct, this thesis then moves to establish a theoretical framework that describes an EO and its impact on driving markets/market-driven behaviours. To help establish an EO&#65533;s predictive validity, the framework is further enriched by adding a market orientation (MO), thereby comparing and contrasting both an EO and a MO in relation to driving markets and market-driven behaviours 
 The data used for this research is based upon a study of 836 New Zealand firms. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to test for unidimensionality and to set up stable measurement models for all constructs in question. Structural equation modeling is then applied to examine an EO&#65533;s psychometric properties and the relationship between an EO, a MO and driving markets/market-driven behaviours. The findings indicate that an EO is a multidimensional and formative construct, yet with only four contributing dimensions (R&amp;D, proactiveness, autonomy, and growth commitment). It is further shown that an EO has a very strong direct impact on driving markets behaviours and also influences such behaviours considerably more than a MO. The same can be said about an EO&#65533;s effect on market-driven behaviours. 
 A MO&#65533;s direct impact on driving markets/market-driven behaviours is somewhat diminished by the suppressive negative effects of the responsiveness dimension of the MO construct, particularly on driving markets behaviours. Subsequent analysis shows that unlike an EO, a MO does not lead to driving markets behaviours, but rather to market-driven behaviours. In contrast, an EO is found to represent a more balanced approach, since it triggers both driving markets and market-driven behaviours.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061108.145532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Graham Scott</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of how primitive states form. The first part of the thesis defines a state. I then analyse Hobbes&#65533;s Theory of the Commonwealth by Acquisition (TCA), expounded in Leviathan. I conclude that this theory fails as an answer to the question of how primitive states form as it suffers from at least five major flaws. I go on to explain, modify and correct Hobbes&#65533;s TCA through techniques that have been used in modern critiques of Hobbes&#65533;s Theory of the Commonwealth by Institution. The result is the strongest possible answer that Hobbes can give to the question of how primitive states form. I conclude that his attempt fails as even if the technical aspects of his theory can be fixed, the overall problem of empirical falsification occurs. 
 I then put forward my own theory, based on the modified Hobbesian theory. The major innovation is the replacement of individuals with groups in the Hobbesian State of Nature. This move answers the problem of empirical falsification, at least initially. The theory also helps to explain several of the more technical problems with Hobbes&#65533;s theory. The resulting theory is a Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation. 
 The next step in the thesis is to match the Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation to the empirical evidence of primitive state formation, represented by anthropology. I analyse the anthropological literature and put forward that at least one recent research program in anthropology matches my Hobbesian theory of primitive state formation. 
 I conclude that Hobbesian theory, based on the TCA can be successfully modernised into a plausible answer to the question of how primitive states formed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primitive states</field><field name="subject">political anthropology</field><field name="subject">natural law</field><field name="subject">nature and civilization</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)</field><field name="subject">Leviathan</field><field name="subject">political science</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070117.155354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academics&#65533; experiences of Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF) : governmentality and subjection</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Craig</field><field name="description">In 2002 New Zealand&#65533;s government set out to "accelerate" the nation&#65533;s "transformation into a knowledge society" (Ministry of Education, 2002a, p. 16). Underpinning the development of this so-called 'knowledge society' was a new approach in the way tertiary education was funded. This included introducing a new contestable model of research funding called Performance-Based Research Funding (PBRF). The research reported here was conducted at a critical juncture in the ongoing development and implementation of PBRF because it captures the experiences of fifteen academics as they encounter PBRF and the Quality Evaluation exercise for the first time. Their experiences of the inaugural 2003 Quality Evaluation exercise were examined using a discourse analysis approach informed by Michel Foucault&#65533;s (1926-1984) ideas of 'subjection' and 'governmentality'. 'Subjection' occurs when individuals shape their identities by responding to the multiple discourses that are available to them at any particular time and within any historical context (Foucault, 1969). 'Governmentality' refers to a particular instrument, technique or activity that guides and shapes conduct by producing a compliant human subject capable of supporting the interests and objectives of the state (Foucault, 1994a). In the case of academics this might mean conforming to PBRF policies and practices and participating in the development and transformation of a new 'knowledge society'. 
 In this thesis I examine the potential for PBRF to reshape and redirect the nature of research and suggest that some assessment elements of the 2003 Quality Evaluation were flawed and, as a result, a number of participants in this study were now making decisions about their research that appeared contrary to their best interests. I also investigate PBRF as a field of compliance and argue that the Quality Evaluation exercise represents a technology of government that targets the activities and practices of New Zealand&#65533;s research academics with the effect of manifesting a more docile and compliant academic subject. I then question PBRF&#65533;s impact on the career aspirations and opportunities of academics and claim that the PBRF Quality Evaluation framework has already shifted from being a mechanism for distributing funds for research to one that identifies and rewards the most 'talented' researchers via institutional appointments and promotions. Finally, I interrogate the pursuit and practice of academic freedom and argue that as a consequence of PBRF, a number of participants in this study have positioned themselves in ways that could diminish and constrain their traditional rights to academic freedom. 
 PBRF has the potential to locate academics within a new status-driven hierarchy of professional validation whereby the Quality Evaluation exercise will purportedly measure, evaluate and reward the most 'talented' researchers and the 'best' research. In this thesis I argue that the PBRF Quality Evaluation framework operates as a form of disciplinary power exercised as part of an international trend of intensifying audit and assessment practices in higher education. In this sense, I claim that PBRF exists as an instrument of governmentality capable of constituting a new type of academic subject by significantly shifting the way academics will have to think and conduct their professional selves in relation to their work and research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Ministry of Education</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education strategy 2002/07</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault (1926-1984)</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">college teachers</field><field name="subject">Government aid to higher education</field><field name="subject">higher education and state</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070125.162438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shared factors in autobiographical memory and theory of mind development</field><field name="creator">Pinder, Kirsty</field><field name="description">When humans use the mental states (e.g., beliefs, intentions) and the emotional states of others to predict or explain another person&#65533;s behaviour, they have demonstrated their theory of mind understanding. Theory of mind is "one of the quintessential abilities that makes us human" (Baron-Cohen, 2000, p. 3). Emotion understanding has been considered by some to be an aspect of theory of mind understanding. There are several theories proposed to explain the development of theory of mind, from changes in representational abilities (Perner, 1991), to having an innate domain specific module (Fodor, 1992; Leslie, 1994), to social linguistic influences (Nelson et al., 2003). One facet of theory of mind understanding, understanding false belief, has been consistently found to develop at around 3 or 4 years of age (e.g., Wimmer &amp; Perner, 1983). Another cognitive ability that develops at the approximately the same time is that of autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memory has been defined as "memory for information and events pertaining to the self" (Howe &amp; Courage, 1993, p. 306). There are also several theories explaining the onset of autobiographical memory. Two similar theories by Perner (1991) and Welch-Ross (1995) proposed that until a child possesses dual representational abilities (or theory of mind), they cannot form autobiographical memories. Nelson (1993) and Fivush (2001) have both proposed that autobiographical memory is developed through shared narratives with more experienced others (e.g., parents). There are several factors that have been found to contribute to theory of mind, emotion understanding, and autobiographical memory. Language abilities have been related to all three cognitive abilities (e.g., Slade &amp; Ruffman, 2005; Dunn &amp; Cutting, 1999; Harley &amp; Reese, 1999). Factors such as maternal talk, gender of the child, and the number of siblings the child has, have all been related to at least two of these abilities. In the current study, I addressed the relation between theory of mind understanding, emotion understanding, and autobiographical memory in three studies. The first study investigated the relations between language, theory of mind, emotion understanding, and mother-child talk about past events in 61 children at three 6- month intervals from 42- to 54- months of age. The second study also investigated these factors and the children&#65533;s pretense in 59 children at 48- months of age. In the second study, the mother&#65533;s theory of mind and emotion understanding were also measured. In the third study, I investigated the relations between theory of mind, emotion understanding and early memory recall in 73 adults, with an average age of 20 years. One key finding was that, despite theoretical predictions, there was no clear relation between theory of mind understanding and autobiographical memory in either children or adults. Results showed that theory of mind and emotion understanding are related but distinct abilities. The number of siblings, or the gender of the participants were not strongly related to theory of mind, autobiographical memory, or emotion understanding. Language abilities and maternal talk were the strongest factors related to the development of theory of mind, autobiographical memory and emotion understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">philosophy of mind</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070131.145223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Childhood amnesia : retrospective studies, prospective studies, and theoretical explanations</field><field name="creator">Wright, Fiona Katrina</field><field name="description">The overarching goal of this thesis was to examine aspects of childhood amnesia in children, adolescents, and adults, and to evaluate theoretical explanations for the phenomenon. The research addressed three main questions. First, at what age does the boundary of childhood amnesia occur in adults, and what is the shape of the boundary? Second, is it possible for children to verbally express preverbal aspects of their memories after a 6-year delay? Third, is maternal narrative style during early childhood related to the age of adolescents&#65533; earliest autobiographical memories? 
 In Experiment 1A, I examined whether the way in which we ask adults to sample their memories alters estimates of the offset of childhood amnesia. Independent groups of adults were asked to describe and date one memory from any time in their lives associated with each of six cue words (Lifespan Condition), one childhood memory associated with each of six cue words (Childhood Condition), or their earliest memory associated with each of six cue words (Cued Earliest Condition). A fourth group of adults was asked to describe and date their six earliest memories (Uncued Earliest Condition). As predicted, participants in the Cued Earliest and Uncued Earliest Conditions reported earlier memories than participants in the Childhood Condition, who in turn reported earlier memories than participants in the Lifespan Condition. Consistent with prior research, when adults were asked to report their earliest memories, with or without the use of cue words, the mean age of the earliest memory reported was between 3 and 4 years. 
 In Experiment 1B, I examined the distribution of the early memories reported by six individual adults by asking them to report all the memories that they could recall from each year of childhood, until they had reported at least their 20 earliest memories. When the number of memories recalled was plotted as a function of age at event, the distributions looked like step functions, with the step occurring at ages 4-6 years. Participants also reported some early memories for events that occurred before this age. 
 In Experiment 2, I examined children&#65533;s and parents&#65533; verbal and non-verbal recall for a specific event - the Magic Shrinking Machine - after a 6-year delay. The children were aged 27-51 months when they originally played with the machine. After a 6-year delay, nine of 46 children and 26 of 42 parents verbally recalled the event. There were no age-related differences in the amount or accuracy of the information that participants reported about the event. When children&#65533;s reports were compared to their task-relevant vocabulary measured at the time of the event, there were just two instances in which a child used a word to describe the event that had not been part of his or her productive vocabulary at the time of the event. Children showed no non-verbal recall of the event, relative to a group of age-matched controls. 
 In Experiment 3, I tested the hypothesis that the way that parents talk about the past with their children during early childhood will influence the age of these children&#65533;s earliest autobiographical memories when they are older. Conversations about past events between 17 mother-child dyads were recorded on multiple occasions between the children&#65533;s 2nd and 4th birthdays. When these children were between the ages of 12-13 years, they were asked to describe their earliest autobiographical memory. Adolescents whose mothers used a greater ratio of elaborations to repetitions when discussing the past with their child during early childhood had earlier first memories than did adolescents whose mothers used a smaller ratio of elaborations to repetitions. 
 The present findings on adults&#65533; earliest memories are consistent with a two-stage model of childhood amnesia. Theories that draw on multiple cognitive developments provide a more complete account of childhood amnesia than theories that focus on a single developmental milestone. I propose that neurological maturation and language acquisition set the stage for subsequent language-related developments that contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory and, ultimately, the offset of childhood amnesia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amnesia</field><field name="subject">memory in children</field><field name="subject">cognition in children</field><field name="subject">parent and child</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070201.112748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Westminster confession of faith and the cessation of special revelation</field><field name="creator">Milne, Garnet Howard</field><field name="description">The Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF), drawn up in London in the 1640s, has been one of the most influential confessions in the history of Reformed theology. It has occupied a very significant place in the life of a great many Protestant churches since the seventeenth century, and continues to serve as a chief subordinate standard in several major denominations today. 
 In the opening chapter of the Confession, the divines of Westminster included a clause which implied that there would no longer be any supernatural revelation from God for showing humankind the way of salvation. Means by which God had once communicated the divine will concerning salvation, such as dreams, visions, and the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, were said to be no longer applicable. However, many of the authors of the WCF accepted that "prophecy" continued in their time, and a number of them apparently believed that disclosure of God&#65533;s will through dreams, visions, and angelic communication remained possible. How is the "cessationist" clause of WCF 1:1 to be read in the light of these facts? Was it intended as a strict denial of the possibility that any supernatural revelation for the purposes of salvation could take place after the apostolic period, or did its authors, as some modern scholars have argued, allow for a more flexible view, in which such divine revelation through extraordinary means might still take place? This thesis explores these questions in the light of the modern debates over the interpretation of the Confession&#65533;s language and its implications for the church today. It considers the difference between "mediate" and "immediate" revelation as understood by the Westminster divines, and attempts to show that only "immediate" revelation was considered to have ceased, while "mediate" revelation, which always involved Scripture, was held to continue. 
 A detailed analysis of the writings of the Westminster divines reveals that these churchmen possessed both a strong desire to maintain the unity of Word and Spirit and a concern to safeguard the freedom of the Holy Spirit to speak to particular circumstances through the language and principles of Scripture. God still enabled predictive prophecy and spoke to individuals in extraordinary ways, but contemporary prophecy was held to be something distinct from the prophecy of New Testament figures. In the minds of both the Scottish Presbyterians and English Puritans, prophecy was considered to be an application of Scripture for a specific situation, not an announcement of new information not contained within the Bible. The Scriptures always remained essential for the process of discerning God&#65533;s will. 
 The Introduction to the thesis considers the debate over WCF 1:1 in its modern setting. Chapter One outlines the socio-political and theological context of the Westminster Assembly, and discusses the question of how to assess the respective contributions of the divines to the documents it produced. Chapter Two investigates the Westminster view of the necessity and scope of special revelation, and discusses the nature of the "salvation" which was conveyed by this means. Chapter Three surveys the exegetical traditions underpinning the teaching that former modalities of supernatural revelation had ceased. Chapter Four seeks to respond to modern claims that Puritan theology allowed for a "continuationist" position, by canvassing evidence both from seventeenth-century Reformed thinkers themselves and from their critics, who maintained that Westminster orthodoxy was indeed cessationist in style. Chapters Five and Six explore the claims to and explanations for "prophecy" in Reformed theology in both England and Scotland in the seventeenth century. Chapter Seven examines the question of the theological status of the Westminster Confession in its own time. To what extent were subscription requirements envisaged by the Assembly and the governments of the day, and what form did these requirements take? 
 The thesis concludes that the Westminster divines intended the cessationist clause to affirm that there was to be no more extra-biblical, "immediate" revelation for any purpose now that the church possessed the completed Scriptures. The written Word of God was fully capable of showing the way of "salvation" in its wider scope as either temporal or eternal deliverance. At the same time the divines did not intend to deny that God could still speak through special providences that might involve dreams or the ministry of angels, for example, but such revelation was always to be considered "mediate". The primary means was held to be the written Scriptures, illuminated by the Holy Spirit. The unity of the Word and Spirit was maintained, and God&#65533;s freedom to address individual circumstances remained intact.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Westminster Assembly (1643-1652)</field><field name="subject">Westminster Confession of Faith</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">History of doctrines</field><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church</field><field name="subject">creeds</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070201.162915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bedsharing vs cot-sleeping : an investigation of the physiology and behaviour of infants in the home setting</field><field name="creator">Baddock, Sally Anne</field><field name="description">Bedsharing between infants and parents interacts with many factors to increase the risk of SIDS, eg maternal smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, overtiredness, excessive bedding and younger infant. However, bedsharing also encourages breastfeeding, settles babies, reduces parental tiredness and increases mother-baby interactions. We studied infants in the natural setting of their own home, in their usual situation (bedsharing or cot-sleeping) to identify risks and benefits, and to understand how bedsharing could be made safer for all infants. 
 Methods: Overnight home video and physiological recordings of 40 bedshare infants (5-27 weeks), were compared with 40 cot infants matched for age and study season. Video data provided a log of infant/parent sleep positions, movements and interactions. The physiological recordings measured respiratory pattern, respiratory airflow, inspired CO2, oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate and core, peripheral and environmental temperatures. 
 Results: All infants maintained normal core temperatures overnight although bedshare infants had a higher shin temperature [35.43 vs 34.60&#176;C at 2hrs after sleep onset (difference 0.83, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.49)]. Bedshare infants had thicker bedding (RR:2.35 (95% CI:1.76 to 3.14) and more face covered time [0.9h/night vs 0.2 (RR:5.62, 95% CI: 3.08 to 10.25)]. Awakenings in the bedshare group were more common, of shorter duration, and caused less change in infant temperatures. 
 Exposure to &gt;3% CO2 occurred in 18 bedshare infants and 1 swaddled, cot-sleep infant. The maximum exposure time was the same for both groups (60mins). These levels of CO2 significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated breathing rate and maintained normal SaO2. Central apnoeas of 5-10 seconds resulted in drops in SaO2 &lt;90% (BS mean 6.8/night vs cot: 3.1, p&lt;0.001). SaO2 rarely fell below 85% and heart rate did not ever fall below 90bpm. 
 Bedshare infants commonly slept on their side, while cot infants slept supine. Prone sleeping was rare (BS:5 infants, 1.6-3.5h/night vs cot:2, 8.9-10.2) and for bedshare infants involved sleeping on mother&#65533;s chest. Bedshare infants woke and fed more frequently (mean wake times/night: 4.6 vs 2.5), but total sleep time was not different. Maternal checks were more frequent in the bedshare group (median:10, IQ range:7-23, max:55) than cot ( 4, 3-6, 16) and bedshare mothers frequently responded to infant initiated movements. During bedsharing baby and mother usually slept facing each other, touching, with infants at mothers&#65533; breast level. Father (or sibling) contact was rare. 
 Conclusions: Bedshare infants sleep in a warmer environment and experience more potentially dangerous events such as head-covering and rebreathing. However, all infants in this study maintained normal rectal temperature and SaO2 suggesting they were protected by homeostatic responses. Infant safety is also facilitated by frequent maternal checking and maternal responses to infant movements. The mother-infant proximity during bedsharing allows prompt responses, reduces time infants are upset, and minimises disruption from frequent breast feeding - aspects valued by many. It is not known if infants of smoking mothers or parents with impaired responses eg due to alcohol, respond adequately to the potentially dangerous situations identified. 
 Outcome: The results of this study will be used to formulate recommendations to parents for improving the safety of bedsharing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infants</field><field name="subject">sleep</field><field name="subject">parent and infant</field><field name="subject">sleeping customs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.113411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, values and Japanese tourism behaviour</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Leah</field><field name="description">While the role of culture as an influence on consumer behaviour and product/service choice has long been acknowledged, the current literature in marketing offers an incomplete understanding of how and why culture plays its influential role (Overby, Woodruff and Gardial 2005). Research suggests that values provide the link between culture and consumer behaviour and values have been the focus of much research in the social sciences. In particular, values have received significant attention in cross-cultural research, being used to characterise the similarities within and differences across cultures. Values are central to the marketing discipline as they determine value, i.e. what activities, interests, and material goods consumers identify with, enjoy, acquire, or consume (Grunert and Muller 1996). Both directly and indirectly, values drive consumption behaviour. 
 Typically, values have been assessed and compared through the use of standard measures such as Rokeach&#65533;s Value Survey, the List of Values and Schwartz&#65533;s Value Survey. Recent literature highlights growing concern over the application of standard measures across cultures and issues of cross-cultural invariance. There is a need for new research into cross-cultural applications of consumer value measures and theoretical models. This thesis critiques the use of Western conceptual paradigms and imposed etics in value research, and, using a Japanese tourism context, seeks a deeper understanding of how culture and values affect tourism consumption and experience. 
 This thesis offers an empirical test of the cross-cultural applicability of a commonly used values scale in consumer research, the List of Values (Kahle 1983). The findings of this phase of the research extend the literature concerning methodological issues in values research and highlight the limitiations of the LOV as a cross-cultural measure of values. Based on these findings the thesis adopts an alternative, qualitative methodology to investigate the relationship between Japanese culture, values and tourism behaviour in New Zealand. The findings of the second phase of the research contribute to a recent call in the literature for more qualitative research in tourism, and allow the identification and understanding of the key values relevant to Japanese tourism behaviour. The results of Means-End interviews with Japanese visitors reveal the important cultural assumptions informing values and shaping tourism decisions and behaviours for two key groups of Japanese tourists. 
 The theoretical framework presented in this thesis promotes our understanding of the relationship between cultural beliefs, values, and consumer behaviour. The results of the primary research highlight the importance of cultural and physical history, world-view, self-concept, thought patterns and language in the formation and interpretation of values. The thesis presents a holistic attempt at understanding Japanese culture, values and travel behaviour by examining how these concepts cohere in a logical framework. The thesis argues that, given the inherently cultural nature of values, their interpretation within the context of cultural beliefs is highly important in understanding variability in consumer behaviour across cultures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">tourists</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">social values</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070205.150926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing for theologia : governance of Presbyterian ministry formation in the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand 1961-1997</field><field name="creator">Jones, Susan Margaret</field><field name="description">This study of the governance of theological education examines significant policy and management decisions within Presbyterian ministry training in New Zealand between 1961 and 1997 in the light of Edward Farley&#65533;s integrated goal for theological education, theologia. Edward Farley&#65533;s argument that theologia, integration of theology (scientia) and theology (habitus), was fragmented from the first use of modern research university education as professional education for ordained ministry in the 1880s, provides a theoretical framework for analysing the influence of governance on theologia, through its effect on institutional organisation, structure and curricula. 
 International unease about theological education is reflected in New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation, though little sustained critical analysis is yet published in New Zealand. The period under study begins in 1961 when the Special Committee on Theological Training called for a Chair in Pastoral Theology to 1997 when the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand opened its Centre for Advanced Ministry Studies, later renamed the School of Ministry. 
 Criteria signifying recovery and/or fragmentation of theologia drawn from Farley&#65533;s arguments are searched for in the beginning of University theology at Berlin and the beginning of ministry formation in Dunedin, New Zealand. The intervening time till 1960 is similarly analysed. Governance decisions about Pastoral Theology in the first case study and governance decisions about University, church and theology in the second, are then assessed. Constant rearranging of pastoral theology programmes symptomises increasing fragmentation of theologia as does the creation of a Pastoral Chair. Pastoral theology is left with the integrative responsibility, rendering other disciplines more scientific as feared by some Theological Hall teachers. Outside the University from 1876-1946, New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation was still influenced by University expectations from Scotland and Berlin. After 1946, teaching within the University of Otago Faculty of Theology, Presbyterian teachers enjoyed considerable opportunities for integrated teaching. Fragmentation of theologia was therefore delayed and to some extent retarded. Increased University influence from 1992 meant these opportunities were lost. Finally, around the 1996 withdrawal of direct University engagement with Presbyterian ministry formation, formational goals were set for the Church&#65533;s new Centre of Advanced Ministry Studies. These aimed to integrate theology (scientia) and theology (habitus) retrospectively for ordinands after foundational theological education elsewhere. Earlier 1990s governance decisions affected achievement of these goals. 
 This work argues that between 1961 and 1997 most governance decisions in New Zealand Presbyterian ministry formation exacerbated existing structural fragmentation of theologia. Differing arrangements to alleviate this were attempted, and integration of (scientia) and (habitus) occurred for some students and at different periods. Structurally, however, the University-approved four-fold programme continued, making pastoral theology&#65533;s role remained ambiguous and theologia&#65533;s fragmentation inevitable. 
 While the New Zealand Presbyterian Church set its own ministry formation goals from 1961-1997, finance, prestige and educational philosophy prevented development of its own programme. Time and money were put into supporting University theology instead, and the University used to produce an educated ministry. It is now inevitable that the Church has to integrate theology (scientia) and theology (habitus) retrospectively for its students after theological education elsewhere.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">training of clergy</field><field name="subject">Pastoral theology</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070208.104312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Something to do with community structure : the influence of sampling and analysis on measures of community structure</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Barbara J.</field><field name="description">Diversity indices confound two components: species richness and evenness. Community structure should therefore be evaluated by employing separate measures of the number of species and their relative abundances. However, the relative abundances of species are dependent on the abundance measure used. Although the use of biomass or productivity is recommended by theory, in practice a surrogate measure is more often used. Frequency (local or relative) and point-quadrat cover provide two objective measures of abundance which are fast, less destructive and avoid problems associated with distinguishing individuals. However, both give discrete bounded data which may further alter the relative abundances of species. These measures have a long history of use and, as the need for objective information on biodiversity becomes more pressing, their use is likely to become more widespread. Consequently, it seems appropriate to investigate the effect of these abundance measures, and the resolution at which they are used, on calculated evenness. 
 Field, artificial and simulated data were used to investigate the effect of abundance measure and resolution on evidence for community structure. The field data consisted of seventeen sites. Sites from four vegetation types (saltmeadow, geothermal, ultramafic and high-altitude meadow) were sampled in three biogeographical regions. Most of the indices of community structure (species richness, diversity and evenness) detected differences between the different vegetation types, and different niche-apportionment models were fitted to the field data from saltmeadow and geothermal vegetation. Estimates of community structure based on local frequency and point-quadrat data differed. Local frequency tended to give higher calculated evenness; whereas point-quadrat data tended to fit to niche apportionment models where local frequency data failed. 
 The effect of resolution on the eighteen evenness indices investigated depended on community species richness and the particular index used. The investigated evenness indices were divided into three groups (symmetric, continuous and traditional indices) based on how they ranked real and artificially constructed communities. Contrary to Smith and Wilson&#65533;s recommendation the symmetric indices E[VAR] and E[Q] proved unsuitable for use with most types of plant data. In particular, E[Q] tends to assign most communities low values and has a dubious relationship with intrinsic evenness. The continuous indices, E[MS] and E[2,1], were the indices best able to discriminate between field, artificial and simulated communities, and their use should be re-evaluated. Traditional indices used with low resolution tended to elevate the calculated evenness, especially in species-rich communities. The relativized indices, E[Hurlbert] and EO[dis], were an exception, as they were always able to attain the minimum of zero; however, they were more sensitive to changes in resolution, particularly when resolution was low. Overall, traditional indices based on Hill&#65533;s ratios, including E[1/D] (=E[2,0]), and G[2,1] gave the best performance, while the general criticism of the use of Pielou&#65533;s J&#65533; as an index of evenness was further substantiated by this study. As a final recommendation, ecologists are implored to investigate their data and the likely effects that sampling and analysis have had on the calculated values of their indices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">statistical methods</field><field name="subject">sampling (statistics)</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070215.150836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender, family responsibilities and career success in the New Zealand accountancy profession</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Rosalind Heather</field><field name="description">This study contributes to an understanding of the causes, consequences and complexities of gender inequity in career success (high levels of status and salary) in the New Zealand accounting profession. Sixty-nine (twenty-seven male and forty-two female) experienced Chartered Accountants were interviewed about their career histories. A feminist, interpretative and qualitative approach was followed and NVIVO was used for analysis. The first significant contribution of the study was the identification of five work/family strategies based on levels of family and work involvement (Traditional Men, Traditional Women, Family Balancers, Stepping Stone Men and Work First Women). 
 Secondly, the level of family responsibilities explained career success much better than gender alone, although these two factors were commonly (but not always) directly related. 
 The third contribution was the revision of the three-pronged model previously offered by Whiting &amp; Wright (2001) to explain gender inequities in salary and status in the New Zealand accounting profession. Because the original model was derived from quantitative data, using qualitative data to revise the model constituted a sequential mixed method (pragmatic) approach. In the revised model, gender centrality and the three explanatory categories (Attributes, Structure and Attitudes) were removed. Career success was enhanced by high career aspirations (related to perceptions of stress, managerial and responsibility requirements and remuneration), long working hours and availability to clients, hard work, high technical competence and skills (enhanced by overseas experience), networking (less attractive to women), self-confidence (enhanced by mentoring for the least self-confident), flexibility to relocate if required (decreased by family and lifestyle ties) and large size and growth of the employing organisation. 
 Most influential were career aspirations and a long hours/available work ethic. This demonstrated the pervasiveness of the male linear career model (derived from the male breadwinner-female carer family structure), that rewarded (in terms of progression) unilateral allegiance to the firm. Career aspirations, desire for responsibility, perceived ability to handle pressure, long hours, availability to clients, networking and possibly technical skills (if there were periods of extended leave) were all influenced by the Chartered Accountant&#65533;s level of family responsibilities. Those with the least family responsibilities (childless, Traditional Men and Work First Women) demonstrated unswerving commitment to the firm and were equally the most successful career wise. 
 The impact of family responsibilities on career progression could be ameliorated by organisational cultural change. There were some indications of cultural change, being most prevalent in public sector and educational organisations. Enhancing conditions included a culture of flexibility and a concurrent atmosphere of trust, a less competitive work culture, absence of constant overtime demands and on-call work, encouraging top management who worked positively to retain and foster top performers over a longer period, and high level part-time positions supported by well-trained subordinate teams. To achieve these conditions provides an imminent challenge to organisations which employ Chartered Accountants, because the profession is increasing its proportion of females, has a younger generation more interested in work-life balance, and is losing many of its members overseas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">vocational guidance</field><field name="subject">work and family</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">success</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070214.145101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chromosome 18 and autoimmune disease</field><field name="creator">Hall, Richard James</field><field name="description">The autoimmune diseases embody a diverse range of common human conditions that are caused by a loss of self-tolerance in the host immune system to a specific organ or tissue type. Approximately 5% of the general population are affected by autoimmune diseases which include type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Graves disease (GD). The majority of the autoimmune diseases are multifactorial in origin, brought about by a combination of both environmental and genetic factors. Numerous susceptibility loci have been identified for each autoimmune disease and a number of these loci have been shown to be shared amongst the autoimmune diseases. The fine-mapping of susceptibility loci to the underlying disease genes remains the current challenge facing complex disease genetics. This project aimed to further characterise the autoimmune disease susceptibility locus IDDM6 on chromosome 18q12-21. This was achieved by using a comparative mapping approach that incorporates the study of genetic association in human autoimmune disease alongside the consomic mapping of the orthologous region in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of autoimmunity. 
 Deleted in colorectal carcinomas (DCC) provided a strong candidate gene at IDDM6 and the resident R201G polymorphism was identified as a functional candidate A potential mechanism for the R201G polymorphism involvement in T1D aetiology was identified where the polymorphism may affect the ability of DCC to induce apoptosis in vitro. However, no evidence for R201G association could be detected in autoimmune disease case-control datasets from the New Zealand (NZ) population (T1D n = 428, RA n = 730, autoimmune thyroid disease n = 192 (AITD); versus n = 1246 healthy controls). In addition, no evidence for R201G involvement in T1D could be provided in a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) incorporating 382 affected sib-pair families (54.2% transmission; P = 0.15). Significant association of R201G with GD was detected in a United Kingdom (UK) dataset (P = 0.002) from the Newcastle population (423 cases vs. 393 controls) but this was not replicated in an additional dataset from the UK Birmingham population (731 cases vs 668 controls; P = 0.81). It was concluded that the R201G polymorphism may encode susceptibility to GD but is unlikely to be the sole aetiological variant that accounts for the linkage previously observed at IDDM6 in autoimmune disease. To further investigate DCC as a positional candidate at IDDM6, five SNPs were selected from a 100 kb window surrounding a DCC-resident microsatellite that had previously been associated with T1D, called "88,21". The five SNPs were genotyped in the NZ T1D dataset, and the ascertainment of estimated haplotypes in this dataset revealed association of a rare haplotype with T1D, called haplotype H (3.31% cases vs 1.17% controls; P = 0.0044), in addition to global association of all haplotypes (P = 0.018). Haplotype H was also associated in an independent case-control dataset from the UK comprised of 400 T1D subjects and 443 healthy controls (P = 0.038). Maximum support for association of haplotype H was extended when both the UK and NZ T1D datasets were combined (P = 0.0017). Association of haplotype H could not be verified in a family-based test for association using the 382 UK T1D families (P = 0.40). However, the inclusion of the DCC SNPs in a TDT analysis of the published DCC-resident microsatellites "88,21" and "55,26", that had been used to identify IDDM6, extends support for the previously-associated 2-10 haplotype (2-10 refers to the published allele nomenclature at "88,21" and "55,26" respectively; 2-10-haplotype A; 59.6% T; P = 0.0058). There was no evidence for association of the five SNPs with RA or AITD when using either individual SNP analyses or estimated haplotypes in the NZ datasets. A similar lack of association was reported for the UK Newcastle GD dataset. Taken together, these data further support DCC, or a nearby gene, as conferring susceptibility to T1D. 
 The human genetic data that supports IDDM6 involvement in autoimmune disease is further strengthened by consomic mapping of the orthologous region in mouse, using the non-obese diabetic mouse (NOD) model of autoimmune disease. In this thesis, the first evidence for a diabetes and thyroiditis susceptibility locus on mouse chromosome 18 is presented, which have been designated Idd21 and Sat1 respectively. This was achieved by using a chromosome-replacement strain with chromosome 18 derived from the diabetes-resistant Biozzi ABH strain on a diabetes-susceptible NOD genome, called NOD.ABH[Chr&#65533;&#8312;]. Mouse chromosome 18 contains orthology to both IDDM6 and the rat diabetes-susceptibility locus Iddm3. The NOD.ABH[Chr&#65533;&#8312;] mice showed a dramatic and significant reduction in diabetes incidence (30% of females were affected by 7 months of age versus 85% in NOD; P &lt;0.0001) and that of thyroiditis (15.5% at 12 months compared to 37.4% in NOD; P &lt;0.002). 
 The comparative mapping of the chromosome 18 autoimmune susceptibility locus IDDM6 in human and mouse presented in this thesis provides further support for this locus. This research also clearly defines the next steps required to fine-map IDDM6 to the underlying disease genes, especially in regard to the DCC gene.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromosomes</field><field name="subject">autoimmune diseases</field><field name="subject">immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.141018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The velocity field of the South Island of New Zealand derived from GPS and terrestrial measurements</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">The measurements from eighteen GPS (Global Positioning System) surveys and four terrestrial surveys were used to calculate the velocities of 406 survey stations throughout the South Island, Stewart Island and the southernmost North Island. Repeated GPS measurements are available at 350 stations. The calculation of the velocities for the remaining stations is made possible through the use of terrestrial measurements. 
 The velocity was modelled under the assumption that the displacements of the stations are either linear with time or linear punctuated by discontinuities. The discontinuous model was used to estimate the coseismic displacements of stations in the vicinity of the 1994 Arthur&#65533;s Pass earthquake (M 6.7). The maximum station displacement was estimated to be ca. 40 cm, and significant displacements are seen to a range of ca. 70 km from the earthquake epicentre. Station displacements were also calculated for two later earthquakes in the vicinity of the Arthur&#65533;s Pass earthquake, but it was not possible to separate these from the postseismic displacements due to the earlier earthquake. 
 A continuous velocity field was estimated from the discrete station velocity measurements through a stochastic model based on the concept of minimum curvature. The selection of the basic stochastic model was effectively arbitrary; however, the model was refined to better suit the velocity field in the South Island. This was achieved through estimating the correlation between the velocity components (east and north) and the anisotropy of the velocity field. The stochastic model has the advantage over other models (e.g. polynomials or splines) in that only the probable shape of the velocity field is assumed. Therefore, the shape of the velocity field is not restricted by a priori model assumptions. 
 The measurement of the differential velocity across the South Island plate boundary between Christchurch and Cape Farewell is less than 85% of the interplate velocity calculated from NUVEL-1A. One possibility is that the NUVEL-1A model may not be an accurate representation of the motion at this plate boundary. Alternatively, deformation (occurring during the period of survey measurements) may extend a total distance of 150 km or more (assuming that the spatial velocity differential is less than 5x10&#8315;&#8311;/year) offshore from Christchurch and Cape Farewell. In the southern South Island there is evidence for as much as 22 mm/year of east directed motion being accommodated between Fiordland&#65533;s west coast and the stable interior of the Australian Plate. An accretionary wedge has been imaged west of Fiordland (Davey and Smith, 1983; Delteil et al., 1996); therefore, some of this deformation may be related to slip on the subduction interface. 
 The shear strain rates are clearly influenced by the dominant fault elements in the South Island, i.e. the southern and central Alpine Fault, and the eastern Hope Fault. The maximum measured shear strain rate in the South Island, 6(&#177;1) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year, occurs adjacent to the Alpine Fault at (1 70.5&#176;E, 43.3&#176;S), ca. 40 km northeast of Mt Cook, and is coincident with a local dilatational strain rate minimum, -7 (&#177;4.5) x 10&#8315;&#8312;/year. This is the only location where the measured strain rate is compatible with strike-slip and dip-slip motion on the Alpine Fault. Shear strain rates decrease eastwards along the Hope Fault: from 5(&#177;0.7) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year at the Alpine Fault, to 3(&#177;0.8) x10&#8315;&#8311;/year close to the Jordan Thrust. The zone of deformation broadens with a concomitant decrease in shear strain rate, such that within the northeast South Island there is no distinct maximum over any particular fault. 
 A band of contraction and shear has been imaged at a distance of 100 km southeast of, and parallel to, the Alpine Fault. The deformation at this location may be related to a frontal thrust zone similar to that described in the two-sided wedge models. The band of deformation continues north of Christchurch, intersecting the Porters Pass Fault Zone. 
 Significant contraction rates are seen in the measurements from four other zones. The first of these is situated towards the northeast (on land) ends of the Clarence, Awatere and Hope Faults. Some of this signal is presumably related to the uplift of the Seaward and Inland Kaikoura Ranges. The three remaining zones of significant negative dilatational strain rate are located north of the Wairau Fault, close to Jackson Bay and within central Otago. 
 A zone of significant shear strain rate is measured along the eastern side of, and within southern Fiordland. The deformation measurements probably partially reflect the existence of an important fault running through Lake Te Anau, which accommodates the motion of the Fiordland block relative to the Pacific Plate. The remainder may be due to internal deformation of the Fiordland block. 
 A new velocity differential measurement has been introduced, the rotational excess. This function of the shear strain rate, vorticity and dilatational strain rate should be sensitive to tectonic rotation (as measured by paleomagnetic data). Point estimates of the rotational excess are insignificant throughout the South Island. Also, there are no easily defined regions in which spatially averaged measurements are significant. If the rotational excess is assumed to be a direct measurement of tectonic rotation then the measurements place a bound on the size of the region and the rate at which it rotates. For example, the rate of tectonic rotation within a square region with side lengths of 50 km located adjacent to Cape Campbell is unlikely to be greater than 4&#176;/Ma. However, greater tectonic rotation rates are possible within smaller regions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">South Island (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.143821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The association of Escherichia coli and soil particles in overland flow</field><field name="creator">Muirhead, Richard William</field><field name="description">The entrainment of microbes from agricultural land into overland flow during rainfall events is recognised as an important source of pathogenic microbes to surface water bodies and yet this transport process is poorly understood. In this study, a method has been developed to separate bacteria into the forms in which they have been postulated to exist in overland flow. Then Escherichia coli was used as a model organism to investigate the transported state of bacteria eroded from cowpats and their subsequent transport in overland flow. Simulated rainfall experiments were used to generate runoff direct from cowpats. Concentrations of E. coli in the runoff direct from cowpats were found to be directly proportional to the concentration in the cowpat, regardless of the age of the cowpat. It was also observed that E. coli were predominantly eroded from cowpats as individual cells. The interactions between E. coli and soil particles in overland flow were then examined in a small laboratory scale model system and showed that E. coli attached to large (&gt;45 [mu]m) soil particles were transported significantly less than unattached cells. However, in the runoff from the model system, E. coli were found to be attached mainly to clay particles that were similar in size to the bacterial cells. Furthermore, the transport of E. coli through the model system appeared to follow the transport of a conservative chemical tracer implying that (a) the cells were being transported as a solute with the bulk of the water flow, and (b) that E. coli attached to small clay particles were as mobile in the overland flow as unattached cells. These observations imply that E. coli predominantly interact with small clay particles that are also being carried along in the overland flow. The transport of E. coli at a larger scale was then investigated using 5-metre long, 1-metre wide buffer strips operated under saturation excess conditions. In buffer strips using intact soils and existing pasture cover, E. coli removal was very poor (26 % removal) at the low flow rate of 2 L min&#8315;&#65533; with no removal observed at the higher flow rates of 6 and 20 L min&#8315;&#65533;. E. coli removal rates were increased to 41 % removal at 2 L min&#8315;&#65533; by cultivating the soils, with the removal rate again decreasing with increasing flow rate. E. coli in the overland flow from the buffer strips did not form into large flocs or attach to large soil particles, but were transported in small neutrally buoyant particles that remain entrained in the overland flow. Under saturation excess runoff conditions, E. coli in overland flow were not effectively removed by buffer strips as the small particles are transported either over the soil surface or, through large pores in the soil. This Thesis has shown that E. coli is transported in overland flow in small particle sizes that are difficult to trap or remove from overland flow thereby explaining the high fluxes of faecal bacteria observed in overland flow from agricultural land.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">pathogenic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">agricultural wastes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070306.155953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Axillary odour in apparel textiles</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Rachel</field><field name="description">The axilla is a major source of human body odour from which the characteristic musky, urinous or acidic odours emanate, and are predominantly due to bacterial metabolism of the protein-rich fluid secreted by the apocrine and sebaceous glands located in this area (Senol and Fireman, 1999). Clothing has been implicated in contributing to body odour intensity, possibly even increasing the intensity (Dravnieks, et al., 1968; Shelley, et al., 1953) by the transfer of secretions, skin debris and bacteria from the body to the fabric substrate. Despite much anecdotal evidence indicating that some fibres and fabrics are better at limiting odour intensity than others, there appears to be no published research confirming this. The purpose of this study therefore, was to determine whether fabrics varying in fibre content (cotton, wool, polyester) and fabric knit structure (interlock, single jersey, 1x1 rib) differed in the extent to which they retained and emanated axillary odour following wear, and whether the intensity of odour was linked to the number of bacteria transferred to the fabrics. A procedure for collecting odour on fabrics was developed as was a method for evaluating odour through use of a sensory panel. Total aerobic bacteria and aerobic coryneform bacteria extracted from the fabrics were counted to determine if an association between bacterial counts and fabrics existed. Sensory analysis recognises the unique capability of humans as odour-detecting instruments whereas, instrumental analysis has the potential to offer information on the concentration and identification of axillary compounds, which a human assessor cannot. To investigate a new method for detecting axillary odour on apparel fabrics, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to analyse volatiles emitted from fabrics differing in fibre type. 
 After removal of garments from the human body, axillary odour can be detected on fabrics, with the intensity of odour being strongly influenced by the fibre type from which the fabrics had been made. Polyester fabrics emanated odour of high intensity, cotton that of mid-low odour intensity, and wool fabrics were low odour. Fabric structural properties such as thickness, mass per unit area and openness of knit structure also had an effect on odour intensity. However, as the principal factor influencing odour intensity was fibre, only fabrics characterised by a high intensity (i.e. polyester) were influenced by structural properties. Differences in odour intensity among fabrics were not necessarily related to bacterial numbers, and no &#65533;inherent antimicrobial&#65533; properties were evident for any of the fabrics. Bacterial populations persisted in all fabrics up to 28 days. A decline in numbers was apparent for high-odour polyester fabrics, while numbers in low-odour wool fabrics remained relatively stable. PTR-MS detected compounds likely to be short-chain carboxylic acids which increased in the headspace above the polyester fabrics after 7 days. However, this increase was not evident for either the wool or cotton fabrics. Therefore, bacterial numbers per se cannot be a predictor of the odour intensity emanating from fabrics at least on the basis of these fabrics and fibres. The intensity of axillary odour emanating from fabrics was found inversely related to fibre hygroscopicity.

Gigi</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s fourteen deep-water fiords have complex physical and hydrographic features as well as strong environmental gradients, all of which may influence the population structure of organisms that inhabit the fiords. I examined the population structure of the brachiopod Terebratella sanguinea over ecological and evolutionary time scales in relation to physical and hydrographic features of the fiords. To further explore the role of larval dispersal in this system, comparisons between population genetic structure of T. sanguinea and a brachiopod with a contrasting larval dispersal strategy (Liothyrella neozelanica) were made. 
 Aspects of the life history of the articulate brachiopod Terebratella sanguinea were measured. I measured density and size throughout Doubtful Sound and growth at outer (5 km from outer coast) and inner fiord sites (13.5 km from outer coast). Additionally, reproductive periodicity was measured at a single site within Doubtful Sound. Terebratella sanguinea occurred at significantly lower densities and was significantly smaller at the outer fiord site (p &lt; 0.05), however growth rates between an inner and outer fiord site did not differ significantly. Terebratella sanguinea was found to have separate sexes and synchronous maturation of oocytes with spawning occurring in the austral winter. These results indicated that, on an ecological time scale, the environmental gradient of the fiords influences aspects of T. sanguinea population structure. 
 In order to determine the influence of the fiord environment on genetic population structure, patterns among T. sanguinea from across Fiordland were assessed using two genetic markers, and these data were compared to hydrodynamic variables. Ten sites (322 individuals) were included in a preliminary allozyme analysis, and 20 sites (358 individuals) were used for the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Patchy genetic differentiation was revealed with both markers, and a break between Long Sound and the other Fiordland sites was detected with AFLP markers. My results suggest hydrodynamic features of this region may isolate organisms that can disperse only during a planktonic larval phase, however this isolation is visible in genetic patterns only at the most extreme values of the hydrodynamic variables. 
 To better understand how the fiord environment influences population structure of organisms that disperse via planktonic larvae, I compared population genetic structure of two sympatric brachiopod species that differ in planktonic larval duration. Genetic analysis using the AFLP technique revealed population structuring corresponding to the contrasting modes of larval dispersal. AMOVA analysis indicated Liothyrella neozelanica, a brachiopod that broods its larvae, had more limited exchange among sites within a fiord than did T. sanguinea, a brachiopod that does not brood its larvae. In general, the fiord hydrographic conditions may be creating opportunities for local genetic differentiation (for example Long Sound) in organisms capable of longer distance dispersal, but organisms with lower potential for dispersal are more strongly influenced by ontogeny than by hydrography. 
 Understanding the population structure of some of the marine fauna of Fiordland is an important cornerstone for the developing management plan for the area. Conservation of the underwater resources of this World Heritage Area can be successful if the structure of the system and the mechanisms driving this structure are taken into account.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brachiopoda</field><field name="subject">larvae</field><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Doubtful Sound</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070308.144342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double-TOP trap for ultracold atoms</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The Double-TOP trap is a new type of magnetic trap for neutral atoms, and is suitable for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and evaporatively cooled atoms. It combines features from two other magnetic traps, the Time-averaged Orbiting Potential (TOP) and Ioffe-Pritchard traps, so that a potential barrier can be raised in an otherwise parabolic potential. The cigar-like cloud of atoms (in the single-well configuration) is divided halfway along its length when the barrier is lifted. 
 A theoretical model of the trap is presented. The double-well is characterised by the barrier height and well separation, which are weakly coupled. The accessible parameter space is found by considering experimental limits such as noise, yielding well separations from 230 [mu]m up to several millimetres, and barrier heights from 65 pK to 28 [mu]K (where the energies are scaled by Boltzmann&#65533;s constant). Potential experiments for Bose-Einstein condensates in this trap are considered. 
 A Double-TOP trap has been constructed using the 3-coil style of Ioffe-Pritchard trap. Details of the design, construction and current control for these coils are given. Experiments on splitting thermal clouds were carried out, which revealed a tilt in the potential. Two independent BECs were simultaneously created by applying evaporative cooling to a divided thermal cloud. 
 The Double-TOP trap is used to form a linear collider, allowing direct imaging of the interference between the s and d partial waves. By jumping from a double to single-well trap configuration, two ultra-cold clouds are launched towards a collision at the trap bottom. The available collision energies are centred on a d-wave shape resonance so that interference between the s and d partial waves is pronounced. Absorption imaging allows complete scattering information to be collected, and the images show a striking change in the angular distribution of atoms post-collision. The results are compared to a theoretical model, verifying that the technique is a useful new way to study cold collisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensation</field><field name="subject">magnetic traps</field><field name="subject">nuclear optical potentials</field><field name="subject">laser cooling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070321.160859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plasma volume and the physiological response to sodium loading in men and women</field><field name="creator">Sims, Stacy Teresa</field><field name="description">The metabolic heat generated by exercise must be dissipated to maintain body temperature within narrow physiological limits; during exercise and heat exposure, body water is lost via sweating to enable evaporative cooling of the body. When sweating takes place, total body water is reduced (without the intake of additional fluids) from each fluid compartment due to the free exchange of water between compartments with a concomitant loss of electrolytes, primarily sodium. A series of three investigations were undertaken to evaluate: 1) the efficacy of acute sodium citrate-chloride loading on endurance trained males and females as a viable means to expand extracellular fluid volume, 2) any menstrual cycle effects on renal handling of this sodium load at rest, and 3) if any subsequent hypervolaemia reduces the physiological strain of exercise in warm conditions in both genders. The first investigation examined eight endurance-trained (VO&#8322;[max]: 58 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533; (SD 5); 36 y (SD 11)) runners in a randomized double-blind crossover study.

At equivalent times before exercise termination, HighNa&#8314; also involved lower core temperature (38.9 vs. 39.3&#65533;C; P = 0.00) and perceived exertion (P = 0.01), and a tendency for lower heart rate (164 vs. 174 bpm; P = 0.08). 
 The main purpose of the second investigation was to investigate the efficacy of an acute sodium load on endurance trained women&#65533;s plasma volume and renal mechanisms across the menstrual cycle at rest. This was evaluated by inducing a sodium-mediated plasma volume expansion using HighNa&#8314; at rest during the last high hormone week of the OCP cycle (HH[ocp]) or the late-luteal phase of the natural cycle (LUT[nat]) and during the low hormone sugar pill week of the OCP cycle (SUG[ocp]) or during the early follicular phase of the natural cycle (FOL[nat]. Thirteen women completed the study with one woman on a progestin-only pill (results were used for case study, not statistical analyses) and were assigned to one of two groups: 1) control (NAT, n = 6, 24 y (SD 5), 53 ml&#65533;kg&#65533;ml&#8315;&#65533; (SD 3)) or oral contraceptive pill (OCP, n = 6, progestin only n = 1, 29 y (SD 6), 51 ml&#65533;kg&#65533;ml&#8315;&#65533; (SD 2)) group according to their usage status. Across the four-hour post loading time there was greater plasma volume expansion in SUG[ocp] and FOL[nat] vs. LUT[nat] and HH[ocp] (5.06% (SD1.16) vs. 3.35% (SD 0.23), P = 0.02). OCP usage did not reliably alter the hypervolaemic response (P = 0.27), and this was not dependent on phase of cycle (P = 0.32). Plasma volume expansion occurred across both types and phases of the menstrual cycle with evidence that estradiol interactions with AVP, P[osm] and body water retention are stronger in the low hormone phase of the OCP than in the follicular phase of the natural cycle; illustrated by greater overall water retention after an acute sodium+water load. 
 The third investigation was conducted during the high hormone phase of both OCP and NAT menstrual cycles to further examine sodium-loading effects on the physiological capacity of exhaustive cycling in warm conditions. Thirteen endurance-trained (VO&#8322;[peak] 52 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533; (SD 2); 26 y (SD 6), 60.8 kg (SD 5), mean (SD)) cyclists completed this double-blind, crossover experiment during the high hormone phase of the menstrual cycle. Cyclists ingested a concentrated sodium (HighNa&#8314;: 164 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) or low-sodium (LowNa&#8314;: 10 mmol Na&#8314;&#65533;L&#8315;&#65533;) beverage (10 ml&#65533;kg&#8315;&#65533;) before cycling to exhaustion at 70% VO&#8322;[max] in warm conditions (32&#65533;C, 50% RH, V[a]~5.6 m&#65533;s&#8315;&#65533;). HighNa&#8314; increased PV before exercise, similar to that of the men in the first investigation, whereas LowNa&#8314; didn&#65533;t (4.4% (SD 1.2) vs. -1.9% (SD 1.3); P &lt; 0.0001), and involved greater time to exhaustion (98.6 min (SD 25.6) vs. 78.5 min (SD 24.6); P &lt; 0.0001). There was a higher baseline core temperature and faster rate of change for HH[ocp] for both beverage conditions (HighNa&#8314;: 37.15 (SD 0.6) vs. 36.92&#65533;C (SD 0.4); P = 0.05, LowNa&#8314;: 37.04 (SD 0.6) vs. 36.90&#65533;C (SD 0.4), P = 0.05; HH[ocp] vs. LUT[nat], respectively). Through this series of investigations a greater understanding was achieved of fluid balance and the effect of pre-exercise hypervolaemia between genders; pre-exercise ingestion of a concentrated sodium beverage increased plasma volume before exercise and involved less thermoregulatory and the actual and perceived physiological strain during exercise and increased endurance in warm conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium in the body</field><field name="subject">blood plasma</field><field name="subject">endurance sports</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.143047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia pakari mai nga niho : oral health outcomes, self-report oral health measures and oral health service utilisation among Maori and non-Maori</field><field name="creator">Koopu, Pauline Irihaere</field><field name="description">Health is determined by the past as well as the present; the health status of indigenous peoples has been strongly influnced by the experience of colonisation and their subsequent efforts to participate as minorities in contemporary society while retaining their own ethnic and cultural identities. Colonial journays may have led to innovation and adaptation for Maori, but they have also created pain and suffering from which full recovery has yet to be felt (Durie, 2001). 
 The oral health area can be described as having considerable and unacceptable disparities between Maori and non-Maori (Broughton 1995; Thomson, Ayers and Broughton 2003). Few reports have been conducted concerning Maori and patterns of oral health service utilisation, however a lower service utilisation among Maori than non-Maori has been noted (TPK 1996; Broughton and Koopu 1996). Overall, Maori oral health is largely unknown due to a paucity of appropriate research. 
 This research aims to provide new information by describing Maori oral health outcomes over the life course, within a Kaupapa Maori Research (KMR) methodology. In general, the basic tenets presented for KMR are: (1) to prioritise Maori - from the margin to the centre; (2) to be Maori controlled - by Maori, for Maori; (3) to reject &#65533;victim-blame&#65533; theories; and (4) to be a step towards action and change in order to improve Maori oral health outcomes. 
 The aims of this research are to: 
 1. Describe the occurrence of caris at ages 5, 15, 18 and 26 and periodontal disease at age 26 years for Maori. 
 2. Describe self-reported oral health, self-reported dental aesthetics and oral health service utilisation among Maori at ages 5, 15, 18 and 26. 
 3. Compare the above oral health characteristics between Maori and non-Maori . 
 4. Investigate the determinants of any differences in oral health outcomes between Ma&#772;ori and non-Maori using a KMR methodology. 
 The investigation involves a secondary analysis of data from the Dunedin multidisciplinary Health and Development study (DMHDS). The existing data-set was statistically analysed using SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). Descriptive statistics were generated. The levels of statistical significance were set at P&lt; 0.05. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions and independent sample t-tests or ANOVA were used for comparing means. 
 A summary of the Maori/non-Maori analysis shows that, for a cohort of New Zealanders followed over their life-course, the oral health features of caries prevalence, caries severity, and periodonal disease prevalence are higher among Maori compared to non-Maori. In particular, it appears that while Maori females did not always have the highest prevalence of dental caries, this group most often had a higher dmfs/DMFS for dental caries, compared to non-Maori. As adolescents and adults, self-reported results of oral health and dental appearance indicate that Maori males were more likely to report below average oral health and below average dental appearance, when compared to non-Maori. However, at age 26, non-Maori males made up the highest proportion of episodic users of oral health services. 
 This study has a number of health implications: these relate specifically to the management of dental caries, the access to oral health services, and Maori oral health and the elimination of disparities. These are multi-levelled and have implications for health services across the continuum of care from child to adult services; they also have public health implications that involve preventive measures and the broader determinants of health; and involve KMR principles than can be applied to oral health interventions and dental health research in general. 
 Dental diseases and oral health outcomes, such as dental anxiety and episodic use of services, are a common problem in a cohort of New Zealanders with results demonstrating ethnic disparities between Maori and on-Maori. As an area of dentistry that has had very little research in New Zealand, the findings of this study provide important information with which to help plan for population needs. 
 The KMR approach prioritises Maori and specifically seeks to address Maori oral health needs and the elimination of disparities in oral health outcomes. While the issues that are raised may be seen as the more difficult to address, they are also more likely to achieve oral health gains for Maori and contribute to the elimination of disparities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="subject">dental public health</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.152634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditional ecological knowledge and harvest management of Titi (Puffinus griseus) by Rakiura Maori</field><field name="creator">Kitson, Jane C</field><field name="description">Rakiura Maori continue a centuries old harvest of titi chicks (sooty shearwater, Puffinus griseus) which is governed primarily by Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The sustainability of titi harvesting is of high cultural, social and ecological importance. Some commentators view contemporary use of TEK as insufficient to ensure sustainability because it is no longer intact, too passive, and/or potentially inadequate to meet new ecological and technical challenges. Such assertions have been made in the absence of detailed description of TEK and associated social mechanisms. This thesis describes Rakiura Maori TEK practices and management systems that are in place and asks whether such systems are effective today, and whether they will remain effective in future. 
 Ecological, social and cultural factors are intertwined in cultural wildlife harvests so the methodology used was a combination of quantitative ecological methods and semi-directive interviews of 20 experienced harvesting elders. The research also used ecological science to evaluate potential harvest monitoring methods and to determine what sets the limits on harvest. These ecological studies focused on harvesting by four families on Putauhinu Island in 1997-1999. 
 Harvest is divided into two parts. In the first period (&#65533;nanao&#65533;) chicks are extracted from breeding burrows during daytime. In the second period (&#65533;rama&#65533;) chicks are captured at night when they have emerged from burrows. Nanao harvest rates only increased slightly with increasing chick densities and birders&#65533; harvest rates varied in their sensitivities to changing chick density. Although harvest rates can only provide a general index of population change a monitoring panel, with careful selection of participants, may be the only feasible way to assess population trend and thereby harvest sustainability or the resource&#65533;s response to changed management. 
 Rakiura Maori harvesting practice constitutes common property resource management based on birthright and a system of traditional rules. Protection of island habitat and adult birds, and temporal restricitions on harvest are considered most important. Legislation and a belief system of reciprocity and connection to ancestors and environment aid enforcement of the rules. 
 Ecological knowledge is learnt through observation, hands-on experience and storytelling. Younger Rakiura Maori now spend less time harvesting which puts pressure on the transmission of knowledge. Paradoxically, use of modern technology for harvesting aids transfer of essential skills because it is easier and faster to learn, thereby contributing to the continuance of a culturally important harvest. 
 Limits on harvest are passive, with the numbers of chicks taken determined by the time spent harvesting and processing. Processing is more limiting during the rama period. Future innovations that decrease the time to process each chick during rama could greatly increase the total number of chicks caught. Recently introduced motorised plucking machines decrease the time required to pluck each chick. However, on Putauhinu Island, use of plucking machines did not increase the number of chicks harvested, indicating social mechanisms were also limiting. Elders identified changing values between the generations, which may reduce the future strength of social limitations on harvest pressure. 
 Global climate change may reduce the predicability of traditional knowledge. Rakiura Maori have identified this risk and sought to examine ecological science as a tool to complement traditional knowledge for monitoring harvest sustainability. Climate change, declining ti&#772;ti&#772; numbers and potential changes in technology or markets all threaten the effectiveness of current social limits to harvest. Rakiura Maori have previously shown the ability to adapt and must look to add resilience to their institutions to ensure we keep the titi forever.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Sooty shearwater</field><field name="subject">Titi</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="subject">ethnozoology</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.153344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are cultural impact assessments a tool for collaborative management?</field><field name="creator">Vanstone, Anita Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the participation of Maori (New Zealand&#65533;s indigenous people) in the impact assessment process. Traditionally, Maori have had limited involvement in the management of New Zealand&#65533;s environment. One possible solution to this could be through the adoption of a collaborative management framework. Unfortunately, there is limited information and research on tools that could facilitate collaborative management between iwi and applicants for resource consent (including, developers, planning consultants and local authorities). Therefore, this research attempts to fill in a gap in current literature and to investigate the potential of the cultural impact assessment as a tool for collaborative management. 
 Despite some criticisms of collaborative management, there are examples where this form of communicative planning has resulted in a very positive outcome for indigenous groups. Therefore, the specific aim of this research is to analyse the extent to which cultural impact assessments can be used as a tool to promote collaborative management between iwi and applicants. 
 In achieving the research objectives of the thesis, the theoretical background of collaborative management and impact assessment theories are explored. In addition, democracy and participation theories are also investigated. In particular, in the discussion of these theories emphasis is placed on the potential involvement of indigenous peoples. The thesis argues that the application of collaborative management via the use of cultural impact assessments may potentially increase Maori involvement in planning. 
 Analysis of collaborative management and impact assessment theories is supported by empirical research. This includes; 1) an exploration of the New Zealand setting for the two theories, 2) a content analysis of cultural impact assessments from eight different iwi authority in New Zealand, and 3) a case study analysis of two iwi organizations that have an established system for undertaking cultural impact assessments (Kai Tahu ki Otago and the Wellington Tenths Trust). 
 The research finds that cultural impact assessments are very similar to other impact assessment reports. However, they should be viewed as evolving documents, as there are some areas of the assessment process that need to be improved upon. 
 The research concludes by suggesting that cultural impact assessments do have the potential to be a tool for collaborative management between iwi and applicants. Further research and education in relation to the content, value and process of cultural impact assessments is required. It is also argued that increased resourcing, training and legislative requirements are needed to further increase Maori participation in planning.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">co-management</field><field name="subject">environmental management</field><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.113743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology and ethnobotany of karaka (Corynocarpus Laevigatus)</field><field name="creator">Stowe, C. J. (Christopher James)</field><field name="description">Historically there has been considerable debate over the origin of karaka (Corynocarpus laevigatus J.R. et G. Forst.) In contrast, the extent and importance of pre-historic arboriculture in New Zealand has received little attention in the literature. This study reviews the ecology and ethnobotony of karaka and investigates its cultural and natural biogeography. 
Maori migration traditions frequently state that karaka was introduced to New Zealand. However, molecular evidence and finds of fossil seeds of the late Oligocene age show that karaka is endemic to New Zealand. Therefore, Maori traditions probably relate to the translocation and cultivation of karaka within the New Zealand region, for which there is abundant anecdotal evidence. Karaka fruits were a valuable addition to the Maori diet and were likely to have functioned as a replacement for traditional Polynesian precedents and entailed a rigorous regime of steaming and soaking to rid the kernal of its toxic elements. There is data to suggest selection for fruit size and/or nutritional value in cultivated karaka populations. 
A database of karaka distribution was compiled and populations classified as &#65533;cultural&#65533; or &#65533;unknown&#65533; on the basis of spatial association with archaeological sites. Groves classed as cultural were assumed to be cultivated or translocated by pre-historic Maori. Lack of effective seed dispersal by birds and the longevity of the trees, mean that the contemporary distribution of karaka provides a reasonable template for the extent of its prehistoric translocation and cultivation within New Zealand. 
Karaka has a distinct cultural and natural biogeography. The greatest overlap between cultural and unknown trees occurred in the northern North Island while the majority of trees in the lower North Island, and all trees in the South Island were classed as cultural. Prior to the arrival of Polynesians in New Zealand, karaka was probably restricted in distribution to the Northland/Auckland region. Its natural range was then extended by human translocation and cultivation to the lower North Island, South Island, Kermadec Islands, Chatham Islands and many other in-shore islands off New Zealand. 
 Climate variables were fitted to the distribution data and discriminant analysis used to further test the classification of karaka into cultural and unknown populations. Significant differences were found in climatic parameters between groups. Cultural karaka were found in enviroments with greater solar radiation seasonality, higher evaporative demands and greater soil moisture deficits than unknown karaka. The climate profile of karaka is biased towards the same environmental correlates of pa and pit site locations, further indicating that karaka was a cultivated tree crop. 
It is concluded that the importance and extent of karaka arboriculture, and probably that of other endemic tree species currently restricted to the northern North Island of cultural karaka is biased towards the same environmental correlates of pa and pit site locations, further indicating that karaka was a cultivated tree crop. 
The extensive translocation of karaka by Maori means that it has the potential, with the application of molecular methods, to serve as a marker for prehistoric settlement and mobility. Preliminary work was begun on this aspect and a predictive model is presented of the possible relationships within and between populations of karaka. 
It is concluded that the importance and extent of karaka arboriculture, and probably that of other endemic tree species, has previously been overlooked. This has implications for our view of certain plant communities as unmodified by humans, and provides an impetus to protect surface vegetation as an integral part of some prehistoric archaeological sites.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Karaka</field><field name="subject">Corynocarpus laevigatus</field><field name="subject">ethnobotany</field><field name="subject">ethnobiology</field><field name="subject">Ra&#772;kau whakaruruhau</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.114356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultures of collecting: Maori curio collecting in Murihiku, 1865-1975</field><field name="creator">Samson, J.O. (James Oliver)</field><field name="description">The ambivalence of many prehistorians toward curio collections has meant that, although they recognise some of their shortcomings, they nevertheless use collections as if they had qualities of archaeological assemblages. In this dissertation it is posited and then demonstrated that curio collections are very different entities to archaeological assemblages. In order to use collections in valid constructions of New Zealand&#65533;s pre-European past, the processes that led to their formation need to be understood. It is only then that issues of representation can be addressed. 
 In order to better understand the collecting process, a study of the activity of 24 curio collectors who operated in the Murihiku region of southern New Zealand during the period between 1865 and 1975 was undertaken. The study was structured about two key notions: the idea of the &#65533;filter&#65533; and the idea that tools and ornaments have a &#65533;life history&#65533; that extends from the time that raw material was selected for the manufacture to the present. The notion of the filter made possible a determination of the effects of particular behaviours on patterns of collector selectivity and the extent and nature of provenance recording; and the extended concept of life history recognised that material culture functions in multiple cultural and chronological contexts-within both indigenous and post-contact spheres. 
 Examination of the collecting process led to the identification of five curio collecting paradigms: curio collecting for the acquisition of social status, curio collecting for financial return, curio collecting as an adjunct to natural history collecting, curio collecting as an adjunct to historical recording, and ethnological or culture-area curio collecting. Filtering processes associated with each paradigm resulted in particular, but not always distinctive, patterns of curio selectivity and styles of provenance recording. 
 A switch in the focus of attention from examination of curio collectng processes generally to the study of the filtering processes that shaped collections from a specific archaeological site-the pre-European Otago Peninsula site of Little Papanui (J44/1)- enabled some evaluation of individuual collection representation. A database recording up to 19 attributes for each of 6282 curios localised to &#65533;Little Papanui&#65533; in Otago Museum enabled 31 dedicated or &#65533;ardent&#65533; collectors who operated at the site to be identified. These 31 dedicated collectors were grouped according to the paradigm that best described their collecting behaviour. It was found that the greater proportion of these dedicated collectors (n=12, 39%) had been influenced by the ethnological or culture-area collecting paradigm. These 12 collectors were responsible for recovering a remarkable 5645 curios or nearly ninety-percent (89.86%) of the meta-collection. 
 Because curio collections lack meaningfully recorded stratigraphic provenance, it is the technological and social context in which tools and ornaments functioned that must become the focus of curio collection studies. Appropriate studies of technological and social and context focus upon evaluations of raw material sourcing, evaluations of manufacture technique and assessments of tool and ornament use and reuse (and integrative combinations of these modes of study). These sorts of evaluation require large collections compiled in the least selective manner possible and the collections need to be reliably localised to specific sites. Collections compiled by the ethnological or culture-area collectors have these qualities. Collections compiled within other paradigms lack locality information and were assembled in highly selective manners.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">collectors and collecting</field><field name="subject">historic sites</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.115610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Funding contextual theology in Aotearoa - New Zealand : the theological contribution of James K. Baxter</field><field name="creator">Riddell, Michael</field><field name="description">Aotearoa-New Zealand received Christianity as part of the colonial/missionary matrix of nineteenth century European expansion. Consequently the form and content of faith was largely shaped by factors distant both in geography and symbolic resonance. Christian theology maintains a cultural dissonance, particularly from an emergent Pakeha cultural indentity.
	The quest for contextualisation has become a familiar one in post-colonial societies, though not as vigorously pursued in Western nations as in other parts of the world. Only recently has attention been paid to the possibilities of local theologies in New Zealand.
	C.S. Song&#65533;s suggests &#65533;Perhaps a poet can tell us how we should go about theology&#65533;. In this he is pointing to the necessity of contextual theology using domestic cultural product as an important source for theological reflection, encapsulating as it does local history and experience.
	James K. Baxter, one of New Zealand&#65533;s finest poets, was also a Catholic and social critic. In the last years of his life particularly, the major part of his writing, both poetry and prose, was concerned with his vision of a Christian humanism which might make a practical difference in the immediate context. He established a community at the small settlement of Jerusalem beside the Whanganui River, where he sought to give tangible expression to a mixture of radical Christian acceptance and Maori spiritual values.
	This thesis examines Baxter&#65533;s contribution to the task of contextual theology. In particular, it draws on a great deal of unpublished prose material, until now largely unexamined, from the late period of his life. This, together with the wider body of his writings, is used to investigate his religious thought and movement within it.
	After an introductory and methodological chapter, the thesis examines Baxter&#65533;s categorisation of the fragmented and spiritually bereft nature of Pakeha existence. It then seeks to follow the major themes of his own powerfully articulated responses to this condition, in a series of chapters introduced with Maori terms; a cultural connection which was important to Baxter.
	The investigation uncovers a commitment to a Christian humanism that recognises the immanence of Christ, and a rather startling manifesto which parallels the approach of Liberation Theology in a distinctly New Zealand context. The survey of Baxter&#65533;s religious thought concludes with a critical reflection on his themes.
	A final chapter considers the contribution which Baxter makes toward the challenge of contextual theology. Considering the relationship between poetic reflection and theology, it stops short of classifying Baxter as a theologian. Rather the argument is advanced that he has provided vital raw material to the ongoing task of local theology; his role is one of &#65533;funding&#65533; contextual theology symbolically. Baxter is significant in the development of theology in Aotearoa-New Zealand, both for his contribution and his encouragement to further reflection.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">James K.

The aim of the Kai o te Hauora Training is to empower iwi and Maori communities with the skills, knowledge and resources to enable them to make informed decisions about their nutritional health.
	The research methods were grounded in Kaupapa Maori research methodology. Three community members who have taken part in the Kai o te Hauora training were interviewed as well as those people with whom they have networked within the wider community. Formal unstructured interviews were carried out with a total of twenty-three people over a twenty month period from November 1998 to June 2000. The interviews were each transcribed and analysed for key themes. The results of the interviews documented the changes in behaviour and attitudes toward nutrition for the Maori community in the Whakatane region, through the stories of the three community members who had taken part in the training. Their successes and difficulties in attempting to influence change were also recorded.
	The success of the Kai o te Hauora training in relation to the literature is discussed. The importance of working from a Kaupapa Maori framework in both nutrition interventions and research relating to Maori is emphasised. This framework inherently acknowledges the importance of Maori networks, values and concepts. The importance of the Kai o te Hauora training principle of empowerment is also acknowledged as being fundamental to the programmes success. The need for further research to measure the impact of the Kai o te Hauora programme, and Maori women&#65533;s contributions to their communities is noted, as is the need for this research to have been carried out within a Kaupapa Maori framework.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">kai totika</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.111203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Co-management : a tool for genuine Maori involvement in coastal management</field><field name="creator">Blundell, Ian</field><field name="description">For Maori, the management fo New Zealand&#65533;s coast and its resources is fundamental to their cultural identity. Iwi and hapu throughout New Zealand have close relationships with the coast and unique rights and responsibilities for its future management.

	Co-management initiatives in coastal management, particularly under the Conservation Act 1987, Resource Management Act 1991 and several legislative initiatives controlling fisheries management, are explored and critiqued. Overall, the initiatives demonstrate that progress is being made in coastal management for better protection of Maori coastal values. Nevertheless, there is scope for further improvements concerning greater Maori involvement in coastal management.
	Recommendations for genuine co-management systems in New Zealand&#65533;s coastal management regime include effective communication between iwi and Government; appreciation of the unique nature of each iwi in New Zealand; involvement of a third party communicating between iwi and Government representatives; appropriate funding and resources to maintain the co-management system, and encouragement and motivation from the Government to initiate and maintain the co-management system.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaitiakitanga</field><field name="subject">coastal zone management</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.114028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape : perceptions of Kai Tahu I Mua, Aianei, A Muri Ake</field><field name="creator">Russell, Khyla J</field><field name="description">This research is concerned with Kai Tahu experiences and understandings of the concept and use of the term, landscape.

All responses are used to illustrate the ways in which Kai Tahu and some of their non-Kai Tahu spouses express particular definitions of what for each, constitutes and is constituted in the landscape.
	Kai Tahu participants&#65533; landscape definition includes whakapapa, placenames, identity (personal and cultural), spirituality and sustenance. Elements of these are present to a similar degree for some of the spouses, but not all. This seems largely dependent upon the degree to which they have participated in matters pertaining to Kai Tahu. Degrees of participation and connection may be applied to Tahu people alienated from their kaik, whether urbanised near or distantly domiciled.
	Theoretical bases in literature from a number of disciplines are used to discuss perceptions of what anthropologists more usually term &#65533;place&#65533; and how Kai Tahu fit this or choose to fit the understanding of cultural others into our world view. The research also looks briefly at the environmental landscape and who presently has power and therefore mana over its use and or misuse, especially in relation to management of Papatuanuku.
	Due to the [sic] of the type [sic] project this thesis is, it cannot finally conclude there is a single Kai Tahu or gender specific perception of landscape. This would never be provable in any circumstance, since it is not scientifically based. It does however, suggest there is an indigenous perspective of landscape that differs from certain Western thinking and within the indigenous perspective, a Kai Tahu epistemological understanding of the landscape based on our theory and knowledge of ourselves.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.151703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia uruuru mai a hauora : being healthy, being Maori: conceptualising Maori health promotion.</field><field name="creator">Ratima, M. M (Mihi M.)</field><field name="description">The Decade of Maori Development (1984-1994) stimulated the re-emergence of distinctly Maori approaches to progressing their own advancement. Maori health promotion is one such approach that has a central concern for improving Maori health outcomes. A range of Maori collectives are providing what they claim to be distinctly Maori health promotion initiatives. However, Maori health promotion has a pragmatic orientation, and this has, at least in part, led to conceptual and theoretical under-development. There is an almost complete lack of empirically and theoretically sound work to conceptualise Maori health promotion. This research programme has focused on identifying the defining characteristics of Maori health promotion.
	The primary data source for this research programme was three case studies of Maori health promotion interventions.
	Tipu Ora - a Maori community-based well-child programme;
	the Plunket Kaiawhina Service - a national Maori focussed initiative located within a mainstream service; and,
	the Wairarapa Maori Asthma Project - a tribally-based asthma management initiative.
	The main source of data in each of the case studies was in-depth open-ended interviews with programme participants and stakeholders. Data was also drawn from document review and archival records.
	The findings of this research indicate that Maori health promotion is based on a broad concept of health, which can be expanded as the basis for a more general argument for Maori advancement. Maori health promotion is the process of enabling Maori to increase control over the determinants of health and strengthen their identity as Maori, and thereby improve their health and position in society. Its defining characteristics have been identified in this research programme, and presented in &#65533;Kia uruuru mai a hauora&#65533;, a framework for Maori health promotion. The Framework has the potential to provide the basis for a more consistent and rigorous approach to Maori health promotion practice, policy, purchasing, and research. Aspects of the Framework may also have wider application to generic health promotion and other indigenous peoples&#65533; approaches to health promotion.
	This study concludes that Maori health promotion draws primarily on the heritage and new knowledge that arises from Maori and Western experiences. However, it remains grounded in the distinctive concepts and values of Maori worldviews. Maori health promotion is a distinctly Maori process, in step with and indigenous health promotion, but primarily on the determination of Maori to be Maori.</field><field name="date">2001,</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.152546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytochrome P450 activity and pollutant exposure in New Zealand native birds</field><field name="creator">Numata, Mihoko</field><field name="description">Birds are potentially vulnerable to the toxicity of certain environmental pollutants due to limited detoxification capabilities of their liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. In wild birds, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (EROD) activity, a marker of CYP1A activity in mammals and domestic chickens, has been used as a biomarker of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatic CYP activity as an indication of detoxification capacity in New Zealand birds. In addition to the use of conventional in vitro CYP activity assays, the applicability of a noninvasive CYP activity assay was tested using caffeine as the in vivo substrate. 
 The ontogeny of liver microsomal 3-hydroxylation of quinine, a marker of human CYP3A activity, was investigated in Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Ross Island, Antarctica. The results indicate that chicks (2-4 weeks old) possess a CYP3A-like isoform(s) as active as but not identical to the CYP3A-like isoform(s) in adults. Total CYP content was low at 2 weeks of age and increased rapidly and linearly approaching adult levels by 4 weeks of age implying a rapid development of CYPs other than the CYP3A-like isoform(s). 
 The main study was conducted on adult (and some post-fledging immature) birds of two native species, the herbivorous paradise shelduck (Tadorna variegata) and the omnivorous southern black-backed gull (Larus dominicanus). Birds were shot for liver collection at three sites in the South Island of New Zealand; West Coast, Lake Waipori and Dunedin landfill, in 2001-2002. The results indicate that shelducks posssess multiple CYP isoforms that independently catalyse EROD, p-nitrophenol hydroxylation (p-NP) and erythromycin demethylation (EMD), markers of mammalian CYP1A, CYP2E and CYP3A activity, respectively. In contrast, gulls appear to possess a single isoform catalysing both EROD and p-NP but possess no isoform capable of catalysing EMD. 
 EROD activity was high in shelducks and gulls from the landfill site, although it was not significantly associated with liver concentrations of PCBs (0.079-6.2 and 8.2-310 ng/g in shelducks and gulls, respectively), PCDD/PCDFs, toxic equivalents (TEQs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (0.85-317 and 44-4800 ng/g in shelducks and gulls, respectively) in either species. In shelduck livers from the landfill site, EROD was positively associated with Pb concentration but negatively associated with Hg concentration. Assessment of PCB congener patterns based on concentration ratios of individual congeners to the reference congener, 2,2&#65533;,4,4&#65533;,5,5&#65533;-hexachlorobiphenyl (IUPAC #153), indicate that the metabolism of 2,4,4&#65533;-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB#28) and 2,4,4&#65533;,5-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB#74) is inducible in shelducks but not in gulls. Hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) content was higher in gulls than in shelducks suggesting greater resistance to oxidative stress in gulls. 
 The in vivo caffeine metabolism test as a noninvasive method to determine CYP1A activity in shelducks and gulls gave a positive outcome. The test was performed by administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of caffeine (1 mg/kg body weight) followed by blood collection at 2 and 4 h after caffeine administration for determination of the serum concentration ratio of the metabolite, paraxanthine, to caffeine (PX/CA) by HPLC. In both species, the PX/CA ratio was markedly increased by pretreatment with the model CYP1A inducer, &#946;-naphthoflavone (BNF). BNF treatment also increased EROD activity determined after death (80-fold and 20-fold compared to controls in shelducks and gulls, respectively). However, sensitivity of the PX/CA ratio approach was lower in gulls than in shelducks due presumably to the formation of unidentified caffeine metabolites in gulls. Immunoblot analysis failed to reveal increased CYP protein levels caused by BNF treatment in shelducks and gulls due to poor cross-reactivity of avian proteins with polyclonal antibodies raised against mammalian CYPs. 
 EROD activity was also determined in livers of the piscivorous yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) (1 chick, 3 post-fledging immature, 1 adult) from Otago, South Island of New Zealand, and found to be below the limit of quantitation. The adult liver contained 18.5 ng/g of total PCBs suggesting that EROD in this species is insensitive to induction. Comparison of the PCB congener pattern based on [PCBx]/[PCB#153] between the penguin and its putative source of PCB exposure, New Zealand marine fish, indicates that CYPs in yellow-eyed penguins metabolise 2,2&#65533;,5,5&#65533;-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB#52) and 2,2&#65533;,4,5,5&#65533;-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB#101) as in many other avian species. 
 The findings of this study highlight substantial species differences in CYP activity in wild birds. Whether CYP expression in New Zealand birds is genetically distinct from birds in other parts of the world may warrant further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">birds</field><field name="subject">effect of pollution</field><field name="subject">environmental toxicology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.141101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Waka! Life histories of two contemporary Polynesian voyaging canoes</field><field name="creator">Kottmann, Ilka</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the life-histories of the two contemporary Polynesian vovaging canoes from Aotearoa New Zealand. It documents the background, construction and voyages of Hawaiki Nui (1979 - 1986) built by Matahi Whakataka-Brightwell and Te Aurere (1992 - 1998) built by Hekenukumai Puhipi Busby. It also highlights the historical and cultural significance of waka for Maori and other indigenous Pacific peoples.
	Based on my field work as a participant in Maori voyaging between 1996 and 1998, I argue that this revival of waka voyaging reaffirms the cultural identities of contemporary Maori and other Polynesians. The case studies of Hawaiki Nui and Te Aurere confirm the ongoing significance of waka not only in Aotearoa New Zealand, but Pacific-wide. Contemporary Polynesian waka voyaging is historically significant as it revives unique Polynesian skills, such as traditional waka-building, navigation and sailing techniques. It is also culturally significant, as it reinforces central Maori (and Polynesian) cultural concepts, such as whakapapa (genealogy ties) and whanaungatanga (sense of belonging).
	At a time when Maori(as well as other indigenous Pacific peoples) are constantly negotiating and redefining their cultural boundaries within their respective socio-political contexts, Polynesian voyaging waka are reappearing as a strong symbol of Pacific Islanders&#65533; cultural identities. As a symbol of a shared seafaring past they create timeless platforms for Maori and other Polynesians to negotiate the boundaries of their cultures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">waka</field><field name="subject">canoes and canoeing</field><field name="subject">Polynesian navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070517.130329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Te Tahi o Pipiri" : Literacy and missionary pedagogy as mechanisms in change. The reactions of three rangatira from the Bay of Islands: 1814-1834</field><field name="creator">Tuato'o, Danny</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the ways Imperialism (and consequently colonialism) has pervaded the indigenous &#65533;primitive&#65533; world. Protectorates and &#65533;the colonies&#65533; reflected imperialist ideals, expansion, territory, external revenue and power. Missionaries were the footmen of colonial policy. The relations forged between these evangelists and the indigene have been thoroughly studied and scrutinised. However, reported interaction has been about missionaries and the &#65533;native&#65533;, with less about that between the indigenes, individual and tribe, elder and young. The thesis intends to redress this imbalance in the Bay of Islands from 1814 to 1834.
	The following work is an examination of a process of social change in Aotearoa. In the early 19th century the physical, spiritual and intellectual contact made between Maori peoples and the European explorers, scientists, and missionaries involved a deliberate cultural entanglement. It is the processes of acculturation, assimilation, or simply misunderstanding that are of interest. The study will have several foci involving the reaction of peoples of the Bay of Islands to the missionary institution of religious education. Chapter One addresses the theoretical location of the peoples that interacted in the Bay, while the second chapter is a brief description of a Maori coastal society prior to the arrival of literate missionaries. Chapter Three is about the cultural and social engagements of Ruatara, Marsden, Kendall and Hongi. The final chapter is a biographical exploration in the life of Rawiri Tawhanga and his interactions with missionaries and Maori of the Bay. Fundamentally it is the indigenous interaction during the initial periods of external European contact and, therefore, the effects of internal societal change that the author wishes to examine.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Bay of Islands</field><field name="subject">missionaries</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.144700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of bicultural initiatives performed in tertiary departments of psychology in Aotearoa</field><field name="creator">Skipper, Rueben Ngariki</field><field name="description">In the past psychology has been criticised for its mono-cultural nature and insensitivity when dealing with Maori clients and students. As a consequence university departments of psychology have sought to address these issues by incorporating the ideology of biculturalism into its operations. The aim of the study was to evaluate the bicultural developments occurring within these departments by assessing the type and effectiveness of bicultural initiatives. A questionnaire designed to assess bicultural initiatives, attitudes and, intentions was sent to academic staff within university psychology departments in New Zealand. Northern departments displayed significantly greater commitment to bicultural progress than southern departments with northern academics performing initiatives (e.g., &#65533;established a committee of staff and students to promote bicultural perspectives and interpret and apply bicultural policy&#65533;) more often and of higher commitment than southern academics. Overall, within psychology departments very little bicultural progress has occurred except in the most northern departments. However, the effectiveness of many initiatives is debateable with tokenistic initiativeness predominant in most departments. The qualitative analysis of participant comments identified academic justification for bicultural inaction within departments. This was displayed in various themes: multiculturalism versus biculuralism, psychology being an a cultural science, Maori self-determination being separatism akin to apartheid, the relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi to psychology, and Backlash. Two main reasons for these findings are discussed; (1) lack of knowledge of Maori issues and, (2) racism.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biculturalism</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">universities and colleges</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.145218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberalism, communitarianism, fairness and social policy</field><field name="creator">Gasson, Ruth</field><field name="description">Communitarianism is an internationally contentious anti-liberal theory which is becoming increasingly popular in political philosophy. It commonly is employed to motivate and legitimate &#65533;identity politics&#65533; - a politics which is used to defend the rights of disadvantaged aboriginal minorities to maintain their traditional ways.
	Recently &#65533;identity politics&#65533; has been exploited in mainstream poltical/educational academic literature in New Zealand, especially in literature that deals with Maori issues. This is significant because in the recent history of New Zealand, liberal political theory has been dominant.
	Notions of rights and of fairness are fundamental to communitarianism and to liberalism, but communitarians and liberals hold very different ideas about what these notions involve. My PhD thesis compares their ideas and relates them to New Zealand. It views certain social and political issues in New Zealand, by way of liberal and then communitarian theories. It examines how liberalism and communitarianism have been, and can be, used to support and to legitimate particular policies and practices in terms of &#65533;fairness&#65533; and &#65533;justice&#65533;.
	My work considers the explanatory and the practical application of communitarianism and liberalism with respect to their conceptions of human nature, political ideals, rights and rationality. It defends liberalism against the communities the protections they &#65533;need&#65533; in order to flourish. With respect to New Zealand it recognises that Maori have been treated unjustly by the crown, but argues that much of the injustice happened, not because of liberalism, but because liberal values were not upheld.
	The thesis concludes that liberalism is better equipped than communitarianism to describe Maori and Pakeha relations, and to formulate a framework for positive and constructive trans-cultural policies that will respect both Maori and Pakeha cultures.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="subject">social policy</field><field name="subject">justice</field><field name="subject">fairness</field><field name="subject">communitarianism</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.122329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power relationships and community law centres in Dunedin : power relationships between community organisations, their communities and their funding bodies : specifically focusing on community law centres in Dunedin and the Legal Services Board</field><field name="creator">Walker, Peter E</field><field name="description">This research engages critically with major public sector accountability theories in relation to the development of law centres in Aotearoa/New Zealand (and comparative international examples) focusing on the two centres in Otago, the Ngai Tahu Maori Law Centre and the Dunedin Community Law Centre.
	Definitions of accountability are argued to be embedded within theoretical discourses which produce definable models of accountability corresponding to these theoretical statements. Case studies of the discourses of both law centres and their funding bodies are described and contrasted in terms of their views of the role of law centres, interaction with various interest groups and their accountability relationships. The data identifies a desire of both community law centres to engage with a communitarian, &#65533;bottom-up&#65533;, model of accountability, in contrast to the former social democratic-bureaucratic and current liberal &#65533;stakeholder&#65533; and &#65533;contract&#65533; models of the official funding agencies. The current dominance of the liberal &#65533;stakeholder&#65533; discourse is seen as based on professional power, hierarchical legal structure and control of funding. It is argued that any shift in the dominance of power relationships surrounding community law centres in Aotearoa/New Zealand would entail a strengthening of ties and links with the community, through seeking alternative power supports, a participatory structure and locally controlled funding.

The shift in these ideals, which have underpinned literacy instruction in the New Zealand primary school curriculum, is traced from the establishment of a &#65533;high-culture&#65533; British imperially-based notion of culture in the late 1920s to its replacement with a technocratic approach to literacy instruction in the revisions to primary school curriculum policy in the mid-1950s. This rise of a technocratic approach to literacy instruction resulted from what Frank Fischer has called a &#65533;quiet revolution&#65533;, where complex interactions between educational administrators, teacher unions, politicians, influential teachers, teacher educators, and politics in the administrative hierarchies and policies which governed the New Zealand primary school.
	This study provides an alternative vision of the history of the development of the New Zealand primary school curriculum. Previous New Zealand curriculum historians have portrayed the development of the primary school curriculum as a progressive evolution from the &#65533;old&#65533; methods of the early decades of mass education to the &#65533;modern&#65533; methods of the 1940s and 1950s. In contrast to the traditional view of the development of the New Zealand curriculum, this historical account of the development of literacy instruction in New Zealand focuses upon the political, cultural, and ideological processes that underpinned curriculum policy and practice during the period under investigation.
	By the mid-1950s, the overt ideals of English cultural imperialism had been exchanged for &#65533;scientific efficiency&#65533;. In this, &#65533;value-free&#65533; methods continued to embody dominant cultural beliefs under the supposedly neutral approaches of a technocratic approach to literacy. It is argued that the dominance of the cultural-heritage model of literacy instruction, with its elitist version of English language and culture, promoted a British-based &#65533;high-culture&#65533; tradition in the literacy curriculum. When the supposedly &#65533;value-neutral&#65533; methodologies were applied to literacy instruction in the early 1950s, these values survived as this technocratic approach to reading disengaged literacy instruction from the wider cultural, political, and social context.
	In recent years, the debates over reading techniques have once again surfaced in the public and academic press. These debates need to acknowledge this historical context and work towards a more balanced vision of literacy instruction, where literacy is not merely defined as the reading of the word. Current debates over reading techniques, curriculum policy, and literacy instruction practices need to view literacy as a complex process which is linked to a wider political and cultural world.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">reading</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.125057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Resource Management Act 1991 and Nga Iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Ruru, Tania Suzanne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the sections in the Resource Management Act 1991 of particular relevance for nga Iwi Maori and assesses how well these facilitate involvement for Maori in the management of New Zealand&#65533;s resources. The method of assessment used is one of comparison between the schemes and philosophies of 1991 Act, and the active involvement of Maori in decision-making for their resources which is requires by Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi).
	Part i describes the Maori world view of the environment and outlines the Treaty of Waitangi and its relevance to resource management law.
	Part ii describes the purpose and principles contained in sections 5, 6(e), 7(a), and 8 of the 1991 Act. Chapter Three provides an overview of the relationship between the purpose and principles. Chapter Four discusses the purpose in section 5 and proclaims that the inclusion of sustainability as a purpose in resource management legislation is advantageous in terms of the indirect furtherance of Maori conservation aspirations for the enviroment. It also describes how the cultural wellbeing of Maori has been interpreted to be an express part of the purpose of the Act. Chapter Five provides an analysis of section 6(e) which makes the relationship of Maori and their culture and traditions with their taonga a matter of national importance under the Act. Chapter Six describes section 7(a) and kaitiakitanga which must be given particular regard under the Act. Chapter Seven discusses section 8 and the content and meaning of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Part ii concludes that while the facilitation of Maori involvement in the management and protection of natural and physical resources is improved under this Act, these sections are an insufficient safeguard for Maori interests.
	Part iii assesses the other sections in the Act which have a bearing on Maori involvement in resource management processes. Chapter Eight explores the planning system. Chapter Nine describes the resource consent processes in the 1991 Act. Chapter Ten comments on various procedural provisions which introduce tikanga Maori into the Act, and Chapter Eleven is devoted to exploring the sections in the Act which in the writer&#65533;s opinion provide the most potential for recognition of rangatiratanga in a limited form. This Part proclaims that the emphasis in the Act is very much on consultation with nga Iwi Maori as an effective means for their involement in resource management. It is submitted that this is not the active participation in decision-making that Maori seek and which is guaranteed under Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi.
	Chapter Twelve acknowledges that involvement of nga Iwi Maori in processes under the 1991 Act will rely to some extent on the content of policy statements and plans produced by the local authorities. An analysis of the Proposed Otago Regional Policy Statement is undertaken to explore how the concerns of Kai Tahu have been incorporated into the statement.
	Chapter Thirteen ends by concluding that while the 1991 Act does provide for increased Maori involvement in resource management processes in New Zealand it does not facilitate the decision-making role guaranteed by Article ii of the Treaty of Waitangi.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Resource Management Act</field><field name="subject">environmental law</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">conservation of natural resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.141814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori Whare after contact</field><field name="creator">Martin, David Robert</field><field name="description">This study explores post-contact changes to the ordinary Maori whare. The main physical characteristics of the ordinary whare at contact are identified by accessing archaeological and written 18th century ethnographic data. Changes in the ordinary whare in the period from contact to 1940 are discussed. Evidence from historical archaeology, written 19th century ethnographic accounts and from previous academic research is considered. In addition, changes in the ordinary whare are highlighted, based on evidence from an empirical survey of whare depicted in sketches, paintings, engravings and photographs. Rigorous statistical analysis was beyound the scope of a Master&#65533;s thesis, however trends in the data are presented. A range of these are reproduced illustrating the text. After changing gradually for 130 years, the ordinary Maori whare appears to have been widely replaced by European-style houses in the early decades of the 20th century.
	In Aotearoa/New Zealand in the 1990s, it is apparent that Maori culture has survived the 220 or so years since contact. These years entailed increasing contact between Maori and European. In mid 20th century academic studies of Maori communities, European-style houses were found to have been used in line with continuing Maori conceptions. This evidence indicates that traditional ideas were transferred to European-style houses. The gradual changes in the whare prior to the 20th century indicate that it was a conservative social construction of space conforming to expectations about vernacular architecture generally. But the process by which Maori culture was maintained and reproduced was complicated that further study of Maori conceptions of space within the home is required.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">dwellings</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.145017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contradictions in culture : 8 case studies of Maori identity</field><field name="creator">Bellett, Donella Frances</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the phenomenon known as a Maori ethnic identity.

Integral to all identities, however, was the use of both cultural and biological factors. In constructing and maintaining their identities as Maori my informants looked firstly to the presence of ancestry and, following from this cultural practices were employed. The use of ancestry as a basis of identity, and the causal attributes associated with it (such as natural leanings towards the use of Maori language), represent essentialist tendencies on the part of many of my informants.

Analysis is performed using institutional theory and methodology.
	A broad review of institutional theory is made. In contrast to neoclassical economic theory, of which institutionalists have been a major voice of dissent, institutionalism stresses a holistic approach to policy analysis. An understanding of the the forces for institutional change and the structure of that change are the primary focus of institutionalism.
	An institutional framework for understanding the common pool nature of fishery resources is adopted. This highlights how the physical and technical characteristics of the resource and related decision-making arrangements influence the patterns of human interaction that determine the outcomes of a management regime such as the QMS.
	It is shown that the QMS was adopted in 1986 to address the biological crisis that had occurred because of past open access management policies. The fiscal crisis and the economic ideology prevailing at the time were also influential in promoting the QMS. The system was not able to be expanded as was intended because of a series of challenges from Maori disputing the Crown&#65533;s right to fishery resources. The Deed of Settlement signed in 1992, has supposedly settled Maori claims to commercial fisheries and allowed expansion of the QMS.
	Assessing the QMS using the institutional framework developed, showed the strong influence that neoclassical ideology has played in determining the outcomes achieved. Inadequate information concerning biophysical, social and economic implications of fishing constrain the ability of the QMS to successfully manage the resource. Inconsistencies and inadequacies in the legislation are only just being addressed as part of a comprehensive legislative review process.
	The future development of the QMS is also addressed in terms of the likelihood of cooperative common property management regimes being adopted. The common pool nature of the fisheries makes common property management regimes preferable. Cooperative community cultures are claimed by institutionalists to improve the outcomes achieved in common property regimes. There was considered, however, to be only limited potential for cooperation within the current institutional structure for New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries. Although the changes of the legislative review appear to be making some progressive changes, the diversity of interest groups and the prevailing western culture are seen as potential impediments to a comprehensive cooperative regime.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">quota system</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">institutional economics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.130233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;This must be the place&#65533; : plumbing a land ethic for the built environment</field><field name="creator">Ballantyne, Brian Andrew</field><field name="description">A land ethic within the built enviroment was examined from the perspective of the surveying community in New Zealand. The research followed a structure of context, interpretation and application; used legal analysis; and, sampled the ideologies of iwi liason officers, consultant surveyors, and local authorities.
	Context involved asking why a land ethic was being debated, by focusing on the current level of environmental thought, and on the actions of the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG) and the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors (NZIS). Some findings are: that terms such as sustainable management and nature are ambiguous cultural constructs; and, that the adoptation of an environmental policy by the NZIS continues to be a tortuous process.
	Interpretation involved asking what constituted a New Zealand ethic, by putting such an ethic into perspective in relation to ecophilosophy, and by searching for a contemporary sense of kaitiakitanga. Some findings are: that restraint and humility are requirements in any moral theory of nature; that kaitiakitanga is not dependent on title to land; and, that iwi liason officers are divided as to how kaitiakitanga applied to the built environment.
	Application involved suggesting how a land ethic could be invoked in the built environment, through the provision of green space in the form of local purpose reserves. Some findings are: that surveyors regard reserves as being significantly less vital to a community&#65533;s well-being than engineered services; and, that local authorities are not generally aware that reserve policies might have to be linked to municipal open space strategies.
	The broad conclusions are: that regardless of the environment that now exists, surveyors will be required to make moral choices about the environment that is sought; that a land ethic will not necessarily provide rational prescriptions directing action towards land; and, that there is inherent tension between land tenure, land use and a land ethic. Suggested avenues for further research include a comparative analysis of other landed professions; the empowerment of women within any land ethic; and, the use of content analysis as an alternative methodology.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">environmental protection</field><field name="subject">surveying</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">cosmology</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.140040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Kaati Mamoe hapuu of Mahitahi : a question of mana?</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Emma</field><field name="description">Kaumaatua of the Te Koeti Turanga hapuu (sub-tribe) of South Westland have expressed concern that the mana of their Kaati Mamoe ancestors has been trampled on and their identity subsumed through union with the Kai Tahu tribal confederation. The history of the Kaati Mamoe iwi in the South island has been marginalised by the subsequent arrival of a number of hapuu of the Ngaati Kahungunu in the seventeenth century. The conflict which ensured following this gradual migration has traditionally been interpreted as marking the end of a Kaati Mamoe identity in the island. Complexity has been added to this situation as a result of European colonisation in the nineteenth century. The purchase by Pakeha of vast tracts of land in the South Island, and the failure to exempt the reserves promised, put pressure on the takata whenua&#65533;s land base and resources. The Crown&#65533;s refusal to acknowledge and redress the grievances of South Island Maori over the last hundred years has obliged the Kaati Mamoe to unite with the Kai Tahu. This process has served to further marginalise their identity, in this case in the southern rohe of the West Coast.
	The method that I have used in this work draws upon a number of disciplines. Oral history and written records of the Te Koeti hapuu form the central sources and to this extent this work may be described as being written from a Kaati Mamoe perspective. I have undertaken a review of the material recorded by European collectors of South Island Maori tradition in order to understand the way in which their reports have shaped the European view of South Westland Maori. And finally a review of the archaeological record has been included in order to provide information about the everyday material life of the ancestors of the South Westland hapuu.
	A number of conclusions have been reached in this thesis. Firstly that the peace arrangement at Popoutunoa which has been viewed by Kai Tahu as marking the end of a Kaati Mamoe identity is not necessarily the view of many Kaati Mamoe descendants. The historical record shows that a number of individuals continued to fight the Kai Tahu due to tribal differences while others continued to live alongside Kai Tahu in peace. As throughout much of Aotearoa, the importance of the hapuu as a source for an individual&#65533;s identity in Maori society prior to European colonisation has been over-shadowed. In the case of the South Westland people union with Kai Tahu, which was vital in the face of the loss of land, has been interpreted as the loss of their affiliation and identity with Kaati Mamoe.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kati Mamoe</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.100136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cervical cancer in Maori women</field><field name="creator">Ratima, Keri</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with cervical cancer amongst New Zealand women, particularly Maori women. Maori women have an alarmingly high incidence of cervical cancer, approximately three times higher than non-Maori women. Maori women experience one of the highest rates of cervical cancer in the world.
	Chapter one, two and three form the introductory section of the thesis, Section A. Chapter one provides an overview of cervical cancer incidence in the world, followed by a more detailed analysis of the occurrence of cervical cancer in New Zealand and a discussion of the aetiological factors of cervical cancer. Cervical screening is discussed in Chapter two. The ethnic differences in incidence and mortality of cervical cancer between Maori and non-Maori and possible reasons for these differences are studied in Chapter three.
	Section B consists of the original work undertaken. A pilot study (Chapter four) was conducted to trial the methods for the national study (Chapter five). The national study was a retrospective review of the cervical smear histories of Maori women first diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer over a recent two year period in order to investigate why Maori women have not had their disease detected by screening and treated at the intraepithelial stage. Maori women&#65533;s knowledge of and attitudes towards cervical screening were obtained in a survey in Ruatoria (Chapter six).

Increasingly, writers from the indigenous race in these former colonies have felt moved to respond to these tensions in their imaginative fiction. This study has undertaken a comparative cross-cultural analysis of the works of two writers from such societies whose indigenous cultures share common assumptions, to explore the underlying impetus of these tensions, and the writers&#65533; proposals for resolving them.
	Chapter One assesses Witi Ihimaera as a writer, and explores his concept of biculturalism, with particular emphasis on the distinctly Maori point of view which informs his analysis of contemporary social problems.
	Chapter Two assays Ihimaera&#65533;s pastoral writings, Pounamu Pounamu, Tangi, and Whanau, tracing in them the development of his concept of biculturalism, and also the changes in Ihimaera&#65533;s writing that culminated in The new Net Goes Fishing, with the hardening of attitude that it expresses.
	Chapter Three looks at the revisionism of Ihimaera&#65533;s view of New Zealand history from a Maori viewpoint. It uses Ihimaera&#65533;s The Matriarch not only as a means of exploring this revisionist Maori perspective, but also as evidence of the radicalisation of Ihimaera&#65533;s views, and the broadening of the concept of biculturalism to embrace not only cultural, but social and political matters.
	Chapter Four considers Ihimaera&#65533;s The Whale Rider as a feminist restatement of earlier views and highlights the growing dilemma he faces concerning the concept of biculturalism.
	Chapter Five focuses on Achebe, the writer, and his view of the role of the African writer in contemporary society. It argues that Achebe views himself as a seer, a visionary writer who has the answer that could regenerate his society.
	Chapter Six analyses Achebe&#65533;s Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God, and argues that contrary to accepted views of Okonkwo, this character is not actually representative of his society but a deviant. It further argues that the post-colonial African societies&#65533; affictions with irresponsible leaders were already manifest in the colonial period, through characters such as Okonkwo and Ezeulu, whom Achebe sees as guilty of gross abuses of power and privilege.
	Chapter Seven looks at both No Longer at Ease and A Man of the People, and argues that the failure of the first indigenous administrative class stems both from their having an incomplete apprehension of all the aspects of their heritage and the responsibility which power imposes on those who exercise it, and also from lack of restraint in wielding of power. It further argues that the unbridled scramble for materialism has resulted in the destruction of democratic principles.
	In the context of contemporary New Zealand society, Ihimaera sees the solution for Maori post-colonial tensions as bicultural integration, but he is having problems with the concept in the face of increasing radical activism from Maoris who see it as little better than assimilation. Achebe, however, has opted for re-formism, having discarded traditionalism because it is inadequate for people in the modern world.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.113620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori schools of New Zealand, 1930-1945 : a critical examination of the policies which lead [i.e., led] to their renewal</field><field name="creator">McKean, John Charles</field><field name="description">The chief argument of this study of major reforms within Maori schools is that while their curriculum was updated and morale restored, all educational developments were predicated upon the Maori people remaining a rural, dependent people.
	In the background to schooling changes were two expressions of nationalism within New Zealand: Attempts of the Dominion, at an official level, to assert its independence, moves made more urgent by the Depression, and secondly, the growing sense of the Maori people of their racial and cultural heritage. These significant changes were joined by a clutch of moves which propelled the Maori people into the national economy.
	The chief architects of schooling changes would have considered their work made a major break with the past. In reality it continued a tradition embedded in the nineteenth century in which education was regarded as a means of social control. As such, this paternalistic stance originated from British colonial theory, and from the purposes defined for education of the so-called lower classes. Partial reinterpretations of the tradition emerged in the growing practice of setting aside reserves for native education, from E G Wakefield&#65533;s theories, and the highly influential stance of John Thornton, Headmaster of Te Aute Collage. In a theory novel for the nineteenth century, Thornton held that Maoris should be so educated that they might fill any job or profession.
	Douglas Ball, appointed Inspector in 1928, was a domineering presence within Maori Schools. The substantial support of unique, creative government projects to make productive farms of Maori traditional lands were joined to Ball&#65533;s promotion of the tenets of Progrssive Education, and the then-novel introduction of Maoritanga in the curricululum. Education and social philosophies so espoused were derivative; the former from the &#65533;child-centredness&#65533; of Progressive Education, the latter, from the late colonial theory of adaptionism.
	Schooling renewal and land development attracted bi-partisan support. Ball received further support from international colleagues. It was the demise of the Proficiency Examinaton, however, that enabled education to be pressed into a vocational pattern, and with it, moves to link school and community.
	This renewal received limited challenge until officials pressed for reforms and expansion of secondary education on a vocational basis. Pressure on Denominational Schools to virtually abandon academic courses was exceedingly unpopular, as were the turns the development of the Native District High Schools took: Maori families had become aware that a good life on the land was not possible for all. They also felt the vocational slant was an insult to Maori aspiration for better jobs and recognized status within New Zealand. Maori opposition to this form of education was an appropriate response to its limitations. This study concludes, however, given the paucity of articulate critics a no-contest situation emerged in face of strongly-held stereotypes and the bureaucratic vigour of an Education Department bent on implementing &#65533;progressive&#65533; policies.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">schools</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.120057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seasonality in prehistoric Murihiku : the evidence from oxygen isotope ratios</field><field name="creator">Till, Michael</field><field name="description">Assessing the timing of seasonal movements by the prehistoric peoples of Otago has long been a problem in the archaeology of this region.

Chapter 1. Cultural continuity and the archaeologist's use of ethnographic analogy.

There can be no doubt of the usefulness to New Zealand archaeologists of the confident knowledge that only Polynesians occupied this country, and that they did so for only a comparatively short time. While arguments for Melanesian or Western Polynesian cultural influence, or even a three or four thousand year time span may be noted, the widely held view of cultural continuity and a date for initial settlement perhaps a little more than a thousand years ago, is of crucial importance to the way archaeologists in this country view their primary information. This thesis explores the implications of the &#65533;confidence in the continuity of culture&#65533; by employing the &#65533;direct historical&#65533; ethnographic analogy.
	In addition, this work is also concerned with the &#65533;general comparative&#65533; ethnographic analogy. The difference between the terms &#65533;direct historical&#65533; and &#65533;general comparative&#65533; is significant not only for the variety of methods employed, but also because of the distinctiveness of their limitations. The &#65533;direct historical&#65533; analogy can be used only when there is demonstrable or assumed direct cultural continuity between archaeological information - the prehistoric group - and the ethnographic analogue. &#65533;General comparative&#65533; analogy draws upon a wide variety of cultural and behavioural models to generate hypotheses and interpretations of value to the archaeologist. Ascher (1961) restricts his &#65533;new analogy&#65533; to those archaeological areas for which historical continuity to the ethnographic present cannot be demonstrated. It is clear, however, that the concept of the general comparative analogy is more useful: it is frequently valuable to draw on a wide range of ethnographic observations and generalisations to reinforce particular historical analogues, and to offer interpretations for archaeological data for which there is no direct ethnographic insight.
	The problems of ethnographic analogy have recently come under some scrutiny. This examination involves what is perhaps the central methodological and theoretical issue for archaeology: the relation of excavated data to whatever model or framework is used in interpretation. A major result of this new look at the ethnographic analogy is the recognition that ethnographic observations do not provide the only source of interpretative hypotheses. A more eclectic approach is now favoured and ecology and the behavioural sciences are explored for insight into archaeological data, while systems theory and other frameworks are used in analysis. For example, Anderson (1973) uses a competition model developed by ecologists to explain changes in size frequency and species composition in four stratified midden sites. Clearly the notion that archaeology depends on ethnographic analogy for interpretation is no longer tenable. None the less, ethnographic analogy does remain the most important single source of interpretative models for archaeology...</field><field name="date">1974</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">dwellings</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070620.132352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori problem, 1852-1863</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Allison L.</field><field name="description">That a Maori problem existed in the North Island in the 1850&#65533;s and 1860&#65533;s, the inhabitants, both Maori and Pakeha agreed, but beyond that point there was very little agreement. What was the nature of the problem? Definitions were conflicting. Most Maoris saw the problem as one of survival, political and cultural, in their encounter with a foreign civilization determined upon their subjugation. They looked to the King Movement to prevent the European takeover which they apprehended would destroy their, independence and way of life.
	To the average colonist, on the other hand, the problem represented the Maoris themselves: their very existence in the country which he had come to settle; their claimed ownership of the land which he wanted to farm; their inconvenient (to him) system of land tenure, which rendered purchase difficult; their ignorance and disregard of the laws and customs which governed his society. The solution, in his view, was to detribalize the Maoris, make them obedient to his rule, and individualize or partition their communally owned land in order to facilitate his gaining possession of it. He desired colonial control of native affairs so that such a policy might be put into effect, but was unwilling to assume full responsibility lest Britain should leave the colony to bear the entire burden of its own defence against the potentially hostile tribes.
	The Ministers of the Imperial Government were concerned with yet other aspects of the same problem - observing the Treaty of Waitangi and protecting the Queen&#65533;s Maori subjects from injustice without obstructing the progress of colonization; keeping the peace between two cultural groups whose interests were often antagonistic; upholding British law and sovereignty. A difficult enough task, but one rendered still more difficult by the growing reluctance of the British taxpayer to foot the bill.
	Finally, the Governor, the man who had to find some way to resolve these conflicting aims and desires, faced his own particular dilemmas. How much responsibility should he accept for native affairs? How much control should he allow the Colonial Ministry to arrogate to itself. What interpretation should he place on the Treaty of Waitangi with respect to the rights of chiefs and the sovereignty of the Queen? By what means could he "civilize" the Maoris and bring about their assimilation into colonial society? Should he impose or persuade, legislate, educate, or conquer by force of arms? How was he to obtain the finance and power necessary to carry out any policy successfully?
	This thesis is an attempt to survey the many facets of a cultural and political relationship under stress and to examine, explain and comment upon the plans and attempts of various groups and individual leaders to adjust that relationship to coincide with their own conception of what was necessary and right -- Preface.</field><field name="date">1973</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">wars</field><field name="subject">King Movement</field><field name="subject">Kingitanga</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070621.140011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The concept of similarity in prehistoric studies : a test case using New Zealand stone flake assemblages.</field><field name="creator">Leach, B.F. (Foss)</field><field name="description">The concept of similarity has occupied a key position in the interpretation of archaeological evidence since Thomson&#65533;s Three Age System was formulated (Thomsen, 1836). Indeed, the writing of prehistory demands the use of this concept in relating evidence from stratigraphically distant horizons. Taylor, however, not only argued that too much emphasis could be placed on this comparative approach, but also claimed that it could be detrimental to the full recovery of archaeological information (W.W. Taylor, 1948). A similar dissatisfaction in Britain prompted Clark (1964, 1966, 1967) to adopt a &#65533;conjunctive approach&#65533; (W.W. Taylor, 1948:7) exemplified in their work as economic prehistorians. This reappraisal however, has increased rather than diminished the need for procedured designed to relate assemblages in cultural terms. While the development of methods of analysis which assess the similarity between comparable items of different assemblages proceeds, it is stressed that sound theoretical principles, whereby the results of such analyses may be interpreted in the most plausible manner, must be adopted. Indeed it is urged that the common assumption that the degree of cultural similarity is directly proportional to the formal similarity, is by no means universally valid.
	Considerable advances have recently been made in developing techniques to identify formal relationships by establishing the degree of &#65533;proximity&#65533; between different assemblages of information. The ancillary problem of interpreting results in cultural terms has received relatively less attention.
	This dissertation considers the application of methods of &#65533;proximity&#65533; analysis to specific New Zealand assemblages, together with a discussion of the problems encountered in interpretation.

Cumberland wrote the first geographical treatise on pre-20th century Maori settlement and livelihood in New Zealand, twenty-five major geographical studies on various aspects of the topic have been published. Of these, nine have been concerned with the nature of settlement, population distribution, and economy, as they varied from one area to another within New Zealand at given points in time. A further five studies, concerned with the historical geography of New Zealand in general, contain very brief accounts concerning the distribution of Maori population and the nature of the Maori economy in the 19th century. Four studies, relying on early European observations, have focused on the character of Maori settlement in particular regions: North West Nelson, Westland, Taupo County, and Tauranga County.

The communal Maori was deprived, during the nineteenth century, of his tribal structure, his lands, his religious faith and his mana or self-respect. This occurred in four stages: acceptance of a new faith and new techniques, distrust and war, desperation which produced a series of rectionary cults, and finally apathetic resignation to eventual extinction of the race.
	From the degenerate Maori situation at the turn of the century there grew &#65533;the Maori renaissance&#65533; which was prepared for by the ideas of the educated leaders, created by a general social movement and effected by means of legislation which was demanded by the morehu or common people. The latter did not follow the educated leaders but were given a channel of expression in the Ratana movement which was an important factor in the Maori revival.</field><field name="date">1956</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana</field><field name="subject">Ratana Church</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070622.144515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the Canterbury Maoris (Ngaitahu) with special reference to the land question</field><field name="creator">Evison, Harry</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 When Captain Cook skirted the coastline of Canterbury in 1770, the bleak and ill-defined shores which he could make out to westward, between squalls, appeared to offer little attraction for human habitation.

	With these words Dr. Martin, in 1845, outlined the need for special training for those who had to deal with native races, whether as missionaries, administrators, or merely as settlers amongst them. All those who came into contact with the Maoris had, of necessity, to study their ways to a certain extent, and some naturally, were more proficient in this than were their fellows. Wherever there was one who, through his understanding of the native character and the strength of his influence, was able to guide both Maori and Pakeha in their relations with one another, there the two peoples lived in peace. Dissension arose through the ignorance of either party of laws of the other, or because those laws were deliberately flouted. Training in the study of man, as suggested by Martin, would have dispelled this ignorance and inculcated a spirit of tolerance which could have eased much of the friction that ensued. Where it was essential to compromise on conflicting points, or where the weaker of the two parties was forced to conform to the ways of the other, then again this training would have indicated the best procedure to be adopted. But no system of schooling at that time included a study of anything like anthropology, which was then an unthought-of science, and the only hope of harmonious race relations lay in the possibility that certain of those in responsible positions amongst both Europeans and Maoris would have enough wit to discern the right course--Introduction.</field><field name="date">1949</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">material culture</field><field name="subject">social organization</field><field name="subject">origins</field><field name="subject">prehistory</field><field name="subject">missionaries</field><field name="subject">settlers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.095251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The South Island Maori population.</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, D.

This is as it should be, because that event was a watershed - albeit an unhappy one - in the settlement in this country. I therefore make no apology for adding another piece of research which includes a consideration of events in 1859 and 1860.
	I first &#65533;discovered&#65533; C.W. Richmond when asked to present a tutorial on him whilst engaged in post-graduate studies at the University of Otago. Regular histories of the period of the Anglo-Maori Wars were consulted, but they dealt with Richmond only in passing. It was at this point that G.H. Scholefield&#65533;s two volume edition of the Richmond-Atkinson family papers came to my attention and I discovered in them a wealth of information hitherto unrevealed about the Minister for Native Affairs. Accordingly, I was attracted to a study of the man, and the present paper is the result. The wonder is that so little has been written on a man who played a key role (one could argue the key role) in the Waitara dispute which led the Anglo-Maori Wars.

	Maori had developed a complex set of burial rituals by the beginning of the nineteenth century, practised within the framework of tangihanga. These included primary and secondary burial and limited memorialisation, with practices varying between iwi. Change and continuity characterised the development of Maori burial practices and materials, translated traditional practices into new materials, and new practices into traditional materials. Although urupa came to appear more European, they were still firmly embedded in the framework of tangihanga and notions of tapu.
	The nineteenth century settlement of New Zealand occurred at a time of transition in British burial practices, with the traditional churchyard burial ground giving way to the modern cemetery. The predominantly British settlers transplanted both institutions to the colonial context. The cemeteries, churchyards and burial grounds created in nineteenth century New Zealand were influenced by a great number of factors. These included the materials available, the religious and ethnic make up of settler society, regionalism, economic ties, major events, political and social conditions, means of establishment and function.
	These processes, events, and influences resulted in a rich yet neglected material culture of urupa, cemeteries, churchyards, burial grounds and lone graves which are today valuable components of our historic and cultural landscapes. Portions of this heritage have already been lost through decay and destruction. Neglect is now the major threat. Part of this neglect is due to the fact that we do not understand our cemeteries, what they show, how and why they have developed over time.  Neglect is also engendered by cultural perceptions of what is valuable. While Maori regard urupa and burial places as toanga and sacred sites, Pakeha have tended to ignore their historic cemeteries. Such attitudes have been reflected and enforced by the policy of external agencies such as the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. New Zealand&#65533;s nineteenth century cemeteries have a great but under-utilised research potential, which it is important to recognise if we wish to preserve them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cemeteries</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">death customes</field><field name="subject">tangihanga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070627.111502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural citizenship and the TVNZ charter : the possibility for multicultural representation in the commercial television environment.</field><field name="creator">Reid, Donald</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 Implemented in 2003, the TVNZ Charter is a one-page document that outlines the broadcaster&#65533;s objectives to deliver programming that represents New Zealand&#65533;s ethnically and socially diverse population.

	A Pakeha View
	I tell the story as I see it and people can read my material if they wish to but if they don&#65533;t then that is their problem. The trouble with New Zealanders is that they do not care about archaeology. The Maoris are the worst offenders. Their attitude is one of indifference, they couldn&#65533;t care less. When I have excavated on Maori land I have contacted the Maori organisations concerned and I have invited them to come along and observe what is being done because after all it is their history that I am digging up. However the decision is not really for the Maori to decide when I am working on Pakeha land, and anyway the land does not belong to the Maori, it belongs to all. I admit that I am sorry that archaeologists destroy sites but they do record them in their books.

Oceanographic processes determine the spatial distribution of seabird prey, while seasonality often has a temporal influence on prey availability. In penguins, these factors are reflected in the different species&#65533; foraging strategies. Penguins can broadly be categorized as inshore foragers that live in subtropical to temperate regions and profit from a stable food supply throughout the year close to their breeding sites, and offshore foragers that breed in a pelagic environment at higher latitudes where oceanographic processes and seasonality create much more dynamic, temporally limited prey situations. In this light, offshore foragers can be expected to be much more flexible in their foraging behaviour so as to quickly respond to changes in a dynamic marine environment, while inshore foragers are more likely to exhibit predictable foraging patterns. I examined the foraging ecology of two New Zealand penguin species - the offshore foraging Snares penguin Eudyptes robustus and the inshore foraging Yellow-eyed penguin Megadyptes antipodes and how their foraging strategies reflect an adaptation to the marine environment they exploit. 
 Diet composition of breeding Snares penguins (incubation and early chick-guard) was determined using the water-offloading method. Before the chicks hatched, the penguins generally brought little food back from their long foraging trips. During chick-guard, the stomach contents comprised mainly of crustaceans (~55%), fish (~24%) and cephalopods (~21%). However, the presence at times of many fish otoliths and squid beaks suggests that the latter two prey classes may play an even more important role in the adults&#65533; diet than the simple percentages based on mass suggest. The penguins&#65533; nesting routines were strongly synchronised between the years and correlated with the onset of the spring planktonic bloom. Using GPS data loggers and dive recorders I found that during the incubation phase, male penguins that performed long (ca. 2 week) foraging trips exhibited a strong affinity to forage in the Subtropical Front some 200 km east of the Snares. At that stage (late mid-October) the front featured elevated chlorophyll a concentrations, a pattern that can be observed every year. Thus, it seems that the front represents a reliable and predictable source of food for the male penguins. After the males returned, the female penguins also performed long foraging trips (&lt;1 week) but never reached the front, primarily because they had to time their return to the hatching of their chicks. After the chicks had hatched, the female Snares penguins were the sole providers of food. At this stage, the penguins performed short foraging trips (1-3 days) and foraged halfway between the Snares and Stewart Island (ca. 70-90 km north of the Snares), where nutrient-rich coastal waters flow eastwards to form the Southland Current. The penguins concentrated their diving effort in these waters, underlining the importance of the warm coastal waters as a food source for breeding Snares penguins. However, diving behaviour between 2003 and 2004 differed with penguins searching for prey at greater depths in the latter year. This underlines the Snares penguins&#65533; behavioural flexibility in response to a changing marine environment. 
 The Yellow-eyed penguins as typical inshore foragers showed very consistent foraging patterns at all stages. GPS logger deployments on penguins at Oamaru revealed that the birds foraged almost exclusively at the seafloor and targeted specific areas that featured reefs or epibenthic communities. As a result, the penguins&#65533; at-sea movements appeared conservative and at times almost stereotypic. Nevertheless, a comparison of Yellow-eyed penguins breeding on the adjacent Codfish and Stewart islands revealed a degree of plasticity in the species&#65533; foraging behaviour. Birds from Codfish Island extended their foraging ranges considerably and switched from primarily bottom to mid-water foraging during the post-guard stage of breeding. It seems likely that this switch is a result of enhanced feeding conditions (e.g. increased prey abundance/quality) in an area further away from the island, but the time required to get there renders this strategy not viable when chicks are small and need to be guarded and fed on a daily basis. As such, the change of behaviour represents a traditional pattern rather than a dynamic response to a sudden change in the marine environment. In comparison, penguins from Stewart Island showed consistent foraging patterns during all stages of breeding. Given the high levels of chick starvation on Stewart Island, the lack of plasticity in foraging behaviour is surprising and might indicate that Yellow-eyed penguins find it difficult to react quickly to a sub-optimal food situation. 
 Overall, it seems that Yellow-eyed penguins show a specialisation for a consistent benthic environment and, thus, lack the behavioural flexibility apparent in Snares penguins, which find their food in a changing pelagic marine environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eudyptes robustus</field><field name="subject">yellow-eyed penguin</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.150734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">God&#65533;s governor : George Grey and racial amalgamation in New Zealand 1845-1853</field><field name="creator">Grant, Susannah</field><field name="description">The legend of Governor Grey is a major feature of nineteenth century New Zealand historiography. This thesis seeks to understand Grey as a real person. Acknowledging the past as a strange and foreign place, it argues that Grey (and previous interpretations of him) can only be understood in context. The intellectual milieu of liberal Anglicanism and Victorian structures of imperial authority are crucial to understanding Grey&#65533;s policies of racial amalgamation. 
 Focusing on Grey&#65533;s first governorship of New Zealand, 1845 - 1853, this thesis begins by exploring the imperial networks within which he operated. The members of Grey&#65533;s web gathered and shared information to further a range of different agendas - scientific, humanitarian, and political. Grey&#65533;s main focus was native civilisation. His ideas about race were informed by liberal Anglican theology, scientific investigation and personal experience. Grey believed in the unity and improvability of all mankind. His mission as governor was to elevate natives to a state of true equality with Europeans so that all could progress together still further up the scale of civilisation. This model formed the basis of Grey&#65533;s 1840 plan for civilising native peoples, in which he proposed a range of measures to promote racial amalgamation in Australia. 
 Between 1845 and 1853 Grey implemented those measures in New Zealand. He used military force and British law to establish peace and enforce Crown authority. He used economic policies to encourage Maori integration in the colonial economy. He built schools and hospitals and enacted legislation to encourage the best features of British culture and limit the effects of its worst. He also augmented his power and encouraged amalgamation through personal relationships, official reports and the structures of colonial authority. 
 Grey was driven by complex, sometimes contradictory motives including personal gain, economic imperatives and political pressures. His policies have had ongoing, often devastating effects, on Maori and on race relations in New Zealand. This thesis brings to light the ideas and attitudes which formed them. Grey understood himself as a Christian governor ordained to civilise Maori and join them with British settlers in accordance with God&#65533;s divine plan for improving humankind.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Torangapu</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Government</field><field name="subject">Sir George Grey (1812-1898)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.112933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UVR exposure of NZ schoolchildren</field><field name="creator">Wright, Caradee Yael</field><field name="description">Excess exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the only readily modifiable skin cancer risk factor, and childhood exposure is implicated in melanoma aetiology. To assist the design and evaluation of child sun protection interventions in the school and community context, this first comprehensive study used electronic monitors to record time-stamped, second-by-second UVR exposure of 325 children (from 28 randomly selected New Zealand primary schools) who kept a diary record of concurrent activities and sun-protective practices and completed a sun-related knowledge, attitudes and usual behaviours questionnaire. School principals and Health promoters (HPs) were interviewed about school and community sun protection efforts. 
 Using the Haddon matrix and Ottawa Charter of Health Promotion to guide research, four potential domains of influence were identified: the physical and social environments, protective products, and host (child). Two key outcomes identified were child UVR exposure and sun-protective practices. A path model was developed where potential influences on these outcomes included school, community, host factors (demographics, skin type, sun-related attitudes, and sun-related knowledge), and pattern of concurrent outdoor activity. Seven specific hypotheses were defined to investigate the effects of host, school and community factors on UVR exposure, sun-protective practices, and sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. 
 To test for the effects of host factors, day of the week and activity on UVR exposure and sun-protective practices, linear mixed models containing these factors and interactions between Year level-sex, activity-Year level and activity-sex, accounting for clustering within schools and allowing for repeated measures, were applied. Logistic regression with a random school effect was used to assess differences in scored student questionnaire items. Structural equation modelling was implemented to consider associations between sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, and other explanatory factors for variations in UVR exposure and sun-protective practices. 
 Three of the seven specific hypotheses were supported. There were statistically significant differences in UVR exposure by sex, skin type, day of the week and activity, and sex-activity and Year level-activity interactions. Passive pursuits were associated with the highest UVR exposure rates compared to outdoor active, travel and unclassified pursuits. 
 There were statistically significant differences in sun-protective practices by sex, ethnicity and skin type, and sex-activity and Year level-activity interactions. Girls tended to have higher sun protection scores than boys, but were more likely to sunbathe and use sunscreen. Children identifying with Pacific Island ethnicities had higher scores than children with other ethnicities, and children with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II had higher scores than children with skin types III, IV and V. 
 School and community factors were not associated with UVR exposure, sun-protective practices, sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, but school and HPs&#65533; scores were relatively high, reflecting the significant time and effort spent promoting youth sun protection. 
 Trends for Year level indicated that whereas child sun-related knowledge increased with Year level, attitudes and behaviours supportive of sun protection declined. When considering sun-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours simultaneously, knowledge was only significantly associated with behaviours when mediated by attitudes.

A series of Zn(II) tetraphenylporphyrins with conjugated functional groups at the &#946;-position have been used with success in liquid heterojunction dye-sensitized solar cells. The vibrational spectra and optoelectronic properties of the two classes were investigated using Raman, resonance Raman and transient resonance Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory methods. 
 Density functional theory frequency calculations were used to aid vibrational mode assignments for the dppz compounds, and show close agreement with the experimental non-resonance Raman spectra. The enhancement of modes which are localized on differing sections of the ligand was identified. The nature of the absorbing chromophores for the dppz ligands and complexes was established using resonance Raman spectroscopy in concert with vibrational assignments from calculations. Transient resonance Raman spectra of the ligands provided spectral signatures for the triplet ligand-centred state; these features were observed in the TR&#65533; spectra of the metal complexes, along with other features attributable to MLCT states. 
 Electroluminescent devices were fabricated using the dppz ligands and complexes as emissive dopants, and their properties investigated. The optoelectronic behaviour of the devices was found to be influenced by the mechanism of exciton formation on the dopant. The device properties were also dependent on the dopant concentration, the concentrations of other components and the driving voltage. 
 The electronic structure of the porphyrin compounds was investigated using time-dependent density functional theory methods. Comparison of calculated optical transitions with experimental data shows that the calculations predict trends in the optical absorption spectra with change of functional group and with increase in conjugation chain length. The calculations suggest that the electron-withdrawing substituent decreases the configuration interaction effect by breaking the degeneracy of the two lowest unoccupied MOs, and other configuration interaction effects come into play involving other frontier MOs. Interrupting the conjugation of the functional group is shown to mitigate the breakdown of the configuration interaction. 
 The perturbation of the normal electronic structure of the porphyrin by the substituent was also investigated using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Vibrational analysis identified bands due to the substituent, implying coupling between the porphyrin and substituent chromophores. Changes in frequency of porphyrin core modes due to the differing substituents and different metal centres were reproduced by density functional theory calculations. 
 This project has allowed the spectroscopic investigation of the active optical states in a number of polypyridyl and porphyrin compounds, and determined the efficacy of DFT and TDDFT calculations to predict the properties of these compounds.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porphyrins</field><field name="subject">spectra</field><field name="subject">electroluminescence</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070927.151236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weeds, people and contested places : selected themes from the history of New Zealanders and their weeds 1770-1940</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Neil</field><field name="description">This study examines three basic questions. Why did so many familiar floral species with which agricultural people have more or less successfully contested places for some 10,000 years apparently become highly problematic in New Zealand? How did those in whom the developing contest aroused considerable anxiety try to solve the problems they saw emerging? And what were the outcomes of their chosen courses of action? This study is organised around three main themes, science, the law and agricultural practices. Within each theme I take into consideration the ways New Zealanders used particular aspects of these broad disciplines to try to identify, understand and solve the problems they perceived to have been caused by their weedy biota. I also consider the extent to which recourse to these means has helped or hindered the ends they sought. 
 The methodology adopted for this study is a variation of an 'organisational approach', advocated by the German environmental historian Frank Uekoetter. It focuses on the ways responses to perceived environmental problems are organised within a society. From my use of Uekoetter&#65533;s model I conclude that, despite a number of setbacks during the mid to late 19th century, by 1939 New Zealanders had developed highly dynamic processes within their weed science, extending into the wider farming community, by which they could feel their way with some confidence into a future where they might better manage the contest with their weeds, if not actually eradicate them.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">weeds</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">protection</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071129.105550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pastoralism and the transformation of the rangelands of the South Island of New Zealand 1841 to 1912 : Mt Peel Station, a case study</field><field name="creator">Peden, Robert L</field><field name="description">The transformation of the rangelands of the South Island of New Zealand during the pastoral era fits into the wider international context of European expansion into the 'new' world. European settlers displaced native peoples, introduced 'old' world animals and plants, and imposed a capitalist system that converted local resources into international commodities. In New Zealand the orthodox explanation of the pastoral impact on the rangelands claims that pastoralists introduced an unsustainable system of land use to the region. The pastoralists&#65533; indiscriminate burning practices and overstocking with sheep opened up the country to invasion by rabbits. Burning and overgrazing by sheep and rabbits stripped the natural fertility of the soils and left the country depleted, eroded, and overwhelmed by pests and weeds. 
 This thesis sets out to test those claims. It explores burning, the stocking of the rangelands with sheep and the impact of rabbits in detail. It also examines other land management practices, as well as sheep breeding, to see what impact they had on the landscape. The timeframe is set between 1841, when formal British settlement was established in the South Island, and 1912, by which time most of the great estates and stations had been broken up into smaller runs and farms. 
 The thesis uses station diaries, memoirs, contemporary newspapers and farming journals to assess what happened on the ground during the pastoral era. In particular, the thesis uses Mt Peel Station as a case study to examine the intensification in land use that took place between 1841 and 1912, in order to explain the transformation of the landscape and to answer the questions: what happened, how did it happened and why did it happened as it did? 
 These sources illustrate that the pastoral era was characterised by innovation. Pastoralists had access to technical and scientific information from around the world. Some conducted their own experiments to improve the productivity of the land and their stock. There was also a learning process involved in adapting their methods to fit the local rangeland environments. They were not simply rapacious capitalists out to strip the wealth from the land for their own personal gain; indeed, many pastoralists set out to establish viable and sustainable enterprises. 
 The thesis argues that the rangelands consisted of a variety of landscapes and climates. Differences in resource endowments had a considerable influence in shaping the environmental outcomes on different stations. Aridity and rabbits were two key factors in the depletion of the vegetation and the degradation of the landscape in the rangelands. Runs in semi-arid districts that were overwhelmed by rabbits suffered long-term damage. In districts where rainfall was more reliable stations that had been overrun by rabbits recovered remarkably quickly. Stations like Mt Peel, that were largely unaffected by the first rabbit plague, were able to maintain and even increase their productivity up to the time they were subdivided. The orthodox analysis of the transformation of the rangelands in the pastoral era does not account for these differences in outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sheep ranches</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">right of pasture</field><field name="subject">pastoral systems</field><field name="subject">Timaru district</field><field name="subject">Mount Peel Station</field><field name="subject">Mt Peel</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.155512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal risk management in pilots</field><field name="creator">Pauley, Keryn A</field><field name="description">Risk management is a key component of aeronautical decision-making and one of the possible causes of pilot error (e.g., Jensen, Guilke, &amp; Hunter, 1997). Risk management encompasses risk perception and risk tolerance. Risk perception involves the detection of risks associated with a situation, whereas risk tolerance is the willingness to accept a given degree of risk (Hunter, 2002). Previous studies using flight simulators have found that risk perception and risk tolerance differs between pilots who fly into adverse weather and those who do not (e.g., O&#65533;Hare, Owen, Jorgensen, Wiegmann, Hunter, &amp; Mullen, 2007). The aim of this research was to assess risk perception and risk tolerance using scenario-based measures. The measure of risk perception was developed over three studies. Since risk perception is a skill which expert pilots exercise (Jensen et al., 1997), I used the Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau (CWS, Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003) index to measure how good pilots were at perceiving aeronautical risks. Weiss and Shanteau assumed that an expert should be able to discriminate between two relevant stimuli, and do so consistently. Participants were presented with flight scenarios and rated the risk involved in each scenario from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk). If a valid measure of expertise in risk perception, those with experience in aeronautical decision-making should have been better at this task. In study one the qualified pilots had higher and more variable CWS scores than the non-pilots, suggesting that some pilots were expert at this task, whereas most non-pilots were poor at this task. The focus of study two was shifted to weather-related decision-making (WRDM). Geography students, student pilots, and qualified pilots did not differ in their mean CWS scores, although the qualified pilots were most discriminating, and the geography students were most consistent. To decrease the reliance of the task on memory, study three included a blocking task in between each scenario. While only a small scale study, the results suggested that the blocking task improved the qualified pilots&#65533; performance while the geography students&#65533; performance deteriorated. In study four, I used Lopes&#65533;s (1987) theory to measure risk tolerance in pilots. According to Lopes (1987), risk tolerant individuals are motivated by opportunity, or what they can gain from taking risks, whereas risk averse individuals are motivated by threat, or what they can lose from taking risks. Qualified pilots were presented with 36 flight scenarios, varying in the level of threat and opportunity. The pilots rated the likelihood of going on the flights. Multiple regression equations were calculated, measuring the influence of threat and opportunity on each pilot&#65533;s ratings. Pilots were largely risk averse, as their ratings were influenced by threat. The two pilots whose ratings were influenced by opportunity had experienced more aviation incidents compared to the pilots who were not influenced by opportunity. The aim of study five was to assess the relationship between risk management and in-flight WRDM. Qualified pilots completed a simulated flight into adverse weather, and four-computer based measures: the expertise in risk perception measure developed in study three, the risk tolerance measure developed in study four, and two implicit association tests assessing implicit risk perception and anxiousness towards adverse weather. Twelve pilots continued beyond the critical decision point, 18 pilots diverted, and 2 pilots crashed. There was no relationship between in-flight WRDM and expertise in weather-related risk perception. However, the pilots who diverted gave higher ratings of risk during the CWS task compared to the pilots who crashed. The pilots who diverted also tended to be more risk averse and implicitly perceived more risk in adverse weather, compared to the pilots who continued, suggesting a relationship between risk management and decision-making in a simulated flight into adverse weather. These five studies further highlight the role of risk management in pilot decision-making. The tools developed in these studies have potential for measuring risk management in pilots.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aeronautics</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">air pilots</field><field name="subject">flight</field><field name="subject">weather</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071010.090032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of osseointegration in conventionally versus immediately restored implants in a sheep model</field><field name="creator">Kim, James H</field><field name="description">Objectives: To compare the osseointegration of conventionally and immediately restored tapered implants in a split-mouth animal model, and to compare different methods of analysis for measuring osseointegration. 
 Materials &amp; Methods: Twenty tapered implants were placed in the posterior mandibles of ten sheep, three months after premolar extractions. Ten control implants were placed and were restored after three months submerged healing. Ten test implants were placed on the contralateral side at this time and immediately restored. Animals were sacrificed after a further three months healing. Resonance frequency analysis (Implant Stability Quotient, ISQ), and standardized radiographs were taken at all stages. Alveolar bone height relative to the implant shoulder was measured on digitized radiographs. Histomorphometric and micro-Computed Tomograph ([mu]CT) morphometric analysis for Bone-to-Implant Contact (BIC) and Bone Density (BD) were performed. Radiographic, stability and morphometric measurements were compared statistically. 
 Results: Only three (30%) of conventionally restored and two (20%) immediately restored implants survived (p = 0.74). Mean crestal bone level after three months loading differed significantly (control 5.3 &#65533; 0.9 mm versus test 0.9 &#65533; 1.3 mm; p = 0.02). Control implants lost more crestal bone over three months than test implants but this was not statistically significant (3.5 &#65533; 1.0 mm versus 0.7 &#65533; 1.0 mm; p = 0.06). The test group showed a higher mean ISQ value (85.4 &#65533; 6.9) compared to the control group (72 &#65533; 14.4; p = 0.349). Both groups showed a slightly reduced stability during the loaded period. This was more marked for the test group but not statistically significant (-0.5 &#65533; 3.8 ISQ versus -4.35 &#65533; 6.6 ISQ; p = 0.8). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the loss of crestal bone and ISQ with loading (Pearson&#65533;s coefficient of correlation r = -0.473 p = 0.026). Both groups showed a statistically significant difference in BIC for both histomorphometric analaysis (HMA); p = 0.039 and [mu]CT morphometric analysis; p = 0.013. When the two forms of morphometric analysis were compared, HMA and [mu]CT morphometric analysis differed significantly for both BIC (p = 0.05) and BD (p = 0.048). However, a statistically significant correlation was found between the two measuring techniques, for both BIC (r = 0.335 p = 0.013) and BD (r = 0.439 p = 0.01). 
 Conclusions: The placement of wide-bodied 3i Osseotite NT[TM] tapered implants into sheep mandible resulted in high failure rate regardless of the loading protocol. The sheep mandibular model may be inappropriate as a model for evaluation of immediate loading, and to test implants which are designed for soft bone. Further investigations are needed to look into the variations in bone microstructure along with their impact on the mechanics of implant-bone union. Although a statistically significant difference was found between the two measurement techniques, a positive correlation was found between HMA and [mu]CT morphometric analysis suggesting non-invasive methods may have a potential in assessing osseointegration. Further research is required to optimize the variables in [mu]CT analysis, such as, voltage, filters, and thresholding to minimize artifacts and to maximize bone contrast when titanium implants are present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osseointegrated dental implants</field><field name="subject">osseointegration</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">alveolar process</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071206.162016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Espiritu de subversion : la construccion del discurso de la mujer en la narrativa posmoderna hispanoamericana</field><field name="creator">Regoczy, Lucia Graciela</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a typology of Postmodern women&#65533;s discourse from a sociological perspective. By focusing on the reading of Gioconda Belli&#65533;s Sofia de los presagios, Isabel Allende&#65533;s Paula, and Anacristina Rossi&#65533;s La loca de Gandoca, it examines how each writer achieves, thanks to the process of dialogism and the carnivalesque, a critique of social and aesthetic values, associated with Eurocentric discourse. 
 Thanks to these two processes, the values associated with the marginalized position of women in Latin America, are brought to the surface, offering a better understanding of the relation that exists between women&#65533;s literary production and the cultural environment. 
 Chapter one offers an overview of the concepts associated with Posmodernism, and its relevance in the Latin American context. This chapter also outlines the key concepts associated with dialogism and the carnivalesque. 
 Chapter two examines the use of the carnivalesque in two plays by Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Los empenos de una casa and Amor es mas laberinto as antecedents of subversive writing in Spanish American women&#65533;s writing. It discusses how Sor Juana through appropriation and inversion, transforms her texts into a critique of marginalized social groups. This chapter proposes that Sor Juana sets the model for the subversive nature of Spanish American women&#65533;s writing. 
 Chapter three offers a reading of Cristina Peri Rossi&#65533;s El libro de mis primos as an example of radical feminist discourse produced in the 60&#65533;s, focusing on the use of parody and irony as means of transgressing patriarchal discourse. 
 Chapter four examines Gioconda Belli&#65533;s Sofia de los presagios, and the incorporation of ancestral and modern myths, to accentuate women&#65533;s marginality and the conflicting and contradictory nature of Nicaraguan society. 
 Chapter five focuses on a reading of Isabel Allende&#65533;s Paula in which the techniques of magical realism and the carnivalesque are brought together to criticize social and cultural practices that marginalize women. 
 Chapter six examines Anacristina Rossi&#65533;s La loca de Gandoca. It focuses on the way Rossi makes use of popular music, romantic literature, poetry, and bureaucratic discourse, to denounce the exploitation and destruction of Costa Rica&#65533;s natural resources through ecotourism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spanish</field><field name="subject">American</field><field name="subject">Latin America</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">authors</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="subject">carnival</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">Sister Juana Ines de la Cruz (1651-1695)</field><field name="subject">Cristina Peri Rossi (1941-)</field><field name="subject">Gioconda  Belli (1948-)</field><field name="subject">Isabel Allende</field><field name="subject">Anacristina Rossi</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070927.141659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the population biology of the southern arrow squid, Nototodarus sloanii, in southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McKinnon, Jean Fiona</field><field name="description">Nototodarus sloanii is an important component of the Southern Ocean fauna, and the basis of a large commercial fishery. Despite this, much is unknown about the biology of this species. This study examines some aspects of the biology of N. sloanii. 
 Stomach contents analysis identified no significant differences in diet between male and female squid. Sixteen putative species, including 12 identifiable teleosts, 2 crustaceans, and 2 cephalopods were identified in the diet of this species. The euphausid, Nyctiphanes australis was the most important prey item, Lanternfish, Lampanyctodes hectoris, and Pearlside, Maurolicus muelleri, were of secondary importance. 
 Squid were aged using counts of statolith micro-increments and back-calculation from the date of capture showed that hatching occurred between August and February, with a peak in the austral winter/spring and another smaller peak in the austral summer. Growth rate for male squid differed depending on whether squid were hatched in the winter/spring or summer. Growth rates were more variable in the winter/spring-hatched individuals, and they attained larger size than summer-hatched squid. This was not the case for female squid. Mean age for immature winter/spring-hatched squid was significantly higher than for summer-hatched squid, although there was no significant difference in mean mantle length or body mass. No significant differences between mean age, mantle length, or body mass for same-gender mature squid, regardless of hatch season, were apparent. However, mature female squid hatched in the winter/spring season were significantly longer (ML) than mature male squid hatched in winter/spring. No squid was found to be older than 211 days. All squid had started to mature by 91-120 days old and all were fully mature at 180 days. 
 Validation experiments run on juvenile squid using calcein markers were inconclusive, however the increments in the statoliths were very similar to those found in other validated species of ommastrephid squid, thus for the purposes of this study they were assumed to be of daily periodicity. 
 Gladius increments identify a gender difference in growth rate, with female squid having a shorter initial slow growth phase than male squid. 
 Gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) were calculated for male and female squid. These were low (7.12%&#65533;0.3% for females and 1.9%&#65533;0.2% for males) suggesting that these squid are intermittent spawners. This is further supported by a histological examination, which found germinal cells of different stages present in the same gonad. Lack of mature individuals in this study means that these results are suggestive rather than definitive; more examination of the reproductive process of this squid is required. Histological examination was also used to validate the Lipinski maturity scale for use with this species, while some misidentification occurred the scale is useful to place squid into the broad categories of immature, maturing, or mature. New maturity scales were created for N. sloanii utilising these broad categories. Finer-scale identification is not possible using this scale, as maturation appears to be a continuous process. 
 Morphometric measurements were taken from both hard and soft tissues and were analysed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity. Divisions were only apparent in the hard structure measurements. They did not appear to be age, dietary or reproductive differences.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">squids</field><field name="subject">nototodarus</field><field name="subject">aquatic</field><field name="subject">invertebrate</field><field name="subject">populations</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.161531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a high throughput fluorescent screening assay for genetic recoding</field><field name="creator">Cardno, Tony Stuart</field><field name="description">The development of new drug therapies traditionally requires mass screening of thousands if not millions of substances to identify lead compounds. They are then further optimised to increase potency. The screening of the large pharmaceutical compound libraries can be incredibly expensive, with the industry responding by miniaturising the assays to smaller formats, enabling the compound screening to be automated and, importantly, eliminating assay reagents that are a major contributing cost for running large screens. 
 A potential target for such an approach is the genetic recoding site of viruses like HIV-1 and SARS. They use programmed recoding of the genetic code to regulate the translation of necessary proteins required for viable virus production. For example HIV-1 uses a -1 frameshift mechanism to regulate the ratio of the Gag to the Pol proteins, crucial for viable virus formation. 
 The study of recoding, including readthrough of premature termination codons have most recently used bicistronic reporters with different combinations of enzymes. The most widely used plasmid bicistronic reporter utilises a dual luciferase arrangement comprised of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase reporters flanking the DNA being studied. Both of the luciferase enzymatic reporters emit light in response to their respective substrates. The cost of these substrates is the major issue to using luciferase reporters for high throughput screening. 
 My study aimed at designing and developing a bicistronic assay suitable for genetic recoding that was amenable to high throughput screening. The luciferase reporters were replaced with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporters that do not require the addition of substrates. The development of a dual GFP assay required the appropriate selection of GFP fluorophores, the best arrangement of the GFPs to maximise the ratio of relative fluorescence intensity signal to background, the optimisation of the cells and growth conditions, DNA transfection, plate reader selection, and optical filter sets. Cassettes encoding protein linkers were also incorporated into the design of the constructs to separate the fluorescent proteins spatially to facilitate unimpaired folding into their functional units within the fusion protein. The assay was further improved by moving from transient transfection to stably expressing cell lines. A viable assay was almost achieved for 96 (and 384) well plates with a Z&#65533; factor compatible with the assay being suitable for high throughput screening. 
 The assay was used to test a small collection of compounds known to interact with the ribosome and compounds known in the literature to affect frameshifting. This proof of concept was important, since it showed that the assay, with the various modifications, optimisations and miniaturisation steps, still retained the capability of correctly measuring the -1 frameshifting efficiency at the HIV-1 recoding site, and recording compound-induced modulations to the frameshifting efficiency. The compounds cycloheximide and anisomycin, for example, were shown to decrease -1 frameshifting albeit at some expense to overall protein synthesis. 
 The dual GFP assay was also shown to be able to measure accurately changes in the frameshift efficiency brought about by mutations to the frameshift element, and additionally, it would be suitable for the detection and study of compounds, like the recently reported PTC-124 (currently undergoing phase II clinical trial for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and cystic fibrosis) that increases readthrough of a UGA premature stop codon mutation. 
 The dual GFP assay developed in this study is at most only 1/10th of the cost of a comparable dual luciferase assay, largely due to removal of assay substrates and transfection reagents. The assay has a robust Z&#65533; factor comparable to that of the dual luciferase assay, and would substantially decrease the costs of high throughput screening in situations where a bicistronic reporter is required. The HIV-1 frameshift element is such a site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">code</field><field name="subject">fluorescent screens</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.145806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution of the perirhinal cortex to the firing properties of hippocampal pyramidal neurons</field><field name="creator">Lu, Xiaodong</field><field name="description">The hippocampus appears to carry out spatial memory processing and navigation. As one of the inputs to the hippocampus originates in the perirhinal cortex and the spatial behaviour is affected by lesion of the perirhinal cortex, this structure may be critical for the functioning of hippocampal place cells. To investigate this hypothesis, the firing properties of hippocampal place cells were compared between control rats and rats with perirhinal cortex lesions. 
 Rats were randomly assigned to control and lesion groups. Animals from both groups received recording electrode implantation and the lesion group rats received bilateral perirhinal cortex lesions. In experiment 1, the control and lesioned rats moved freely in an open field. In experiment 2, the control and lesion rats ran for reward in a linear track with either horizontal or vertical grating pattern stimulation along both sidewalls. These two experiments examined the spatial firing and movement-related firing properties of the control and lesion groups; and the theta-related firing properties of the two groups. In addition, experiment 2 investigated the influence of optic flow on these properties between the two groups. In experiment 3, the control and lesion rats were passively moved in the linear track with either a horizontal or vertical grating pattern on both sidewalls. This experiment examined the spatial firing and movement-related firing properties and also investigated the influences of optic flow, motor efferent and proprioceptive information on the firing properties of the control and lesion groups&#65533; place cells. 
 The perirhinal cortex lesion affected the spatial firing properties of hippocampal place cells. The place field size in the lesion group was significantly reduced compared to the control group in both open field and linear track experiments. The lesion also altered the movement-related firing properties. The positive relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate was disrupted by the perirhinal cortex lesion whether the animals freely ran in the open field or in the linear track. In the open field study, the perirhinal cortex lesion altered the theta-related firing pattern, and the lesion disrupted phase precession in the linear track experiment. Phase precession is that when a rat passes through the place field, the firing of the cell advances progressively and systematically across the phase of the theta cycle from a late to an early phase of the cycle. The lesion also induced poorer theta "quality" of the EEG recorded at the hippocampal fissure. Optic flow affected the spatial firing of hippocampal place cells. The place field size was smaller in both the control and lesion group when the animals received vertical grating pattern stimulation compared to the horizontal grating condition. Change in the levels of optic flow stimulation did not, however, influence the relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate in the control group. When the animals were passively moved in a linear track, many of the place cells of both the groups stopped firing. The remaining cells from the control and lesion groups still displayed a place field. The cells in the control group lost the positive relationship between the animal&#65533;s movement speed and place cell&#65533;s firing rate. 
 The perirhinal cortex lesion affected the spatial, movement- related and theta-related firing properties of hippocampal place cells. Change of optic flow had a subtle effect on the movement-related firing properties of the place cells. The PrhC lesion therefore disrupted motor efferent and proprioceptive input to the HPC rather than visual sensory information. Motor efferent / proprioceptive or vibrissae information may be conveyed from related cortex to the perirhinal cortex. This information may then project from the perirhinal cortex to the hippocampus directly or indirectly via the entorhinal cortex.

 Research design and methods: A 2x2 multifactorial design was used to compare two support programmes and two diets differing in macronutrient composition on maintenance of weight loss over a 2-year period. Two hundred women who had recently lost at least 5% of initial body weight were randomised into one of two support programmes. One provided intensive expert, health professional support with regular circuit training classes. The other provided brief and frequent &#65533;weigh-ins&#65533; and support facilitated by a nurse. Participants were also randomised with regard to recommended diet composition. One eating plan was high in carbohydrate and dietary fibre, emphasising low glycemic index foods. The second eating plan was relatively high in monounsaturated fat and protein and had a low overall glycaemic load. At baseline, 1 and 2-years, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured and body composition was estimated using bioelectrical impedance. Three-day weighed diet records were collected to estimate dietary intake. A fasting blood sample was used to measure glucose, insulin and lipids. 
 Results: At 2-years weight was measured for 87% of participants. On average those randomised to the Expert Support Programme reduced weight by 2.5kg while those on the Nurse Support Programme reduced weight by 3.6kg (difference between support programmes, P=0.976). On the High Carbohydrate Diet average weight loss was 2.4kg compared with a loss of 3.8kg on the High Monounsaturated fat Diet (difference between diets, P=0.419). 
 At follow-up, there were no signficant differences between the support programmes with regards to body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, blood lipid levels, glucose, insulin, and predicted insulin sensitivity. From a health system perspective and relative to the Nurse Support Programme, the Expert Support Programme cost $NZ 928, 970 per QALY gained (or $9, 290 per person). 
 At follow-up, there were no signficant differences between the dietary prescriptions with regard to body composition, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin and predicted insulin sensitivity. However, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower on the High Carbohydrate Diet compared with the High Monounsaturated fat Diet (total cholesterol 0.2mmol/l, P=0.044, LDL cholesterol 0.2mmol/l, P=0.042). At follow-up those on the High Monounsaturated fat Diet reported significantly higher intakes of saturated fat (1.5%TE), total fat (5%TE), monounsaturated fat (2.4%), and a significantly lower intake of carbohydrate (-5%TE) than those on the High Carbohydrate Diet. 
 Conclusion: A relatively inexpensive nurse led programme appears to be as effective as a more costly expert health professional led programme in achieving weight maintenance over a 2-year period. This inexpensive and successful weight maintenance programme offers a feasible option for implementation in primary health care in New Zealand. Similarly, both dietary approaches produced comparable beneficial effects in terms of weight loss maintenance. However the High Carbohydrate Diet was associated with lower levels of total and LDL cholesterol, possibly due to a lower intake of saturated fat.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weight loss</field><field name="subject">health aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080129.122806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health risk assessment and health risk management with special reference to sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) for Possum control in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Foronda, Natalia</field><field name="description">The principal use of sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) in New Zealand is to control brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Aerial application of baits containing 1080 is the most common method used for large-scale control of possums. 
 The use of 1080 attracts a great deal of controversy, in particular the effects on the environmental, non-target species, and the potential chronic effects in humans associated with environmental exposures. Although the nature of the acute toxicity of 1080 has been known for more than fifty years, little is known of its effects on humans, in particular its chronic effects to environmental exposures. 
 A benchmark dose (BMD) as an alternative to a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) approach was investigated as a means to improve current health risk assessment values of 1080. Both approaches were investigated for three critical toxicological end points, namely cardiomyopathy, testicular toxicity and teratogenic effects identified from the few available critical studies. The calculated BMDs and lower-bound confidence limits (BMDLs) for the three end points were estimated using the Weibull, probit and quanntal linear models. A benchmark response (BMR) of 10% (extra risk) was chosen and the Akaike&#65533;s information criterion (AIC) was used in selecting the appropriate model. The BMDL estimates derived were generally slightly higher but comparable to the corresponding NOAEL for those same endpoints. The computed BMD&#8321;&#8320; and BMDL&#8321;&#8320; for cardiomyopathy and testicular effects were 0.21 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533; and 0.10 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533;, respectively. Tolerable Daily Intakes (TDIs) were derived using the NOAEL approach and the BMD methodology and applying an uncertainty factor of 3000. The resulting TDI using the BMDL were generally consistently slightly higher than those derived using the NOAEL approach. Based on the best fit of modelled dose-response data, a TDI of 0.03 [mu]g kg&#8315;&#65533;bw&#8315;&#65533;day&#8315;&#65533; is proposed for human health risk assessment. 
 Two sets of Provisional Maximum Acceptable Values (PMAV) were derived using the highest concentration of 4.0 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; 1080 found in water (N=1450), and using the maximum allowable concentration of 2.0 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; of 1080 in water for adults (0.58 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; and 0.94 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;, respectively) and children (0.23 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; and 0.4 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;, respectively). Parameters used in the derivation of PMAVs were average weight, average quantity of water consumed, and proportion of total intake allocated to drinking water. The derived adult PMAV of 0.60 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533; is proposed in revising the PMAV for 1080 in the Drinking Water Standards New Zealand. This value is 6-fold lower than the current PMAV of 3.5 [mu]g L&#8315;&#65533;. Additional toxicology studies are recommended to meet the definition of a "complete database" and therefore estimating a more defensible TDI, and consequently a PMAV for 1080. 
 Risk management approaches are consistent with the Ministry of Health&#65533;s current precautionary approach. A PMAV of 0.60 [mu]gL&#8315;&#65533; in drinking water is recommended to consider it suitable for human consumption and that continuous monitoring be carried if the level of 1080 exceeds 50% of the proposed PMAV as a requirement for Priority 2 determinands in the Drinking Water Standards. Precautionary approach appears to be warranted and this was supported by information provided by the Public Health Units (PHU) where 1080 was permitted to be dropped onto drinking water catchments. The PHUs exercised precautionary measures by imposing appropriate conditions to suit local circumstances. As 1080 may likely remain an essential tool to contain tuberculosis spread by possums and to reduce possum damage to forests and crops until better methods of control are developed, a number of recommendations were proposed to protect public health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sodium fluoroacetate</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080131.145423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of genes associated with telomere maintenance mechanisms in gliomas</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yu-Jen</field><field name="description">The overall survival for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not improved in two decades. A better understanding of the molecular basis for gliomagenesis would aid therapeutic advances. Recombinational based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) distinct from telomerase, which serves as a prognostic factor in GBM. In this thesis, I have compared components of the p53 axis, namely p53, p21[WAF-1] and the paired box-containing transcription factors (PAX) PAX2, 5, and 8, with TMM in gliomas. 
 Analysis of TP53 status in relation to TMM in 110 gliomas revealed that activation of ALT during tumorigenesis possibly requires loss of normal TP53 function (P &lt; 0.0001). Overexpression of p21[WAF-1] was also found to correlate with telomerase-positive gliomas (P = 0.0002). Moreover, high p21[WAF-1] expression is a poor prognostic factor in patients under 56 years (P = 0.015). Telomere length (TL) was also found as a prognostic factor, such that short TL (&lt; 5 kb) is a poor prognostic factor in the group without defined TMM ("None")(P = 0.0160). 
 Pax2,5 and 8 belong to Group II of the PAX family. They are expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and in the neural tube of the vertebrate embryo, whereas their expression levels are low in the adult brain. To explore their roles in glioma pathology, I analyzed mRNA levels in 54 gliomas and 16 established glioma cell lines. Increased levels of PAX8 mRNA were detected in 74.1% of gliomas and 62.5% of established glioma cell lines by real time PCR. Sixty-six percent of glioma specimens expressed high levels of active PAX2, 5, and 8 by immunohistochemistry. There were more males than females having high PAX2 expression (P = 0.0408). Suppression of PAX8 by small interfering RNA induced glioma cell death, independent of TP53 status. These findings identify PAX8 as a survival factor for GBM, and PAX2, 5, and 8 expression as contributing to the aggressive behavior of gliomas. 
 The mRNA level of PAX8 showed a positive correlation with telomerase activity in glioma biopsies (r&#65533; = 0.75, P &lt; 0.001). The relationship was explored and I found that PAX2 and PAX8 are able to activate the reporter constructs of both the catalytic subunit (hTERT) and the RNA component (hTR) of telomerase. PAX8 had a stronger effect than PAX2 on the activation of the hTERT and hTR promoters. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Western blotting and telomerase activity assay, I showed that PAX8 bound directly to hTERT and hTR promoters, and upregulated hTERT protein and telomerase activity. Moreover, gliomas carrying wild type TP53 had higher levels of PAX8 expression compared to those with mutant TP53 (P = 0.0075) suggesting that PAX8 is significant only in some GBMs during gliomagenesis. These results show that the oncofetal proteins, PAX2 and PAX8, may have roles in telomerase regulation. 
 Taken together, molecular markers examined in this thesis suggest gliomas with different TMMs are derived from different pathways.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telomere</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">gliomas</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.155343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cryostability of large unilamellar vesicles in relation to the effect of cryoprotective agents on ice matrix</field><field name="creator">Siow, Lee Fong</field><field name="description">Freeze-injury at the plasma membrane level has been identified as being crucial for the survival of living matter. Since plasma membranes consist of several micro domains that make the structure rather complex, this study attempted to use simple model membranes to investigate the changes of phospholipid bilayers at sub-zero temperatures. Egg yolk L-&#945;-phosphatidylcholine (EPC) and 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) that mimic plasma membranes in their unique ways were used to prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), which were the model membranes of this study. 
 At cooling rates of 0.5 and 10&#65533;C/min, LUV were freeze-concentrated in the unfrozen matrix as a result of the advancing extraliposomal ice front and the decreasing phase volume of the unfrozen matrix, both of which led to membrane lesion. At the slow cooling rate of 0.5&#65533;C/min, an additional freezing stress imposed by the osmotic gradient across the bilayers, due to the increase of solute concentration in the unfrozen matrix, promoted leakage of LUV. 
 The gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature of phospholipids played an important role in determining if the LUV could withstand freezing stress when the LUV were held at a defined sub-zero temperature for a given period of holding time. EPC LUV were more leaky than DPPC LUV when they were held at the high sub-zero temperatures and their leakage increased with increasing holding time. The leakiness of EPC LUV could be related to the fluid and deformable nature of the EPC above its phase transition temperature. In contrast, DPPC LUV with a higher gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature compared to EPC may become increasingly fragile at lower sub-zero temperatures, which led to the increase of leakage when the DPPC LUV were held at the lower sub-zero temperatures. These results indicated that the determination of the fatty acid profile of the plasma membranes was essential to aid in developing the most suitable holding temperature and time during the cryopreservation of biological specimens. Adding to the integrity of LUV that depended on the gel-liquid crystal phase transition temperature of phospholipids, intraliposomal ice formation also depended on the phase transition temperature of phospholipids. Intraliposomal ice formation was only observed for DPPC LUV but not for EPC LUV. 
 In addition to the extraliposomal ice formation, other physical changes such as the eutectic crystallization of sodium chloride (NaCl) and ice mixture on the stability of LUV were also investigated. The eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture was governed by the intra- and extraliposomal distribution of NaCl and was more likely to occur at the physiological NaCl concentrations compared to lower NaCl concentrations. The eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture further increased the leakage of LUV. 
 The understanding of the freezing behaviour and the mechanisms of freeze-injury of LUV allowed the use of the current model membranes for further investigations of the cryoprotective actions of cryoprotective agents (CPA). Partial phase diagrams of sugar-salt-water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-salt-water and ethylene glycol (EG)-salt-water systems that resembled extraliposomal solute compositions were constructed and the phase volume of ice and unfrozen matrix was estimated from the freezing curves. Ice reduction was the major mechanism by which the non-permeable and permeable CPA protected the LUV from freeze-injury. Other cryoprotective mechanisms of the non-permeable and permeable CPA through the dilution and spacing out of the LUV in the unfrozen matrix as well as the suppression of the eutectic crystallization of NaCl/ice mixture were not ruled out. Non-permeable CPA were more effective in preventing leakage of DPPC than EPC LUV. Unlike the non-permeable CPA, permeable CPA were more effective for EPC than DPPC LUV that had been subjected to freezing and thawing processes. At room temperature, however, DMSO and EG were detrimental to the stability of DPPC LUV. The choice of CPA is strictly dependent on the type of phospholipids that varied in their acyl chain length and phase transition temperature. 
 In summary, this study provides insights of the freeze-injury of LUV and the cryoprotective mechanisms of the non-permeable and permeable CPA which are beneficial to the field of cryopreservation that often depends on empirical trial and error methods. By integrating a comprehensive molecular-based understanding, an optimal cryopreservation procedure could be designed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ice</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">ice crystals</field><field name="subject">cryobiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.110706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of HIV/AIDS prevention in Nigeria : assessment and recommendations</field><field name="creator">Iyiani, Christian</field><field name="description">This is a two-stage study of HIV/AIDS prevention. In Stage One, the study examines the HIV/AIDS approach of Western aid organisations (INGOs) and compares it to the lived realities of people who are most 'at risk', sex workers, unemployed street youth, and married low income families, in the poor migrant community of Ajegunle in Nigeria&#65533;s Lagos state. The study found that INGOs and their client NGOs emphasised Western medical models of HIV/AIDS for both intervention (e.g. testing and ARV drugs for management) and prevention (e.g. through education and behaviour change). 
 In contrast, among 'at-risk' groups, the study revealed a high degree of knowledge about the transmission of HIV/AIDS (contrary to Western medical assumptions), but also detected strong feelings of powerlessness in being able to address it. INGOs and their client organisations were operating at the levels of tertiary or curative and secondary or behaviour change prevention, whereas the views of the local 'at-risk people' indicated relevance of the primary prevention level, the social structural conditions of the people. 
 In analysing the results of the first stage of the study, the findings identified a process of 'talking past each other' by official aid agencies and those most at risk, thereby inhibiting effective prevention. The INGOs and NGOs used their financial power, based on the gross inequality in the world distribution of resources, to dictate their own agendas, omitting primary intervention and instead concentrating on secondary and tertiary prevention. The study suggests that new thinking about multi-sectoral responses with full community participation is necessary in order to engage in more effective preventive action. 
 The study then sought out alternative sources of power that might permit that to happen, notably the strengths of the local Ajegunle community. As a poor community, they lacked financial resources and human capital, such as skilled workers, but they had significant knowledge capital about their own circumstances and the realities people faced. The community also had considerable cultural capital and local organisations with considerable relational capital around community links, broad based support and commitment to such action. 
 This analysis suggests the need to identify and work through the power differentials using community development processes, especially seeking to empower local communities to take part in decision-making over prevention, if effective action is to take place. The process required is one of a negotiated, inclusive partnerships for sharing information, experience, and decision-making, involving all the relevant stakeholders - the International Organisations (INGOs), National NGOs, Community Groups and the community itself.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS (disease)</field><field name="subject">Nigeria</field><field name="subject">Lagos State</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">preventive</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">services</field><field name="subject">promotion</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">humanitarian</field><field name="subject">assistance</field><field name="subject">non governmental</field><field name="subject">organizations</field><field name="subject">international</field><field name="subject">agencies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.112805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation biology of New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri)</field><field name="creator">Childerhouse, Simon</field><field name="description">New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) is a pinniped endemic to New Zealand and is among the rarest of sea lion species. New Zealand sea lions are incidentally caught in the trawl fishery for squid around the Auckland Islands, and a sea lion catch-limit or Fishing Related Mortality Limit (FRML) is used to manage this interaction. Since 2003 such limits have been calculated using an age-structured Bayesian population model. One problem with this approach is that several key demographic parameters have had to be assumed, or are based on very few data. 
 Archaeological and other historical records demonstrate that New Zealand sea lions were substantially more widespread before the arrival of humans to New Zealand than they are today (Chapter 2 published as Childerhouse &amp; Gales 1998). The present population size is clearly reduced, with subsistence and commercial hunting the most likely cause of historical changes in distribution and abundance. Campbell Island, the only significant breeding site outside the Auckland Islands, was thoroughly surveyed for New Zealand sea lions for the first time in 2003. An estimated 385 pups were born there, comprising 13% of the total pup production for the species for 2003 (Chapter 3 published as Childerhouse et al. 2005). 
 This thesis provides the first robust estimates of several demographic parameters for New Zealand sea lions. These data were gained via the capture, tagging and ageing of 865 individual females, which had come ashore to pup between 1999 and 2001. This research was underpinned by the development of a novel and robust ageing technique for live New Zealand sea lions (Chapter 5 published as Childerhouse et al. 2004). 
 Chapters 6, 7 and 8 used analyses of the age structure of these females, and of subsequent resightings of them, and of known-age females between 1998 and 2005, provided the first estimates of individual growth, mean reproductive rate (0.67, SE = 0.01), mean adult survival (0.81, SE = 0.04), and maximum age (28 years) for females. These data show that New Zealand sea lions are among the slowest growing, slowest reproducing, and longest lived sea lion species. Significant differences in the age structure of the two largest breeding colonies highlight flawed assumptions of the current management approach. The application of this new demographic information has the potential to significantly alter the existing management advice relating to the setting of FRMLs and the impact of the squid fishery on the New Zealand sea lion population. 
 Taken alone, these results suggest a dim outlook for an already threatened species. In the context that pup production is in significant decline (e.g. 32% since 1998 Chilvers et al. 2007), the species&#65533; foraging environment is thought to be marginal (Costa &amp; Gales 2000), and that resource competition may also be impacting on the population (Chapter 4 published as Childerhouse et al. 2001a), the picture darkens further. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that current management is insufficient to ensure population stasis, let alone meet the Government&#65533;s statutory goal of recovery.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sea lions</field><field name="subject">Hooker's sea lion</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">biology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080213.144055</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constituting queer : performativity and commodity culture</field><field name="creator">Brady, Anita</field><field name="description">This thesis foregrounds a question unanswered in queer theory&#65533;s account of the ongoing reproduction of heteronormativity. In Gender Trouble, Judith Butler asks "From where does the performative draw its force, and what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo" that discursively legitimated enacting? (Bodies That Matter 224-5). While queer theory offers a compelling account of how the normative fictions of identity privilege heterosexuality, the first part of Butler&#65533;s question remains relatively under-theorised. This thesis addresses this gap and argues that to understand the source of performative authority, we must address the intimate relationship between gay identity and commodity culture. Thus, I investigate the connections between the marketing industry, an historically politicised gay press, and a lesbian and gay politics imagined through the paradigm of identity, and argue that they combine in a citational feedback loop to performatively produce gay identity as the "ideal consumer." I then undertake case studies of two media texts, the website Gay.com and the television series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, in order to demonstrate how the white, male, middle-class gay aesthete functions hegemonically as gayness in culture. 
 My analysis then turns to the second part of Butler&#65533;s question -"what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo?"- and examines the consequences of the absence of an analysis of commodity culture for the notion of queer. To that end, I suggest that alongside their repetitions of gay normativity, both Gay.com and Queer Eye perform queer possibility. However, the case studies I undertake, along with the critical reception of Queer Eye and the internet technologies behind Gay.com, suggests that these media texts fall short of the promise of queerness. This apparent failure to disturb heteronormative reproduction is connected in these critiques to each text&#65533;s commercial imperatives. This thesis argues that such critiques tend to rely on determinations of the authenticity of queer performance, and emphasise veracity over queer theory&#65533;s potential to exploit the critical potential of deliberate indeterminacy. I argue, instead, that a key part of queer theory&#65533;s contingency is its capacity to respond to the changing performative contexts of the normative repetitions it seeks to undo. To put this more simply: If consumer desire defines contemporary gayness, then it is with consumer desire that queer theory must contend. It is precisely the indeterminacy of queer that enables such shifts in its strategies of subversion. Recognition of how queer&#65533;s indeterminacy enables those subversive moves returns us to the importance to queer theory of a sustained consideration of the constitutive capacities of commodity culture. What I suggest in this thesis is that if we do no ask "From where does the performance draw its force?" then we cannot answer "And what happens to the performative whose task it is to undo?" the normative framework of identity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">queer theory</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">gays</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">lesbianism</field><field name="subject">gay consumers</field><field name="subject">lesbian consumers</field><field name="subject">queer eye for the straight guy (television program)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080429.113540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sepulture perpetuelle : New Zealand and Gallipoli : possession, preservation and pilgrimage 1916-1965</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Christopher Don</field><field name="description">Constructions of memory, myth and legend relating to Gallipoli have dominated the academic assumption which suggests that this dimension alone has allowed for the reawakening of the exceptional interest in the Anzac tradition; a tradition that has converged at the physical site in modern day Turkey. While these intangible constructions have waxed, waned, and re-emerged over the Twentieth Century, possessing the site to commence the construction of an Anzac Battlefield Cemetery has been ignored in academic enquiry. This significant series of events from 1916 to 1965 were indispensable to memory perpetuation and essential to the commemorative primacy that this preserved headland now enjoys. The desire to repossess, and then own in perpetuity the battlefield in order to attach the appropriate masonry adornments, is in itself unique. This dimension has not been academically scrutinised by any historian until now. Nor has the deliberate desire to construct an Anzac shrine that would someday attract pilgrims from the Antipodes been studied. Present day site-sacralisation by rite-of-passage pilgrims, thoroughly emersed in the Anzac tradition, suggests the convergence of the two dimensions is complete. 
 To counteract this problem of the &#65533;hegemony of the intangibles&#65533; this thesis explores primary sources, gleaned largely from archival records, then evaluates the significance of the history of &#65533;physical Gallipoli.&#65533; Thematic approaches based upon the lines of possession, preservation and pilgrimage argue that this parallel dimension has played an indispensable role in shaping the end result today. Tens of thousands Australasian travellers now flock to this preserved battlefield to encounter the actual physicality of the tradition. The battlefield cemetery, complete with botanical emblems of ownership, had been out of the reach of the very generation who had created, acquired and constructed the battlefield landscape. The New Zealand public had to be content with assorted forms of vicarious pilgrimage coupled with widespread domestic memorialisation. 
 New Zealand&#65533;s post-evacuation experience at Gallipoli became a story completely distinctive from that of Australia or Great Britain. The deliberately constructed Anzac Battlefield Cemetery is a unique landscape artefact that a proud but mournful generation set out to create. They eventually achieved this end by a complicated mixture of conquest, occupation, careful preservation, and commemorative ownership. These efforts were assisted by the vagaries of economic happenstance and international politics that left this remote Peninsula isolated and off-limits to human encounter. Fortuitously frozen in time, this landscape artefact, so steeped in Classical history, has emerged as one of the most sacred, and perhaps the most recognisable, geographic features associated with Australasia. Overriding these plans for shrine construction had been the stated goal of securing a reverent final resting place for those who fell during the creation of the Anzac legend in 1915. Sepulture perpetuelle became the post-evacuation catchphrase that propelled this Great War generation to go almost to the brink of war to secure the principles of this phrase. This lofty goal of permanence, by passage of time and the re-appropriation of nature, had mercifully been completed before the current &#65533;second invasion&#65533; that commenced in the 1980s.

It recognises that not enough is yet known about the discourses and agency which influence their lives. Consequently, this study has sought to establish what dominant discourses shape the lives of farm women, their responses to these discourses and how their discursive positioning influences their agency. 
 This study employed a qualitative case study approach involving interviews with a diverse mixture of independent farm women, along with women farming in marital relationships. This thesis engages these narratives to showcase the colourful, complex life-experiences of farm women. In addition, and where present, women&#65533;s partners were interviewed to provide male farmers&#65533; perspectives about women in family farming. 
 This research has found that women&#65533;s lives are shaped by positioning and contextualising discourses, with which they comply to ensure that the family farm survives. Their subservient discursive positioning limits the agency they can express, although they are able to mobilise indirect agency through supporting their partner; an implicit form of agency which has previously been unrecognised or understated. 
 Cumulatively, this thesis highlights the need to recognise the diversity of farm women, and how they are able to exercise agency from their constrained subject positions within the family farming context. Furthermore it emphasises that agency is a dynamic, and far more varied concept than previously understood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">farmers</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">farms</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071127.160311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translational control mechanisms used by the human Hepatitis B virus : an upstream open reading frame modulates expression of the pregenomic RNA</field><field name="creator">Chen, Augustine</field><field name="description">The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small hepatotropic virus, which affects approximately 350 million chronic sufferers worldwide. It has a compact 3.2 kbp dsDNA genome encoding four major overlapping genes namely core, polymerase, surface and X required for its replication. The virus synthesises a pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) which functions both as an RNA intermediate for reverse transcription into the DNA genome and as the mRNA for the translation of the core (C) and polymerase (P) proteins. The core overlaps the polymerase gene and is translated at a 10 to 1 ratio. The polymerase gene translated from the P AUG codon is preceded by at least 4 upstream AUG codons (uAUGs), namely C AUG, C1 AUG, J AUG and C2 AUG. Various mechanisms have been implicated in the synthesis of the polymerase protein. This led to the currently accepted model which involves leaky scanning and a reinitiation mechanism in polymerase synthesis. 
 However, multiple sequence alignment of the pgRNA revealed a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) highly conserved at the nucleotide level in all HBV subtypes and mammalian hepadnaviruses. This previously unreported uORF, designated as C0 ORF in this study is also conserved in its position and length. Past studies have either omitted this uORF in their test constructs or ignored its potential role. The C0 ORF has a conserved weak initiation context and is located within the epsilon structure within the 5&#65533; leader of the pgRNA, required for viral encapsidation. Importantly, the C0 ORF precedes and overlaps the core ORF, which may suggest an alternative model in which the core and polymerase may be translated and coordinately regulated. 
 Fusion of the C0 ORF to luciferase showed for the first time that this uORF is translated through the detection of reporter activity (~20% of C) and also visualisation of the fusion protein via western analysis using anti-C0 and anti-luciferase antibodies. Subsequent removal of the C0 ORF implicated a role in repressing downstream core fusion protein synthesis in HepG2 cells. A similar repression was observed on J expression. 
 To study the effect of C0 on downstream polymerase translation, a pgRNA-like DNA construct was made and subsequent mutations introduced. Mutation of the C0 AUG led to an increase in initiation at the downstream P AUG. Alteration of the existing weak initiation context to an optimal context which favours stronger initiation consistently showed a potential role for C0 ORF in facilitating reinitiation at certain downstream initiation codons including P AUG. Mutations of other uAUGs preceding the P AUG were also done to better understand their roles in regulating polymerase synthesis. The removal of the C AUG markedly increased expression from the P AUG. This study revealed other internal uAUGs in-frame to the C AUG, namely the C1 and C2 AUGs are also effectively translated, further reducing availability of translating ribosomes to downstream P AUG. Indeed the removal of the C1 and C2 AUGs led to a corresponding increase in initiation from the P AUG. Initiation at the internal J AUG was also reported and its removal showed a significant decrease in expression from the P AUG, consistent with the previous model implicating reinitiation at the P initiation site after translation of the short J ORF. The inhibitory role of the 5 uAUGs prior to the P AUG were confirmed when all were removed, giving rise to translation almost equal to that at C AUG. 
 Taken together, these results suggest a new model in which the HBV C0 ORF plays a key role in controlling core and polymerase synthesis by repressing core translation and making available more ribosomes to downstream AUGs possibly facilitating translation reinitiation. In addition, the translation of the C0 ORF across the [epsilon] region may also preclude encapsidation, potentially acting as a switch discriminating the pgRNA template between encapsidation and translation. Therefore, the highly conserved [epsilon] region and C0 ORF present an excellent target for molecular based antiviral drugs (antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, ribozymes) potentially providing new anti HBV drugs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">RNA</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.123043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induction and decay of heat acclimation</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Andrew</field><field name="description">Most advice for improving physiological strain in the heat includes maintaining hydration using long-term acclimation protocols (&gt;10 days). Therefore, the major aims of this thesis were to examine; (i) effectiveness of short term (5-day) heat acclimation (STHA) with moderately and highly trained athletes; (ii) fluid regulatory strain has a thermally-independent role in heat adaptation; and, (iii) impact of STHA on a marker of thermotolerance&#768; (inducible heat shock protein 70; HSP70). 
 Ten moderately trained males completed heat acclimation (Acc) under controlled hyperthermia (rectal temperature 38.5&#65533;C) for 90-min on five consecutive days (T[a] = 40&#65533;C, 60% RH), on two occasions separated by a five-week washout, in a cross-over design. One Acc was undertaken with euhydration (fluid replenishment; EUH) and one with dehydration (no fluid intake; DEH) during daily Acc bouts. Participants completed an exercising heat stress test (HST) one week before, then on the 2nd day after Acc for both regimes. HST involved cycling at 40% PPO for 90 min (T[a] = 35&#65533;C, 60% RH), 10 min rest and a ramp protocol (2% PPO each 30 s) to volitional fatigue. HSTs were further completed 1, 2, and 3 wks after Acc to track the acclimation decay. On a later occasion eight highly trained male rowers were heat acclimated under the same protocol but with DEH acclimation only and a rowing-specific HST (2000 m rowing performance test). Plasma volume (PV) at rest and cardiac output (Q&#775;) during HSTs were measured using CO and CO&#8322; rebreathing, respectively. A number of plasma constituents were measured: PV, AVP, aldosterone, HSP70, total protein, albumin, Na&#8314;, K&#8314;, Cl&#8315; and osmolality. 
 Short term heat acclimation resulted in physiological adaptation and enhanced exercise capacity for moderately trained participants. Compared to EUH permissive DEH during Acc bouts conferred larger acclimation-induced increases in resting PV by 4.1% (95%CI: -1.5 to 9.8%; p=0.06), Q&#775;[F]. (4.2: 0.7 to 7.8 mlmin&#8315;&#65533; 100 ml&#8315;&#65533;; p0.009), FVC (0.06: 0.02 to 0.10 ml 100ml Tissue&#8315;&#65533;mmHg&#8315;&#65533;; p=0.006), end-exercise V[s] (45.9: 3.6 to 84.4 mL; p=0.02) and decreased end-exercise f[c] by 17% (19: -29 to 9 b&#65533;min&#8315;&#65533;; p=0.08). Cardiovascular adaptations except PV persisted for one wk, but not two wks after Acc indicating that cardiovascular-related benefits from STHA may not be mediated by hypervolaemic responses per se. The highly trained athletes had functional heat adaptations of similar magnitude to lesser fitness-adapted participants across DEH acclimation, including resting PV expansion (4.5: 0.7 to 8.3%) and increased performance (-4.0: -6.3 to 0.6[s]; p=0.02). Plasma total protein-corrected HSP70 concentration increased from rest to end-exercise across acclimation (p=0.001). There was a greater change from rest to end-exercise on day one versus day five Acc (p=0.05), indicating a reduced stress-induced increase and a protective adaptive change. There were weak to moderate relationships between hydration indices in dynamic circumstances indicating that there is no single measure to accurately assess hydration status. 
 In conclusion, short-term (5-day) heat acclimation was effective with adaptations more pronounced after fluid regulatory strain from a dehydration acclimation regime. Similar findings were found using highly trained and lesser- fitness adapted participants. Thermotolerance was increased by dehydration acclimation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heat adaptation</field><field name="subject">acclimatization</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071019.140025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical investigations of mitochondria</field><field name="creator">Adlam, Victoria Jean</field><field name="description">The production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria results in mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress. Because mitochondria play such a crucial role in cell function through the production of energy and the regulation of apoptosis this mitochondrial damage can lead to cellular dysfunction and ultimately to the pathophysiology of many diseases. 
 A series of mitochondria-targeted derivatives of vitamin E (MitoE) have been synthesised. The synthesis begins from readily available starting materials and can be systematically varied to create a MitoE analogue of desired lipophilicity. The syntheses of MitoE&#8322;, MitoE&#8324;, MitoE&#8326;, MitoE&#8321;&#8320; and MitoE&#8321;&#8321; have been completed and are reported herein. MitoE&#8322; and MitoE&#8321;&#8320; have been assessed for antioxidant efficacy and they are significantly more potent than untargeted vitamin E analogues. 
 Modification of the phenolic functionality of vitamin E causes significant perturbation to its biological activity. Substitution at this position with a succinoyl ester results in potent pro-apoptotic activity and selective toxicity to malignant cells. A mitochondria-targeted analogue of vitamin E succinate (MitoE succinate) has been synthesised by reaction of MitoE&#8321;&#8321; with succinic anhydride. This compound is a particularly potent inducer of apoptosis in malignant cells and is non-toxic to non-malignant cells. 
 MitoQ&#8321;&#8320; is well established as a potent mitochondria-targeted antioxidant in vitro, however in vivo results are limited. In this study MitoQ&#8321;&#8320; was examined in an ex vivo cardiac model of ischemia-reperfusion injury. It was found to be significantly more effective than untargeted antioxidants at reducing cardiac and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as tissue damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion. 
 Because mitochondria play a key role in a wide range of pathologies, imaging mitochondrial function in vivo would have great diagnostic value. A series of fluorine containing phosphonium salts have been synthesised these compounds have potential applications in &#65533;&#8313;F MRI imaging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mitochondria</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.144622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of a disaster destination : rebuilding Koh Phi Phi, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Leopold, Teresa Ingeborg</field><field name="description">The popular tourist destination island of Koh Phi Phi Don, Thailand was heavily affected by the Indian Ocean Tsunami in December 2004, which resulted in a destroyed tourism infrastructure and complete downturn of tourism. Extensive recovery and rebuilding work by emerging community groups, returned locals, international volunteers and Thai government units provided an efficient but hasty reconstruction of the destination. Ethnographic research conducted in the community provided insights into the complex stakeholder interactions and their roles and influences on the reconstruction of the community. 
 The community&#65533;s level of vulnerability on Koh Phi Phi Don was influenced by social processes and interactions during the destination&#65533;s recovery process as the various stakeholders (e.g. government vs. locals) had differing perceptions of the island&#65533;s economic, environmental and social vulnerability. These disputes are grounded in different social time processes, particularly illustrated through land law disputes among locals, landowners and the government. Other factors which influenced the reconstruction of Koh Phi Phi as a tourist destination were pre-tsunami conditions (past overdevelopment), the empowerment of the community, the reconstructed place identity, various anniversary celebrations and the early warning system. 
 A model is suggested to illustrate and discuss Koh Phi Phi Don as a disaster destination, which provides insights into the dynamics which govern a destination&#65533;s post-disaster recovery period. Thus, it illustrates how stakeholder interaction is influenced by distinct understandings of the multiple notions of vulnerability. Furthermore, this study establishes essential links between disaster and tourism theories and suggests an extended tourism disaster management framework, which calls for an inclusion of post-recovery processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Koh Phi Phi</field><field name="subject">disasters</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080430.100246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of cobalt(III) complexes containing tripodal tetraamine ligands</field><field name="creator">McClintock, Lisa F</field><field name="description">The new Co(III) carbonate complexes [Co(uns-penp)(O&#8322;CO)]ClO&#8324;&#65533;H&#8322;O and [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)]ClO&#8324;, containing tripodal tetraamine ligands, have been synthesised and characterised by microanalysis, &#65533;H, &#65533;&#65533;C and &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR, mass spectrometry (MS) and UV-vis spectroscopy. In addition, the &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR spectra have been obtained for two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes containing aliphatic (N&#8324; = tren, baep, abap, trpn) and pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, pmea, pmap, tepa) tripodal tetraamine ligands and the complex [Co(dppa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;. The &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR signal increases as [Delta] decreases, indicating there is less electron density at the Co(III) nucleus as the metal-ligand orbital overlap becomes poorer. A linear relationship was found to exist between the [Delta] for the individual complexes and their &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR chemical shifts which follows the relationship: [Delta] = 29 174 + -0.89363 x [delta](&#8309;&#8313;Co) 
 For the two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]+ complexes, plots of the magnetogyric ratio (&#947;) and [lambda][max] have y-intercepts that do not accurately correspond to the magnetogyric ratio of the bare cobalt nucleus (&#947;&#8320;(Co)). This is due to the deviation of the complexes from pure octahedral symmetry. A fluxional process in the complex [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; was investigated using variable temperate (VT) NMR. This was found to involve the inversion of a six-membered chelate ring about a pseudo mirror plane with a [Delta]G[double dagger] of 58 kJ mol&#8315;&#65533; at 25 &#65533;C. Mass spectra have been obtained for all the [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes, and these show a common fragmentation pattern for all the complexes except [Co(trpn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, where CO&#8322; is lost from the molecular ion to give a [Co(N&#8324;)O]&#8314; adduct.

The first and second processes were thought to be [H&#8323;O&#8314;] dependent, while the third was fit to a first order exponential decay and was [H&#8323;O&#8314;] independent (k[obs] ~ 4.2 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(baep)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, 3.8 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(abap)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; and 3.5 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(trpn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;). However, none of the processes could be confidently assigned to a step in the acid hydrolysis mechanism. The data obtained from the studies of [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; and [Co(Me&#8323;-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; showed a single first order [H&#8323;O&#8314;] dependent process which was fit to the following expression: k[obs] = (k&#8321;K[H&#8323;O]&#8314;)/(1 + K[H&#8323;O]&#8314; 
 This gave k&#8321; = 5.8 x 10&#8315;&#8308; &#65533; 2.3 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533; and K = 0.13 &#65533; 0.06 L mol&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; at 25 &#65533;C and k&#8321; = 6.0 x 10&#8315;&#8309; &#65533; 2.0 x 10&#8315;&#8310; s&#8315;&#65533; and K = 0.38 &#65533; 0.02 L mol&#8315;&#65533; for [Co(Me&#8323;-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; at 50 &#65533;C. Both values of K indicate that protonation of chelated carbonate is far from complete at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 1.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533;. Comparative rates of acid hydrolysis at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 6.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533; were obtained for the complexes [Co(tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.79 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C), [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.8 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C), [Co(pmap)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.5 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 50 &#65533;C), [Co(tepa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 4.3 x 10&#8315;&#8309; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C) and [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 1.3 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533;, 50 &#65533;C) and at [H&#8323;O&#8314;] = 1.0 mol L&#8315;&#65533; for the complexes [Co(uns-penp)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.9 x 10&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C) and [Co(dppa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; (k[obs] = 2.7 x 10&#8315;&#8308; s&#8315;&#65533;, 25 &#65533;C). The vast differences in the rates of acid hydrolysis can be rationalised on a steric basis. Bulkier ancillary ligands impede the direct protonation of an endo oxygen atom, or the transfer of a proton from the exo to an endo oxygen atom.

In addition, the X-ray crystal structures of the complexes [Co(trpyn)(O&#8322;CO)](Zn(OH)&#8322;Cl&#8323;)&#65533;4H&#8322;O (triclinic, P-1, a = 7.4962(7) A&#778;, b = 13.4019(11) A&#778;, c = 13.6887(11) A&#778;, &#945; = 74.631(4)&#65533;, &#946; = 82.893(4)&#65533;, &#947; = 82.324(4)&#65533;, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0268, wR2 = 0.0638) and [Co(tepa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8322;(ZnCl&#8324;)&#65533;3H&#8322;O (triclinic, P-1, a = 9.9250(10) A&#778;, b = 15.5561(13) A&#778;, c = 15.8730(16) A&#778;, &#945; = 89.545(4)&#65533;, &#946; = 85.019(5)&#65533;, &#947; = 72.714(4)&#65533;, Z = 2, R1 = 0.0291, wR2 = 0.0722) were obtained. These two complexes were synthesised under analogous conditions to the bi- and trimetallic complexes. However, in these cases metallation of chelated carbonate did not occur. 
 DFT calculations have been used to calculate the relative energies of pairs of geometric isomers of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes (N&#8324; = baep, abap, pmea, pmap, dppa, Me-tpa, Me&#8322;-tpa). In all cases, except that of [Co(Me-tpa)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, the calculations correctly predict that the experimentally observed isomer is lower in energy. An electronic study on two series of [Co(N&#8324;)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314; complexes containing pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, pmea, pmap, tepa) and Me-pyridyl (N&#8324; = tpa, Me-tpa, Me&#8322;-tpa, Me&#8323;-tpa) tripodal tetraamine ligands correctly reproduces the observed trends in &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR chemical shift and [Delta] values. A molecular orbital analysis of the two series of complexes shows that there is no significant difference between the highest energy occupied orbitals with the largest contribution from the coordinated oxygen atoms. Bond decomposition analyses of the two series of complexes indicate that there is also no difference in total bond energies. These results indicate that there is no electronic explanation for the large differences in reactivity towards acid that is observed experimentally. 
 The first mononuclear complex containing chelated hydrogen phosphate, [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;PO&#8322;H)]ClO&#8324;, has been synthesised and characterised using microanalysis, &#65533;H, &#65533;&#65533;C, &#65533;&#65533;P and &#8309;&#8313;Co NMR, UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography (monoclinic, P2&#8321;/c, a = 8.7017(17) A&#778;, b = 27.639(5) A&#778;, c = 9.586(2) A&#778;, &#946; = 112.818(9)&#65533;, &#945; = &#947; = 90&#65533;, Z = 4, R1 = 0.0443, wR2 = 0.1076). The X-ray crystal structure of [Co(pmeaH)(OH&#8322;)Cl&#8322;](CoCl&#8324;)&#65533;H&#8322;O (orthorhombic, P2&#8321;2&#8321;2&#8321;, a = 12.6354(3) A&#778;, b = 12.6354(3) A&#778;, c = 15.8261(11) A&#778;, &#945; = &#946; = &#947; = 90&#65533;, Z = 4, R1 = 0.0397, wR2 = 0.0954), in which the pmea ligand is coordinated in a hypodentate fashion, was also obtained. [Co(pmeaH)(OH&#8322;)Cl&#8322;](CoCl&#8324;)&#65533;H&#8322;O is thought to be an impurity in crude samples of [Co(pmea)Cl&#8322;]Cl. The pK[a] of [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;PO&#8322;H)]&#8314; was determined to be 4.99 &#65533; 0.02 by potentiometric titration. A ring inversion fluxional process, analogous to that observed for [Co(pmea)(O&#8322;CO)]&#8314;, was found by VT-NMR to have a [Delta]G[double dagger] of 60 kJ mol&#8315;&#65533; at 35 &#65533;C. A &#65533;&#65533;P NMR spectrum, taken after the solution was left standing for approximately three hours, showed evidence of cleavage of the hydrogen phosphate chelate via a bimetallic hydrolysis mechanism. Attempts were also made to synthesise Co(III) complexes containing chelated phosphate ester ligands (monomethyl phosphate and monophenyl phosphate), with pmea as the ancillary ligand. &#65533;&#65533;P NMR spectra of the crude samples indicate that the monomethyl phosphate moiety is chelated to Co(III) (&#65533;&#65533;P [delta] = 21.05 ppm). However, it is unclear whether the monophenyl phosphate is chelated or bridging between two Co(III) ions (&#65533;&#65533;P [delta] = 14.36 ppm).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cobalt</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080505.142115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalization and the state : towards a neo-medieval political order?</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Stephen Paul</field><field name="description">The system of states that now covers the planet did not arise out of thin air; rather it was the product of historical forces that gradually coalesced around the state form. But the dynamics of that process no longer obtain. In their place, a new, highly complex amalgam of material and ideational forces is now in the ascendant -- and its arrival has serious implications for traditionally configured, "Westphalian" states. 
 Understood as ("thick") globalization, this interlocking array of political, economic, social and cultural forces challenges the old order at two key points. First, traditional states had "hard shells," by means of which they were capable of consolidating differences between &#65533;inside&#65533; and &#65533;outside&#65533; to the point where the latter could more easily be quarantined. Second, for closely related reasons they were largely able to "absorb" domestic society, such that the individual was less a citizen than (s)he was a subject. But these (dubious) capabilities have been severely exposed and eroded, which leads us to ask, "Whither the state under globalization?" My thesis constitutes a sustained attempt to answer this question. 
 The theme is a large one - and I believe that to be adequately treated, large themes require a varied approach. First, in terms of theory this means that I borrow from a significant diversity of recognized &#65533;Schools&#65533; within the discipline of International Relations. Second, in terms of method I follow a similarly pluralist line. Broadly speaking, the work is interpretive as opposed to explanatory, which is to concede that one cannot be &#65533;purely&#65533; scientific while standing inside the phenomena one wishes to examine. On the other hand, this forecloses neither the scientific method nor its guiding spirit. With respect to states and the international system, we can still be "scientific realists:" states are real structures whose nature can legitimately be approximated through sciences. In sum, I cleave to a sort of methodological middle ground between science and interpretation, taking from each in the measure that they advance the discussion. Third, in terms of normative intent my chief concern is with the way things are; but as it turns out, the way things are increasingly includes the way they ought to be. In other words, the ontology of our globalizing world is increasingly deontological in texture. 
 This may sound contradictory. Nevertheless, the spread of universal norms - and of equally universal ordering principles, or patterns of global organization - has undeniable repercussions for the relationship between is and ought. In turn, the implications for states are profound. The answer to my central question, "Wither the state under globalization?" is this: we are now on the threshold of a neo-medieval era of segmented political authority. Centrally nested within this new order is the embedded cosmopolitan state, wherein universal and particular aspects of being can now be fully reconciled.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">medievalism</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="subject">nation-state</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">internationalism</field><field name="subject">international organisation</field><field name="subject">sovereignty</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080514.111752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood, sweat and queers : (re)imagining global queer citizenship at the Sydney 2002 Gay Games</field><field name="creator">Burns, Kellie Jean</field><field name="description">This thesis takes the Sydney 2002 Gay Games: Under New Skies &#65533;02, as a case study into the production of global queer citizenship. In the existing body of work around the Gay Games they are analysed as an international gay and lesbian sporting event (Cramer, 1996; Krane et al., 2001; Pronger, 2000; Waitt, 2005), as a gay and lesbian community event (Krane &amp; Waldron, 2000; Symons, 2002, 2004; Waitt, 2003, 2006), and as a cultural site where discourses of nationality, sport and sexuality converge (Miller, 2001; Probyn, 2000; Rowe et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2005; Waitt, 2005; Waitt &amp; Markwell, 2006). This thesis builds on these investigations, asking specific questions about the ways in which discourses of sexuality and citizenship are produced and governed within and across the Sydney 2002 Gay Games promotional and media materials. The analysis is guided by Michel Foucault&#65533;s notion of governmentality (1991) and the works of related theorists who map the disparate array of neoliberal mechanisms of government that &#65533;conduct the conduct&#65533; and &#65533;act on the actions&#65533; of individuals and certain populations (Bratich et al., 2003; Gordon, 1991; Larner, 2000; Larner &amp; Walters, 2002, 2004; Miller, 1993; Rabinow &amp; Rose, 2003; Rose, 1996a, 1999). The analysis begins by asking how discourses of the autonomous, neo-liberal subject converge with discourses of &#65533;global living&#65533; such that individuals are invited to imagine themselves as increasingly flexible, freedom-loving (Rose, 1999), self-assured, cosmopolitan global citizens. The idea of the global imagination is then used to explore the ways in which the Gay Games commitment to &#65533;total inclusion&#65533; and its promise of personal and community transformation rely on similar neo-liberal renderings of tbe subject. It argues that the event&#65533;s &#65533;political&#65533; promises not only normalise certain forms of identity-based consumption (Chasin, 2000), they also (re)produce and normalise a very entrepreneurial, western-centric, cosmopolitan &#65533;brand&#65533; of global queer citizenship. The thesis also emphasises the important role that images and image-related technologies played in upholding normative meanings around queer sexuality and queer citizenship at the Games. In doing so, the thesis argues that images and technologies do more than simply represent individuals&#65533; lived experiences. Images, it argues, are (inter)active entities that produce and shape individuals&#65533; understanding of the &#65533;real&#65533; and how they come to know themselves as certain types of subjects. Where the Sydney 2002 Gay Games were concerned, images were integral in producing normative meanings around gender, sexuality and citizenship and in governing participants&#65533; experiences as &#65533;locals&#65533;, &#65533;global visitors&#65533;, &#65533;athletes&#65533;, &#65533;cultural participants&#65533; and consumers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gay Games (6th : 2002 : Sydney</field><field name="subject">N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">sports</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">gay athletes</field><field name="subject">lesbian athletes</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080514.131842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connectionist-Based Intelligent Information Systems for image analysis and knowledge engineering : applications in horticulture</field><field name="creator">Woodford, Brendon James</field><field name="description">New Zealand&#65533;s main export earnings come from the primary production area including agriculture, horticulture, and viticulture. One of the major contributors in this area of horticulture is the production of quality export grade fruit; specifically apples. In order to maintain a competitive advantage, the systems and methods used to grow the fruit are constantly being refined and are increasingly based on data collected and analysed by both the orchardist who grows the produce and also researchers who refine the methods used to determine high levels of fruit quality. 
 To support the task of data analysis and the resulting decision-making process it requires efficient and reliable tools. This thesis attempts to address this issue by applying the techniques of Connectionist-Based Intelligent Information Systems (CBIIS) for Image Analysis and Knowledge Discovery. Using advanced neurocomputing techniques and a novel knowledge engineering methodology, this thesis attempts to seek some solutions to a set of specific problems that exist within the horticultural domain. 
 In particular it describes a methodology based on previous research into neuro-fuzzy systems for knowledge acquisition, manipulation, and extraction and furthers this area by introducing a novel and innovative knowledge-based architecture for knowledge-discovery using an on-line/real-time incremental learning system based on the Evolving Connectionist System (ECOS) paradigm known as the Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network (EFuNN). 
 The emphases of this work highlights knowledge discovery from these data sets using a novel rule insertion and rule extraction method. The advantage of this method is that it can operate on data sets of limited sizes. This method can be used to validate the results produced by the EFuNN and also allow for greater insight into what aspects of the collected data contribute to the development of high quality produce.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">expert systems (computer science)</field><field name="subject">horticulture</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080515.111549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative and qualitative study of early childhood caries among young children in the Emirate of Ajman, United Arab Emirates</field><field name="creator">Hashim, Raghad</field><field name="description">Objectives: The objective of the quantitative research was to estimate the prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) and severe Early Childhood Caries (s-ECC) and the severity of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) in the primary dentition of young children in Ajman, UAE, and investigate their association with child and family characteristics, dietary habits, fluoride use, oral hygiene practices and dental services utilization. The purpose of the qualitative research was to obtain information that could explain some of the findings of the quantitative stage in order to progress towards determining a strategy to control ECC in this population. 
 Methods: A two-stage cluster sample was used to randomly select children aged 5 or 6 years old who were enrolled in public or private schools in Ajman, UAE. Clinical examinations for caries were conducted by a single examiner using WHO criteria. Parents completed questionnaires seeking information on child and family characteristics, dietary habits, oral hygiene, fluoride use and dental service utilization. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify risk markers and risk indicators for caries experience. To complement the quantitative findings, the second (qualitative) stage of the research was conducted with six chosen groups of mothers from different educational backgrounds and different nationalities. Each group contained between six and ten mothers - some of whose children had been examined in the quantitative section of the project. The mothers were invited to comment on the significance for them of those risk indicators identified in the earlier section of the research. The manual thematic coding method of analysis was used. Problems concerning the dental health of children were identified based on the results of both stages. 
 Results: The total number of children sampled was 1297. Dental examination and questionnaire data were obtained for 1036 (79.9%), of whom 50.0% were female. The prevalence of ECC in 5- and 6-year-old children was 72.9% (95% CI, 61.8, 83.9) and 80.0% (95% CI, 76.0, 84.4) respectively, with mean dmft scores of 4.0 (sd, 4.1) and 4.9 (sd, 4.3) respectively (P&lt;0.05). The overall prevalence of s-ECC was 31.1% (95% CI, 23.6, 38.9). Multivariate analysis indicated that frequency of snacking between meals per day, snack consumption level and the frequency of brushing had a significant effect on the severity of ECC, while only the snack consumption level and the frequency of brushing had a significant effect on plaque score. There was a strong association between plaque score and the severity of ECC. The total number of mothers who contributed to the qualitative study was 42. The findings of the qualitative stage showed that some mothers had a negative perception toward the primary dentition and unhelpful attitudes towards their children&#65533;s diets (through promoting a high consumption of cariogenic food), while the use of fluoride (other than in toothpaste) was rare. However, many mothers were in favor of bottled water fluoridation once they understood the benefits of such a scheme and supported the idea of a dental preventive program beng provided through their children&#65533;s schools. 
 Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of ECC in young children in Ajman is high, with child and family characteristics, dietary habits, oral hygiene practices and dental utilization being important determinants. Young children in Ajman would benefit from health promotion strategies directed towards appropriate dietary practices and oral hygiene measures framed within culturally specific guidelines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental caries in children</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="subject">child health services</field><field name="subject">mouth</field><field name="subject">care and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Ajman</field><field name="subject">United Arab Emirates</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080521.144521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the roles of the PsbL, PsbM, PsbT and Psb27 subunits of Photosystem II in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803</field><field name="creator">Bentley, Fiona K</field><field name="description">The PsbL, PsbM and PsbT subunits of photosystem II (PSII) are single-helix membrane-spanning proteins found at the monomer-monomer interface that may stabilize the dimeric complex. This study has characterised strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 where psbL, psbM and psbT have been interrupted by the insertion of antibiotic-resistance cassettes. The [Delta]PsbL strain exhibited slowed growth that correlated with a disruption in PSII assembly leading to an accumulation of CP43-less PSII monomers. Moreover, the [Delta]PsbL:[Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbL:[Delta]PsbT double mutants were not photoautotrophic. In contrast, the [Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbT strains grew photoautotrophically and supported oxygen evolution, albeit at reduced rates compared to wild type. S-state analyses showed that the removal of PsbM or PsbT did not affect the donor side reactions of PSII, which includes the oxidation of water, however, the removal of PsbT impaired electron flow between Q[A] and Q[B] on the acceptor side of PSII. Blue-Native PAGE revealed that removal of either PsbM or PsbT was insufficient to entirely disrupt dimer formation; however, the combined removal of PsbM and PsbT resulted in the predominance of monomeric forms of PSII in the [Delta]PsbM:[Delta]PsbT strain. Under high light (2 mE m&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533; at 30&#65533;C), [Delta]PsbM and [Delta]PsbT cells were considerably more susceptible to photoinactivation than wild type; however, they were able to fully recover in a protein synthesis-dependent manner when returned to moderate light levels (0.03 mE m&#8315;&#65533; s&#8315;&#65533;). A requirement for Psb27 was found in the protein-synthesis-dependent recovery of photoinactivated [Delta]PsbT cells. More significantly, an absolute functional requirement was found for Psb27 in the [Delta]PsbM strain, where functional PSII complexes are not assembled in the absence of Psb27. These results suggest that Psb27 is critical for PSII assembly in the absence of PsbM, and also for the protein-synthesis-dependent recovery of PSII in the absence of PsbT. Moreover, in addition to Psb27, the PsbU subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex was also found to be an absolute functional requirement in the [Delta]PsbM strain, where functional PSII centres are not assembled when both PsbM and PsbU are absent. It appears, therefore, that PsbM has crucial functional interactions with specific extrinsic proteins located in the vicinity of the oxygen-evolving complex. Interestingly, the [Delta]PsbM strain was also found to have a high susceptibility to suppressor mutations, indicating it has important functional roles in the cyanobacterial cell.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photosynthetic bacteria</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080627.151048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Belonging knows no boundaries : persisting land tenure custom for Shona, Ndebele and Ngai Tahu</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, David Pell</field><field name="description">Aspects of customary land tenure may survive even where formal rules in a society supersede custom. This thesis is about persisting custom for Maori Freehold land (MFL) in New Zealand, and the Communal Areas (CAs) of Zimbabwe. Three questions are addressed: what unwritten land tenure custom still persists for Ngai Tahu, Shona and Ndebele, what key historical processes and events in New Zealand and Zimbabwe shaped the relationship between people and land into the form it displays today, and how do we explain differences between surviving customary tenure practices in the two countries? The research was based on in-depth interviews. 
 A key difference between the two countries was found to lie in the type and degree of security available over the years to Maori and Shona/Ndebele. Roots of security were found in the substance of the founding treaties and concessions, and thereafter in a variety of other factors including the help (or lack of it) offered by the law in redressing grievances, the level of intermarriage between settler and autochthon, the differing security of land rights offered in urban centres in the respective countries, demographic factors and the availability of state benefits. This research finds that greater security was offered to Maori than to Shona and Ndebele, and that this has reduced the centrality of customary practices with regard to land. 
 The research found that, in Zimbabwe, tenure security in the CAs is still underwritten by communities and that significant investment is still made in both living and dead members of those communities. Another finding is that land custom has adapted dynamically to meet new challenges, such as urban land and CA land sales. In New Zealand, investment in groups that jointly hold rights in MFL has, to some extent been eclipsed by the payment of rates and the availability of services (e.g. state-maintained boundary records and law enforcement mechanisms) and of benefits (e.g. superannuation, disability and unemployment). Land and community are not as closely linked to survival as they were in the past and, for many, they have come to hold largely symbolic value and less practical significance. Overall, it is the pursuit of security and &#65533;belonging&#65533; that have been the greatest influences on customary land tenure practices in the long term.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shona (African people)</field><field name="subject">Ndebele (African people)</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">Ngai Tahu (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="subject">customary law</field><field name="subject">Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080807.151921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation of Alexander&#65533;s court : the kingship, royal insignia and eastern court personnel of Alexander the Great</field><field name="creator">Collins, Andrew William</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Alexander&#65533;s conception of kingship, his relationship with royal traditions in the three great kingdoms of the Near East, and the concomitant transformation of the king&#65533;s court by which Alexander created a distinctive royal insignia and introduced new court personnel and protocol. Section I ("Alexander and Near Eastern Kingship") contains Chapters I, II, and III. Section II ("The Transformation") comprises Chapters IV to VI. In Chapter I, I examine the Macedonian background of Alexander&#65533;s court and his native conception of kingship. Chapter II is a study of the kingship of Egypt. Chapter III deals with the kingship of Babylon and Persia. I then turn to an analysis of Alexander&#65533;s policies towards the Persians and the concept of the "kingship of Asia," as this was understood by Alexander. This crucial concept is to be distinguished from the kingship of Persia, a position which Alexander supplanted and replaced with his personal kingship of Asia. In Section II, three chapters are devoted to an analysis of the transformation of Alexander&#65533;s court. Chapter IV covers the origin and significance of Alexander&#65533;s royal insignia. Chapter V examines the introduction of, and the role played by, Persians and easterners in the king&#65533;s court; and Chapter VI the significance of other Persian court offices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.)</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">Macedonian Expansion 359-323 B.C.</field><field name="subject">regalia (insignia)</field><field name="subject">ancient kings and rulers</field><field name="subject">courts and courtiers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080811.093142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatially-structured niching methods for evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="creator">Dick, Grant</field><field name="description">Traditionally, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) operates on a single population with no restrictions on possible mating pairs. Interesting changes to the behaviour of EAs emerge when the structure of the population is altered so that mating between individuals is restricted. Variants of EAs that use such populations are grouped into the field of spatially-structured EAs (SSEAs). 
 Previous research into the behaviour of SSEAs has primarily focused on the impact space has on the selection pressure in the system. Selection pressure is usually characterised by takeover times and the ratio between the neighbourhood size and the overall dimension of space. While this research has given indications into where and when the use of an SSEA might be suitable, it does not provide a complete coverage of system behaviour in SSEAs. This thesis presents new research into areas of SSEA behaviour that have been left either unexplored or briefly touched upon in current EA literature. 
 The behaviour of genetic drift in finite panmictic populations is well understood. This thesis attempts to characterise the behaviour of genetic drift in spatially-structured populations. First, an empirical investigation into genetic drift in two commonly encountered topologies, rings and torii, is performed. An observation is made that genetic drift in these two configurations of space is independent of the genetic structure of individuals and additive of the equivalent-sized panmictic population. In addition, localised areas of homogeneity present themselves within the structure purely as a result of drifting. A model based on the theory of random walks to absorbing boundaries is presented which accurately characterises the time to fixation through random genetic drift in ring topologies. 
 A large volume of research has gone into developing niching methods for solving multimodal problems. Previously, these techniques have used panmictic populations. This thesis introduces the concept of localised niching, where the typically global niching methods are applied to the overlapping demes of a spatially structured population. Two implementations, local sharing and local clearing are presented and are shown to be frequently faster and more robust to parameter settings, and applicable to more problems than their panmictic counterparts. 
 Current SSEAs typically use a single fitness function across the entire population. In the context of multimodal problems, this means each location in space attempts to discover all the optima. A preferable situation would be to use the inherent spatial properties of an SSEA to localise optimisation of peaks. This thesis adapts concepts from multiobjective optimisation with environmental gradients and applies them to multimodal problems. In addition to adapting to the fitness landscape, individuals evolve towards their preferred environmental conditions. This has the effect of separating individuals into regions that concentrate on different optima with the global fitness function. The thesis also gives insights into the expected number of individuals occupying each optima in the problem. 
 The SSEAs and related models developed in this thesis are of interest to both researchers and end-users of evolutionary computation. From the end-user&#65533;s perspective, the developed SSEAs require less a priori knowledge of a given problem domain in order to operate effectively, so they can be more readily applied to difficult, poorly-defined problems. Also, the theoretical findings of this thesis provides a more complete understanding of evolution within spatially-structured populations, which is of interest not only to evolutionary computation practitioners, but also to researchers in the fields of population genetics and ecology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary programming (computer science)</field><field name="subject">evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">electronic data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080902.161336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An uncomfortable engagement : the charismatic movement in the New Zealand Anglican Church 1965-85</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Dale</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the uncomfortable relationship between a mainstream Christian denomination in New Zealand, the Anglican Church, and a movement of religious enthusiasm, the Charismatic Movement. The institutional Anglican Church&#65533;s struggle with the movement went through different stages from initial discomfort and concern, to some cautious acceptance before moving to marginalise it. This marginalisation led to the creation of Anglican Renewal Ministries New Zealand (ARMNZ), an Anglican charismatic institution within the Anglican Church. 
 The reasons for this "struggle to embrace" were that the movement originated, and was resourced from, outside the institutional New Zealand Anglican Church structures; fulfilled needs that the institutional Church in New Zealand was perceived as having failed to fulfil; introduced beliefs and practices perceived as "un-Anglican;" and competed with other initiatives within the New Zealand Anglican Church. This uncomfortable relationship contributed to the failure of the Charismatic leaders to renew spiritually the whole New Zealand Anglican Church. The movement however, helped to broaden the scope of New Zealand Anglicanism and left a legacy of some large charismatic churches. 
 This is the first substantial study of the Charismatic Movement in the New Zealand Anglican Church covering the period from the emergence of the movement in the mid-1960s, through the growth years in the 1970s marked by the formation of a national and ecumenical charismatic agency (Christian Advance Ministries), to the establishment of the Charismatic Movement as an institution within the Anglican Church in the early 1980s.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church of the Province of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Pentecostalism</field><field name="subject">Church renewal</field><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">New Zealand history</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080904.091942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of cold-pressed flaxseed oils and products from their enzymatic transesterification with cinnamic and ferulic acids</field><field name="creator">Choo, Wee Sim</field><field name="description">The physicochemical characteristics of seven cold-pressed flaxseed oils sold in New Zealand were investigated for their fatty acid composition, tocopherol composition, moisture and volatile matter, free fatty acids, chlorophyll pigments, unsaponifiable matter, total phenolic acids and flavanoids, and colour. The seven cold-pressed flaxseed oils exhibited significant variations in their physicochemical characteristics. Quality of the oils in terms of oxidative stability was also investigated. Four oils were found to be within the limit of good stability oil indices, measured in terms of peroxide value, p-anisidine value, conjugated dienoic acids, specific extinction in ultraviolet spectrum, acid value and food oil sensor readings (to indicate total polar compounds). 
 The role of minor constituents in the oxidative stability of two selected oils with different levels of fatty acid composition and minor constituents was investigated. Pan heating at 150&#65533;C caused loss of tocopherols, plastochromanol-8, phenolic acids, chlorophyll pigments, &#946;-carotene and lutein and changes in the fatty acid composition. The pan-heated oils exceeded the limit of good stability oil indices using the measurement mentioned above except for acid value. The addition of &#945;-tocopherol to the oils did not provide enhanced protection to the oils in accelerated aging of oil tests at 60&#65533;C. It was most likely that phenolic acids present in the oils played a dominant role in the oxidative stability of the oils. 
 Lipase-catalyzed transesterification of triolein with cinnamic and ferulic acids using a commercially available immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the lipophilized products as model systems for enhanced protection of unsaturated oil. The lipophilized products were identified using Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectroscopy (ESI-MS). Separation and isolation of two classes of lipophilized products was also achieved using a solid phase extraction method developed in this study for further investigation into the structure-free radical scavenging activity. Free radical scavenging activity was determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) method. The polarity of the solvents proved important in determining the free radical scavenging activity of the substrates. Ferulic acid showed much higher free radical scavenging activity than cinnamic acid, which had limited activity. The esterification of cinnamic acid and ferulic acid with triolein resulted in significant increase and decrease in the free radical scavenging activity, respectively. These opposite effects were due to the effect of addition of electron-donating alkyl groups on the predominant mechanism of reaction (hydrogen atom transfer or electron transfer) of a species with DPPH. The effect of esterification of cinnamic acid was confirmed using ethyl cinnamate which greatly enhances the free radical scavenging activity. Although, compared with the lipophilized cinnamic acid product, the activity was lower. The free radical scavenging activity of the main component isolated from lipophilized cinnamic acid product using solid phase extraction, monocinnamoyldioleoylglycerol, was as good as the unseparated mixture of lipophilized product. Based on the ratio of a substrate to DPPH concentration, lipophilized ferulic acid was a much more efficient free radical scavenger than lipophilized cinnamic acid. 
 Lipase-catalyzed transesterification of flaxseed oil with cinnamic and ferulic acids using Novozym 435 was conducted to evaluate whether the lipophilized products provided enhanced antioxidant activity in the oil. The lipophilized products were identified using ESI-MS and were examined for their free radical scavenging activity toward DPPH in ethanol and ethyl acetate. Ferulic acid showed the highest free radical scavenging activity among all substrates tested while cinnamic acid had negligible activity. The effect of esterification of cinnamic acid and ferulic acid with flaxseed oil was similar to that with triolein. Lipophilized ferulic acid was a better free radical scavenger as compared with lipophilized cinnamic acid and extended the naturally-occuring antioxidant capacity of the flaxseed oil. Lipophilized cinnamic acid did not provide much enhanced radical scavenging activity in the flaxseed oil as the presence of natural hydrophilic antioxidants in the oil had much greater radical scavenging activity. It may still be useful for unsaturated oils with a small amount of natural antioxidants in them. Lipophilized cinnamic and ferulic acids showed higher free radical scavenging activity when tested in a less polar solvent (ethyl acetate) whereas ferulic acid showed better activity in a more polar solvent (ethanol). 
 These results indicate that the choice of solvent for the DPPH assay is critical in evaluating the free radical scavenging activity of substrates of differing polarity, and support previous observations by other authors that the solubility of an antioxidant in relation to the site of oxidation is an important factor for consideration in the use of antioxidants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linseed oil</field><field name="subject">transesterification</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="subject">fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080930.144440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perspectives on belief and change</field><field name="creator">Aucher, Guillaume</field><field name="description">This thesis is about logical models of belief (and knowledge) representation and belief change. This means that we propose logical systems which are intended to represent how agents perceive a situation and reason about it, and how they update their beliefs about this situation when events occur. These agents can be machines, robots, human beings. . . but they are assumed to be somehow autonomous. 
 The way a fixed situation is perceived by agents can be represented by statements about the agents&#65533; beliefs: for example &#65533;agent A believes that the door of the room is open&#65533; or &#65533;agent A believes that her colleague is busy this afternoon&#65533;. &#65533;Logical systems&#65533; means that agents can reason about the situation and their beliefs about it: if agent A believes that her colleague is busy this afternoon then agent A infers that he will not visit her this afternoon. We moreover often assume that our situations involve several agents which interact between each other. So these agents have beliefs about the situation (such as &#65533;the door is open&#65533;) but also about the other agents&#65533; beliefs: for example agent A might believe that agent B believes that the door is open. These kinds of beliefs are called higher-order beliefs. Epistemic logic [Hintikka, 1962; Fagin et al., 1995; Meyer and van der Hoek, 1995], the logic of belief and knowledge, can capture all these phenomena and will be our main starting point to model such fixed (&#65533;static&#65533;) situations. Uncertainty can of course be expressed by beliefs and knowledge: for example agent A being uncertain whether her colleague is busy this afternoon can be expressed by &#65533;agent A does not know whether her colleague is busy this afternoon&#65533;. But we sometimes need to enrich and refine the representation of uncertainty: for example, even if agent A does not know whether her colleague is busy this afternoon, she might consider it more probable that he is actually busy. So other logics have been developed to deal more adequately with the representation of uncertainty, such as probabilistic logic, fuzzy logic or possibilistic logic, and we will refer to some of them in this thesis (see [Halpern, 2003] for a survey on reasoning about uncertainty). 
 But things become more complex when we introduce events and change in the picture. Issues arise even if we assume that there is a single agent. Indeed, if the incoming information conveyed by the event is coherent with the agent&#65533;s beliefs then the agent can just add it to her beliefs. But if the incoming information contradicts the agent&#65533;s beliefs then the agent has somehow to revise her beliefs, and as it turns out there is no obvious way to decide what should be her resulting beliefs. Solving this problem was the goal of the logic-based belief revision theory developed by Alchourro&#769;n, Ga&#776;rdenfors and Makinson (to which we will refer by the term AGM) [Alchourro&#769;n et al., 1985; Ga&#776;rdenfors, 1988; Ga&#776;rdenfors and Rott, 1995]. Their idea is to introduce &#65533;rationality postulates&#65533; that specify which belief revision operations can be considered as being &#65533;rational&#65533; or reasonable, and then to propose specific revision operations that fulfill these postulates. However, AGM does not consider situations where the agent might also have some uncertainty about the incoming information: for example agent A might be uncertain due to some noise whether her colleague told her that he would visit her on Tuesday or on Thursday. In this thesis we also investigate this kind of phenomenon. Things are even more complex in a multi-agent setting because the way agents update their beliefs depends not only on their beliefs about the event itself but also on their beliefs about the way the other agents perceived the event (and so about the other agents&#65533; beliefs about the event). For example, during a private announcement of a piece of information to agent A the beliefs of the other agents actually do not change because they believe nothing is actually happening; but during a public announcement all the agents&#65533; beliefs might change because they all believe that an announcement has been made. Such kind of subtleties have been dealt with in a field called dynamic epistemic logic (Gerbrandy and Groeneveld, 1997; Baltag et al., 1998; van Ditmarsch et al., 2007b]. The idea is to represent by an event model how the event is perceived by the agents and then to define a formal update mechanism that specifies how the agents update their beliefs according to this event model and their previous representaton of the situation. Finally, the issues concerning belief revision that we raised in the single agent case are still present in the multi-agent case. 
 So this thesis is more generally about information and information change. However, we will not deal with problems of how to store information in machines or how to actually communicate information. Such problems have been dealt with in information theory [Cover and Thomas, 1991] and Kolmogorov complexity theory [Li and Vita&#769;nyi, 1993]. We will just assume that such mechanisms are already available and start our investigations from there. 
 Studying and proposing logical models for belief change and belief representation has applications in several areas. First in artificial intelligence, where machines or robots need to have a formal representation of the surrounding world (which might involve other agents), and formal mechanisms to update this representation when they receive incoming information. Such formalisms are crucial if we want to design autonomous agents, able to act autonomously in the real world or in a virtual world (such as on the internet). Indeed, the representation of the surrounding world is essential for a robot in order to reason about the world, plan actions in order to achieve goals... and it must be able to update and revise its representation of the world itself in order to cope autonomously with unexpected events. Second in game theory (and consequently in economics), where we need to model games involving several agents (players) having beliefs about the game and about the other agents&#65533; beliefs (such as agent A believes that agent B has the ace of spade, or agent A believes that agent B believes that agent A has the ace of heart...), and how they update their representation of the game when events (such as showing privately a card or putting a card on the table) occur. Third in cognitive psychology, where we need to model as accurately as possible epistemic state of human agents and the dynamics of belief and knowledge in order to explain and describe cognitive processes. 
 The thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we first recall epistemic logic. Then we observe that representing an epistemic situation involving several agents depends very much on the modeling point of view one takes. For example, in a poker game the representation of the game will be different depending on whether the modeler is a poker player playing in the game or the card dealer who knows exactly what the players&#65533; cards are. In this thesis, we will carefully distinguish these different modeling approaches and the. different kinds of formalisms they give rise to. In fact, the interpretation of a formalism relies quite a lot on the nature of these modeling points of view. Classically, in epistemic logic, the models built are supposed to be correct and represent the situation from an external and objective point of view. We call this modeling approach the perfect external approach. In Chapter 2, we study the modeling point of view of a particular modeler-agent involved in the situation with other agents (and so having a possibly erroneous perception of the situation). We call this modeling approach the internal approach. We propose a logical formalism based on epistemic logic that this agent uses to represent &#65533;for herself&#65533; the surrounding world. We then set some formal connections between the internal approach and the (perfect) external approach. Finally we axiomatize our logical formalism and show that the resulting logic is decidable. 
 In Chapter 3, we first recall dynamic epistemic logic as viewed by Baltag, Moss and Solecki (to which we will refer by the term BMS). Then we study in which case seriality of the accessibility relations of epistemic models is preserved during an update, first for the full updated model and then for generated submodels of the full updated model. Finally, observing that the BMS formalism follows the (perfect) external approach, we propose an internal version of it, just as we proposed an internal version of epistemic logic in Chapter 2. 
 In Chapter 4, we still follow the internal approach and study the particular case where the event is a private announcement. We first show, thanks to our study in Chapter 3, that in a multi-agent setting, expanding in the AGM style corresponds to performing a private announcement in the BMS style. This indicates that generalizing AGM belief revision theory to a multi-agent setting amounts to study private announcement. We then generalize the AGM representation theorems to the multi-agent case. Afterwards, in the spirit of the AGM approach, we go beyond the AGM postulates and investigate multi-agent rationality postulates specific to our multi-agent setting inspired from the fact that the kind of phenomenon we study is private announcement. Finally we provide an example of revision operation that we apply to a concrete example. 
 In Chapter 5, we follow the (perfect) external approach and enrich the BMS formalism with probabilities. This enables us to provide a fined-grained account of how human agents interpret events involving uncertainty and how they revise their beliefs. Afterwards, we review different principles for the notion of knowledge that have been proposed in the literature and show how some principles that we argue to be reasonable ones can all be captured in our rich and expressive formalism. Finally, we extend our general formalism to a multi-agent setting. 
 In Chapter 6, we still follow the (perfect) external approach and enrich our dynamic epistemic language with converse events. This language is interpreted on structures with accessibility relations for both beliefs and events, unlike the BMS formalism where events and beliefs are not on the same formal level. Then we propose principles relating events and beliefs and provide a complete characterization, which yields a new logic EDL. Finally, we show that BMS can be translated into our new logic EDL thanks to the converse operator: this device enables us to translate the structure of the event model directly within a particular axiomatization of EDL, without having to refer to a particular event model in the language (as done in BMS). 
 In Chapter 7 we summarize our results and give an overview of remaining technical issues and some desiderata for future directions of research.

In the Northern Hemisphere the genus is well studied but there is a paucity of data on southern hemisphere Porphyra and even less on New Zealand Porphyra. The species&#65533; taxonomy has been undergoing revision since the late 1990&#65533;s, when it was discovered that the main species P. columbina and P. lilliputana reported for New Zealand were a combination of several endemic species. These species are found from the low to the high intertidal watermark; hence they are exposed to fluctuating stresses such as desiccation, temperature, high light and UV radiation. Algae have evolved a number of mechanisms to adapt to naturally changing increasing abiotic conditions, such as accumulation of screening pigments and changes in antioxidant metabolism during light stress. For terrestrial plants, polyamines (small aliphatic amines) have been shown to be involved in protecting cells from damage under conditions of stress including UV-B radiation; such mechanisms have yet to be identified in algae. 
 The overall aim of this study was to determine the importance of cellular processes in shaping the community structure of Porphyra on a wave-exposed shore on the east coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Porphyra distribution and community structure was assessed by regular monthly monitoring of presence and absence of Porphyra along four transect lines at the site. Enviromnental information was recorded to determine the effects of temperature, light, UV radiation, humidity and wind on Porphyra&#65533;s spatial and temporal distribution. Regular tissue samples were taken for species identification by the application of primers, which were specifically designed during this study. P. cinnamomea and Porphyra spec. "ROS 54" were identified as dominant species present almost throughout the year with a pronounced maximum in presence during late winter and spring, and some weeks of absence during April or May. The two dominant species were recorded from the low to the high intertidal shore, but the mid intertidal was identified as the preferred habitat. Other species that were found were rare and only present for a few months in a very restricted area. It was hypothesised that free radical generation and antioxidant metabolism are associated with desiccation tolerance in Porphyra. An attempt was made to investigate the impact of desiccation stress on Porphyra. The extraction process of antioxidants was problematic and no reproducible results could be obtained. It was attempted to investigate the spatial distribution of spores and conchocelis of different Porphyra species in the field, and determine if those found at Brighton Beach are species-specific in their morphology. This indicated that the two main Porphyra species at Brighton Beach not only prefer to occupy the same habitat but that they also have a morphologically similar conchocelis phase. 
 Mechanisms on a cellular level such as polyamine metabolism affected by environmental (abiotic) stresses are related to the alga&#65533;s ability to adapt to stress and therefore can have an effect on Porphyra&#65533;s distribution along the shore and its presence throughout the year. The depletion of the ozone layer has become an important issue as the effects of increased UV radiation on the environment, especially the intertidal habitat, are revealed. Marine macrophytes possess the main three. polyamines: putrescine, spermidine and spermine of varying levels. For the few species studied, Rhodophyta generally contain higher levels of polyamines than Chlorophyta, while polyamine levels for the one heterokontophyte analysed were between Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta. Levels of the three most common polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) were determined in P. cinnamomea under controlled UV exposure. Tissue discs were exposed to visible light (PAR), PAR and UV-A or PAR, UV-A and UV-B radiation. Discs exposed to PAR and PAR and UV-A showed little change in polyamine levels over a six day trial period, while discs exposed to PAR, UV-A and UV-B showed a significant increase in free, bound soluble and bound insoluble polyamines over the same period of time. Correspondingly levels of ADC and ODC, two enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis, were measured. ODC levels changed little while ADC levels increased significantly during UV-B treatment, indicating that under UV-B stress polyamines are mainly synthesized via the ADC pathway. The experimental set-up and process of this study has not been applied in macroalgal polyamine research and results obtained are the first indication that increased levels of polyamines are involved in protection and/or protection mechanisms in macrophytic algae to prevent UV-B damage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porphyra</field><field name="subject">red algae</field><field name="subject">effect of stress</field><field name="subject">cell metabolism</field><field name="subject">intertidal ecology</field><field name="subject">seashore biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080910.114121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding genetic recoding in HIV-1 : the mechanism of -1 frameshifting</field><field name="creator">Mathew, Suneeth Fiona</field><field name="description">The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses a mechanism of genetic recoding known as programmed ribosomal frameshifting to translate the proteins encoded by the pol gene. The pol gene overlaps the preceding gag gene in the -1 reading frame relative to gag. It contains neither a start codon nor an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to initiate translation of its proteins. Rather the host ribosomes are forced to pause due to tension placed on the mRNA when they encounter a specific secondary structural element in the mRNA. This tension is relieved by disruption of the contacts between the mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons at a &#65533;slippery&#65533; sequence within the ribosomal decoding centre. Re-pairing of the tRNAs occurs in the new -1 frame after movement of the mRNA backwards by one nucleotide, allowing the ribosome to translate the pol gene as a Gag-Pol polyprotein. A change in ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol proteins affects viral assembly, and most significantly dramatically reduces viral infectivity. 
 The prevailing model for the mechanism of -1 frameshifting has focussed on a pre-translocational event, where slippage occurs when the slippery sequence is within the ribosomal A and P sites. This model precludes a contribution from the codon immediately downstream of the slippery sequence leading into the secondary structural element. I have termed this the &#65533;intercodon&#65533;. Often at frameshifting sites it is a termination codon, whereas in HIV-1 it is a glycine codon, GGG. When the intercodon within the frameshift element was changed from the wild-type GGG to a termination codon UGA, the efficiency of frameshifting decreased 3-4-fold in an in vivo assay in cultured human cells. This result mimicked previous data in the group within bacterial cells and cultured monkey COS-7 cells. Changing the first nucleotide of the intercodon to each of the three other bases altered frameshifting to varying degrees, but not following expected patterns for base stacking effects. Such a result would support a post-translocational model for -1 frameshifting. It suggested that the intercodon might be within the ribosomal A site before frameshifting, and that the slippery sequence was therefore within the P and E sites. 
 This was investigated by modulating the expression of decoding factors for the intercodon - the release factor eRF1 and cognate suppressor tRNAs when it was either of the UGA or UAG termination codons, and tRNA[Gly] for the native GGG glycine codon. These were predicted to affect frameshifting only if slippage were occurring when the ribosomal elongation cycle was in the post-translocational state. Overexpression of tRNA[Gly] gave inconsistent effects on frameshifting in vivo, implying that its concentration may not be limiting within the cell. When eRF1 was overexpressed or depleted by RNAi, significant functional effects of decreased or increased stop codon readthrough respectively were documented. Expression of suppressor tRNAs increased readthrough markedly in a stop codon-specific manner. These altered levels of eRF1 expression were able to modulate the +1 frameshifting efficiency of the human antizyme gene. Overexpression of eRF1 caused significant reduction of frameshifting of the HIV-1 element with the UAG or UGA intercodon. Depletion of the protein by contrast had unexplained global effects on HIV-1 frameshifting. Suppressor tRNAs increased frameshifting efficiency at the UAG or UGA specifically in a cognate manner. These results strongly indicate that a post-translocational mechanism of frameshifting is used to translate the HIV-1 Gag-Pol protein. 
 A new model (&#65533;almost&#65533; post-translocational) has been proposed with -1 frameshifting occurring for 1 in 10 or 20 ribosomal passages during the end stages of translocation, because of opposing forces generated by translocation and by resistance to unwinding of the secondary structural element. With translocation still incomplete the slippery sequence is partially within the E and P sites, and the intercodon partially within the A site. The nature of the intercodon influences frameshifting efficiency because of how effectively the particular decoding factor is able to bind to the partially translocated intercodon and maintain the normal reading frame.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV (viruses)</field><field name="subject">HIV infections</field><field name="subject">genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">genetic code</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081006.115352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Raman spectroscopy of complex mixtures</field><field name="creator">McGoverin, Cushla Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis presents several Raman spectroscopic studies of bovine milk-derived products (skim and whole milk powder, anhydrous milk fat, processed cheese and soy cheese made from milk protein). Raman spectroscopy, unlike infrared spectroscopy (both mid- and near-infrared), has not been widely used as an analytical tool within the dairy industry. The purpose of this project was to assess the utility of Raman spectroscopy in several dairy industry relevant problems. FT-Raman spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) reliably predicted the concentration of fat and protein within whole milk and protein within skim milk powders as evidenced by ratios of prediction to deviation in excess of three. It was shown that sample geometry did not significantly affect the calculated predictive models, thereby allowing the simplest, quickest method of sample presentation to be utilised without harming quantification model efficacy. 
 The fat fraction of milk was further investigated, and it was shown that Raman spectra collected from anhydrous milk fat samples were a good basis for solid fat content (SFC) determination. Such spectra were collected when the samples were held at 40 &#65533;C, pretreated by baselining and area normalisation, and analysed using PLS with modified jack-knifing (PLS1-JK). Triacylglycerol class concentrations were also well predicted by PLS1-JK models developed from Raman spectroscopic data. Resonance enhancement of &#946;-carotene within fat was shown to have little effect on the reliability of the optimal prediction model when compared to SFC Raman quantification. 
 Raman microscopic mapping for heterogeneity description of processed cheese and soy cheese mimics was examined. The FT-Raman milk powder constituents study had shown fat and protein Raman spectra within complex dairy mixtures could be distinguished, hence this utility was applied to mapping of cheese systems. Univariate, principal components analysis and multivariate curve resolution methods of analyses were compared; as expected the more complex samples required multivariate methods of analyses. Raman microscopic mapping was not a time efficient method in comparison to the standard method of confocal laser scanning microscopy. However, Raman spectroscopic mapping is a more universal technique which allowed the presence of an unexpected localised constituent within the soy cheese mimics to be observed. It was proposed that this constituent was a crystalline form of a short saturated fatty acid.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Raman spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">dairy products</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081103.112612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proton and iron capture mechanisms of Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 at alkaline pH values</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Duncan George Glenn</field><field name="description">The thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 was able to grow in pH-controlled batch culture containing a fermentable growth substrate (i.e. sucrose) from pH 7.5 to 10.0 with no significant change in specific growth rate, suggesting that this bacterium is a facultative alkaliphile. However, when strain TA2.A1 was grown on non-fermentable carbon sources like succinate, no growth was observed until the external pH was &gt; 9.0, suggesting this bacterium is an obligate alkaliphile. Growth on succinate at pH 9.5 was sensitive to both carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and monensin revealing that both the proton and sodium motive force ([Delta][mu][H&#8314;] and [Delta][mu][Na&#8314;], respectively) were obligate requirements for growth at alkaline pH values. Transport of succinate was driven by a chemical gradient of Na&#8314; ([Delta]pNa&#8314;) that was strictly coupled to [Delta][Psi]. A single transport system was detected for the uptake of succinate, with an apparent K[m] of 19 [mu]M and V[max] of 0.45 nmol succinate/min/mg protein. Succinate transport was pH-dependent, and showed optimal activity at pH values greater than 8.5. Other C&#8324;-dicarboxylates (e.g. malate, fumarate) inhibited the uptake of succinate suggesting that the permease was general for other C&#8324;-dicarboxylates. 
 Cytochrome content, succinate dehydrogenase oxidoreductase, and F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATPase activities were lower in membranes from strain TA2.A1 cells grown at pH 7.5 compared to those cultured at 9.5. These data suggest that oxidative phosphorylation-linked processes are down-regulated at neutral pH values, an observation that mirrored oxygen consumption profiles of strain TA2.A1 in whole cells. To study this phenomenon at a molecular level, we measured ATP synthesis by the F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthase from strain TA2.A1 as a function of pH. The strain TA2.A1 F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthase had a pH optimum for ATP synthesis of 9.0-9.5, and significantly lower rates of ATP synthesis observed below pH 9.0. Analysis of the atp operon from the thermoalkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 and comparison with other atp operons from alkaliphilic bacteria reveals the presence of a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (Bacillus sp. strain TA2.A1 numbering) within the a subunit of these F&#8321;F&#8320;-ATP synthases. We hypothesize that the basic nature of this residue is ideally suited to capture protons from the bulk phase at high pH. To test this hypothesis, a heterologous expression system for the ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F&#8321;F&#8320;) was developed in Escherichia coli DK8 ([Delta]atp). Amino acid substitutions were made in the a subunit of TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; at position 180. Lysine (aK180) was substituted for the basic residues histidine (aK180H) or arginine (aK180R), and the uncharged residue glycine (aK180G). ATP synthesis experiments were performed in ADP plus P[i]-loaded right-side out membrane vesicles energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. When these enzyme complexes were examined for their ability to perform ATP synthesis over the pH range from 7.0 to 10.0, TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; and aK180R showed a similar pH profile having optimum ATP synthesis rates at pH 9.0 to 9.5 with no measurable ATP synthesis at pH 7.5. Conversely, aK180H and aK180G showed maximal ATP synthesis at pH&#65533;s 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. ATP synthesis under these conditions for all enzyme forms was sensitive to DCCD. These data strongly imply that amino acid residue K180 is a specific adaptation within the a subunit of TA2F&#8321;F&#8320; to facilitate proton capture at high pH. At pH values near the pK[a] of K180, the trapped protons readily dissociate to reach the subunit c binding sites but this dissociation is impeded at neutral pH values causing either a blocking of the proposed H&#8314; channel and/or mechanism of proton translocation, and hence ATP synthesis is inhibited. 
 The mechanisms where by alkaliphilic bacteria obtain iron remains unknown. Growth of strain TA2.A1 at pH 9.5 in the presence of the artificial iron chelators ethylenediamine O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (EDDHA) and 2&#65533;2&#65533; dipyridal revealed that iron is an important requirement for aerobic growth at alkaline pH values. Furthermore, biochemical analysis showed that Bacillus alcalophilus and Bacillus pseudofirmus both synthesized orange catecholate siderophores, whilst Bacillus halodurans synthesized a hydroxamate siderophore. These tests showed that strain TA2.A1 synthesized both orange catecholate and hydroxamate siderophore/s. Attempts to purify the catecholate were unsuccessful. No homologues of previously identified non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) genes in Bacillus subtilis and B.halodurans were detected in the genome of strain TA2.A1 using both PCR and Southern hybridization using known non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protons</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Bacillus (bacteria)</field><field name="subject">hydrogen-ion concentration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081104.090840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, politics and policy : creating, deploying and resisting meaning in New Zealand public sport policy</field><field name="creator">Piggin, Joe</field><field name="description">All policy involves the transmission of language and ideas and therefore power. Public sport and recreation policy, through which millions of tax dollars are allocated and which disseminates knowledge and understandings about sport and recreation, is one arena where power relations are constantly formed, reformed and challenged. To understand more about the exercise of power in New Zealand sport and recreation policy, this research examines the dissemination and challenge of policies written by Sparc (Sport and Recreation New Zealand), the organisation responsible for public sport and recreation policy in New Zealand. 
 Three questions were used to understand the exercise of power in New Zealand public policy. These questions included: How is knowledge about sport and recreation produced and disseminated through public policy? How is &#65533;the truth&#65533; about sport and recreation proclaimed and constructed in public policy? How can individuals affected by sport and recreation policy challenge existing relations of power? 
 Theoretically, this research draws on Foucauldian conceptions about power, knowledge, truth and the self. Foucault argued that individuals and groups exercise power discursively, by promoting and deploying certain dominant discourses (or understandings) to the exclusion of other (subjugated) knowledges. As such, the way in which individuals within a society understand knowledge, truth and the self is governed by dominant discourses, and is continually formed discursively over time. Discourses are deployed through a variety of means, including the writing, implementation and resistance of public policy. 
 Methodologically, the thesis merges Foucault&#65533;s archaeological and genealogical approaches to studying discourses. Further, it is guided by a critical discourse analysis, which enables the researcher to question the assumptions behind policy discourses. Data is gathered from various sources, including policy documents, public debate over policy, media articulations of policy and interviews with individuals involved in the writing and resistance of public policy. 
 This research highlights four distinct practices (or techniques) that illustrate how power is exercised in public sport and recreation policy. These techniques include an analysis of bio-power, techniques used to analyse, control, and define the body; governmentality, which dictates the range of possible actions of individuals and citizens; games of truth, through which &#65533;the truth&#65533; is part of a constant discursive debate; and parrhesia, a practice through which citizens can lessen the effect of dominant discourses on their lives. These practices are analysed through specific case studies within the discursive terrain of public sport and recreation policy. With each case study both theoretical considerations and practical suggestions for policy making are offered. 
 Four findings are discussed. Firstly, public policy can discursively and problematically construct understandings of the world through policy goals and measurements. Secondly, the thesis suggests that while public sport and recreation policy is often defended by policy makers as scientific and rational, its writing and implementation is formed by a number of other understandings which cannot be reconciled with the espoused, positivist logic. Thirdly, the thesis suggests that because policy writing is an ongoing process, and because of changing social conditions, &#65533;the truth&#65533; about particular policies is also susceptible to change. Fourthly, despite protestors of public policy often believing their resistance is in vain, this study suggests that their efforts do appear to influence the subsequent writing of policy. 
 The research concludes with reflections about the problematic discursive effects of public policy as well as a consideration of the potential for groups and individuals to challenge or resist understandings about sport and recreation which they do not agree with. In turn, it offers recommendations about the future development of sport public policy, as well as a reflection of this particular type of research approach used. Finally, using this research as a pivot point, sites for future research are considered. In particular, an examination of the effect of public policy on individuals&#65533; lived experiences (as distinct from communities or nations) might be of interest, as would an investigation of effects of global discourses about sport, recreation and physical activity on national public policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sports and state</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081117.154305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary ecology of non-diadromous galaxiid fishes (Galaxias gollumoides and G. &#65533;southern&#65533;) in Southern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crow, Shannan Kyle</field><field name="description">Coexisting species are interesting from evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Sympatry can provide insights into mechanisms that allow stable long-term coexistence, such as niche partitioning, character displacement, interspecific competition and species boundaries. In New Zealand streams, a flock of closely related non-migratory galaxiid fishes exist throughout eastern South Island (Galaxias vulgaris sensu lato). These fishes are largely parapatric, but recent studies have found streams that contain coexisting populations of two newly discovered galaxiids (Galaxias &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides). In such streams there is a cline from allotopic (sections of streams containing predominantly one species) G. &#65533;southern&#65533; (lower altitudes) to allotopic G. gollumoides (higher altitudes), with a syntopic (both species) transition section. Such coexistence makes G. &#65533;southern&#65533; (yet to be formally described) and G. gollumoides ideal for examining the ecology and evolution of sympatric taxa. Very little is known about these two taxa. This thesis aims to detail the morphology, ecology and genetic differentiation between G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides. These factors will be used to address separate species status and the possibility of interspecific competition. Data will also be used to examine resource and morphological shifts in either species between syntopy and allotopy, which maybe consistent with character displacement theory. 
 All fish collected for analysis were first classified as G. &#65533;southern&#65533; or G. gollumoides by eye and by mtDNA. Morphological and ecological (habitat use and diet/isotope enrichment) differentiation between the two species were examined from three sympatric streams (streams containing allotopic and syntopic sites; representing three separate catchments) and four allopatric streams (streams containing only allotopic sites; representing two separate catchments). For sampling purposes, sympatric streams were subdivided into lower (allotopic G. &#65533;southern&#65533;), mid (syntopic) and upper (allotopic G. gollumoides) sections. We used this sampling regime to test for character displacement (i.e. ecological and morphological shifts between syntopy and allotopy). Diet, stable isotope, genetic structuring and hybridisation (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) were analysed from the three sympatric streams. Artificial stream channels were also used to observe the influence of interspecific competition on resource use over a complete diel cycle. 
 G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides were found to be morphologically distinct, differing significantly in 21 of 25 morphological measurements. The two species were also segregated ecologically with G. &#65533;southern&#65533; preferring shallower water, coarser substrate, and higher water velocity, feeding predominantly on mayflies (Ephemeroptera). In contrast, G. gollumoides preferred deeper water, finer substrate and lower water velocity, feeding predominantly on terrestrial invertebrates. Dietary segregation was also reflected by differences in [delta]&#65533;&#65533; Carbon and [delta]&#65533;&#8309; Nitrogen enrichment. Morphological shifts consistent with character displacement were seen in overbite size and mouth size, but neither trait showed consistent statistical differences within and across streams. Ecological shifts were seen in distance to the nearest cover, with G. gollumoides being found further away from cover in syntopy and G. &#65533;southern&#65533; being found the same distance away from cover in syntopy and allotopy. In artificial stream channels, resource use of both species was not affected by the presence of a congener, but both species used faster water velocities during the night while remaining ecologically distinct. AFLP analysis revealed distinct genotypic clustering between these species with no F1 hybrids. Fine-scale genetic structuring was also observed within both species among streams, and among sites within streams. 
 The minimal effect of a congener on resource use suggests that interspecific competition is not a strong force shaping sympatric populations of Southland galaxiids. This is also reflected by the lack of consistent morphological shifts between allopatry and sympatry. Similarly, character displacement does not seem to be a strong influencing G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides. Diel cycles influenced niche expression in both fishes suggesting that abiotic factors may be important in structuring freshwater fish communities in Southland. The fine-scale genetic structuring within both species suggests limited conspecific genetic mixing and movement within streams, which possibly reflects drainage evolution. The absence of F1 hybrids suggests reproductive isolation between G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides which may be associated with assortative mating. The present study provides evidence for the separate status of these sympatric fishes under several species concepts. There is conclusive evidence for morphological, ecological and genetic differentiation between sympatric G. &#65533;southern&#65533; and G. gollumoides, and such segregation maybe associated with long term coexistence in nature.

The &#65533;one-way&#65533; flow of news from a news outlet to the audience has been replaced by a network structure. Following Castells&#65533; concept of the &#65533;network&#65533; (1996) as the central model of information structures, I perpetuate this paradigmatic shift and suggest that networks also transform the professional journalism sphere in many world regions. A revised sphere of journalism is taking shape in which an increasingly global flow of news is evolving and a multiple platform structure of journalism is taking shape in which boundaries between traditional media outlets of print, radio, and television and between national and &#65533;foreign&#65533; journalism are blurring. Furthermore, I argue that a globalized journalistic network sphere is emerging which involves &#65533;traditional&#65533; journalistic outlets and bloggers, media activists, so-called citizen journalists, or user-generated content providers alike. These new journalistic spheres of connectivity establish new (and continuous) links between journalists, their sources as well as their audiences. This fundamental change creates new professional levels of connectivity on one hand and on the other, has severe strategic and organizational implications for the management of print, broadcast and online news outlets. 
 Within this new &#65533;network&#65533; sphere of journalistic practice, the roles of journalistic outlets change. This work suggests a framework that helps to understand journalistic organization today, with innovative work structures based on digital technologies transforming the character and in effect substituting the model of &#65533;top-down&#65533; journalism models by a model that is far more complicated. I argue that within an evolving global news sphere, information flows are multidirectional. Decentralization and non-linearity become the key parameters defining news flows at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The character of this network in the journalism sphere is transnational, crossmedia, and cross professions. Based on results of thirteen qualitative interviews with media practitioners in Germany, the US and the UK, I argue that a new geography of journalism is taking shape in which journalistic outlets are being transformed into nodes. 
 These nodes are arranged in a dense net of information gathers, producers and disseminators and the interactive connections among them constitute what I want to call network journalism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital communications</field><field name="subject">mass media</field><field name="subject">blogs</field><field name="subject">news agencies</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081211.162922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical outcomes of dental implant treatment provided at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago from 1989 to 2005</field><field name="creator">Verma, Rajiv</field><field name="description">Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of oral implant treatment provided at the School of Dentistry, University of Otago from 1989 to 2005. 
 Methods: Oral implant patients (n=320) with 586 implants were identified and invited to attend for a clinical examination. Implant demographics of all the patients were extracted from the files. Implant demographics of the examined and unexamined patients were compared to assess if the examined patients were representative of the total group. One hundred and three patients with 214 implants agreed to attend for an examination. In the clinical examination full mouth plaque scores, probing depths, bleeding on probing and suppuration were measured. In addition, around implants recession and width of keratinized gingiva were also recorded. For the radiographic examination, baseline radiographs and radiographs taken at the time of examination were digitized and compared to measure the amount of bone lost or gained around implants using NIH Image J software. 
 Results: There were equal numbers of males and females with a mean age of 46.3 &#65533; 15 years at the time of implant placement. The smoking history at the time of examination was recorded, 56% of the patients were non-smokers, 37% former smokers, and 7% were current smokers. More than half of the implants (56%) were placed in the anterior region. Based on the type of implant system, 79% were Branemark implants, 10% Straumann, 6% Southern implants and 4% were unknown. Most of the patients (64%) had implant-supported crowns, 19% had fixed denture prostheses, and 17% had implant-supported overdentures. The overall implant survival rate was 97.7% with five implants lost (2.3%) and 8 implants treated for peri-implantitis (3.8%). The mean PD around implants was 2.3mm (SD 0.6mm), mean recession was 0.5mm (SD 0.8mm) and mean attachment level of 2.8mm (SD 0.9mm). Probing depths [greater than or equal to] 4mm with BOP were recorded around implants in 8.9% of patients. The mean full mouth plaque score was 30% while mean plaque score around implants was 15.9%. The average bone loss around implants was 0.3mm (SD 0.8). Maximum bone loss observed was 2.9 mm. 
 Conclusion: The prevalence of peri-implant inflammation and implant survival rates in this group of patients appeared comparable to that reported in the literature. The prevalence of peri-implant lesions was low in the group of patients examined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental implants</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">outcome assessment (medical care)</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081219.145402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of queen mandibular pheromone on locomotor behaviour and learning in worker honey bees Apis mellifera</field><field name="creator">Vergoz, Vanina</field><field name="description">In a honey bee colony, the queen uses queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) to induce young worker bees to feed and groom her. Among its many behavioural and physiological effects, QMP reduces dopamine levels in the brains of young worker bees. Dopamine is a biogenic monoamine involved in numerous functions including motor control and aversive learning. This study investigates the effects of QMP on motor activities and aversive learning behaviour and the potential link between QMP and dopamine levels in the brain of young bees. 
 In young bees under the age of 15-days, QMP dramatically reduced locomotor activity and inhibited aversive learning behaviour. Interestingly in older bees these behaviours were not affected by pheromone. Treating young bees with the dopamine precursor, L-dopa (3.25 [mu]g/mI), partially rescued the levels of locomotor activity in QMP-treated bees, and reduced QMP&#65533;s effects on aversive learning. This suggests that blocking effects of QMP on both locomotor activity and aversive learning result at least in part from QMP-induced changes in brain dopamine levels. 
 Two components of the QMP blend, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol (HVA) and methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (HOB) were examined more closely. Both HVA and HOB are structurally similar to dopamine. HVA was found to mimic the effects of the full QMP blend on aversive learning. Treating bees with HVA reduced aversive learning in young bees. In contrast, treatment with HOB did not affect learning ability. This strongly suggests that HVA is one of the key components that mediates the actions of QMP on aversive learning. 
 The final section of this thesis investigates why it might be advantageous to honey bee queens to block aversive learning and reduce locomotor activity in young worker bees. The study reveals age-related differences in behaviours that individual worker bees display towards QMP. Young bees reared with QMP or collected from a queenright hive showed attraction to QMP. Conversely, older bees displayed avoidance behaviour towards QMP. By blocking the establishment of aversive memories, young bees may be prevented from forming an association between QMP and any unpleasant side effects induced by this pheromone. This may confer significant benefit to the queen by increasing the likelihood of young workers remaining in her attendance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical senses</field><field name="subject">dopamine receptors</field><field name="subject">honeybee</field><field name="subject">behavior</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">pheromones</field><field name="subject">dopaminergic mechanisms</field><field name="subject">motor ability</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081121.161845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heme oxygenase and the use of tin protoporphyrin in hypoxia-ischaemia-induced brain damage : mechanisms of action</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Brad Alexander</field><field name="description">Stroke is the third largest cause of death, and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Treatments are sought to reduce mortality, and increase survival time following an ischaemic stroke. Hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) is the combination of cerebral ischaemia and global hypoxia that can lead to neuronal damage, particularly perinatally. The complex neurodegenerative cascade following ischaemic stroke and HI activates many stress pathways, including heme oxygenase (HO). HO metabolises free heme to release iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently metabolised to bilirubin. This thesis aims to elucidate the role HO plays following HI, and assess any neuroprotective mechanisms using HO modulators. 
 The 26 day old rat model of HI was used to induce the neurodegenerative cascade. All animals were sacrificed 3 days post-insult. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting demonstrated that HO-1 was increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere of both HI (by 1.7 &#65533; 0.1 fold: p = 0.016, n = 4) and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) brains (by 1.6 &#65533; 0.1 fold: p = 0.037, n = 4), compared to controls. HO-2 was constitutively expressed throughout the control brain, but HI upregulated HO-2 expression (by 1.7 &#65533; 0.2 fold: p = 0.027, n = 4) ipsilaterally, whereas MCAO did not alter HO-2 expression. Administration of the HO inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP; 30[mu]mol/kg intraperitoneally) daily, beginning 1 day prior to HI until sacrifice, reduced infarct volume to 50% &#65533; 10 of saline-treated animals (p = 0.039, n = 6-8). The HO inducer ferriprotoporphyrin (FePP; 30[mu]mol/kg) had no effect on infarct volume. HO activity and protein expression were not significantly altered following treatment with SnPP. Therefore, the neuroprotective actions of SnPP may be through alternative mechanisms. SnPP treatment increased HI + saline-induced total nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity by 1.5 &#65533; 0.06 fold (p &lt; 0.001, n = 6-8). Conversely, SnPP inhibited both inducible NOS (50% &#65533; 7 of HI + saline; p = 0.045, n = 7-8) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity (32% &#65533; 6 of HI + saline; p = 0.049, n = 4-8). SnPP treatment also increased mitochondrial complex I activity by 1.6 &#65533; 0.25 fold (p = 0.04, n = 4-8) and complex V activity by 1.7 &#65533; 0.26 fold (p = 0.046, n = 4-8) in the ipsilateral hemisphere. It appears that SnPP is acting on inflammatory and mitochondrial enzymes to produce neuroprotection. In vitro analysis of cultured RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10[mu]g/mL) treated with SnPP (dose range: 10&#8315;&#65533;&#8304;M - 10&#8315;&#8309;M) did not alter nitrite levels or cell viability. However, high dose SnPP (10&#8315;&#8309;M) in the absence of LPS increased nitrite levels from control cells by 2.7 &#65533; 0.7 fold (p = 0.043, n = 6), complementing the in vivo total NOS data. Other mechanisms such as NMDA receptor activation were not affected by 100[mu]M SnPP or 100[mu]M SnCl&#8322; in patch clamped cortical pyramidal neurons. 
 Overall, the role that HO plays following HI remains unclear, but this thesis provides definitive evidence that SnPP (an established HO inhibitor) provides neuroprotection. This neuroprotection may be due to its effects on inducible pathways such as NOS and COX. Therefore, further experimentation is required to fully elucidate the role that HO plays following cerebral ischaemia, and additional in vivo evidence will be necessary to establish HO inhibitors as a putative candidate for cerebral ischaemia neuroprotection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cerebral ischemia</field><field name="subject">cerebral arteries</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">heme oxygenase</field><field name="subject">bilirubin</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="subject">protoporphyrins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090119.150318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of fluorescence-guided Er:YAG laser debridement and mechanical therapy for the non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis : a controlled prospective clinical study</field><field name="creator">Soo, Lingfeng</field><field name="description">Aims: The aim of this study was to compare two different methods of root surface debridement for the treatment of moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis; fluorescence-guided laser debridement using an Er:YAG laser (ERL) or mechanical scaling and root-planing (SRP/UL) using an ultrasonic scaler and hand instruments. The effectiveness of each treatment method was assessed by patient-centred outcomes such as clinical periodontal measurements and patients&#65533; overall experience. 
 Methods: This study was a phase IV randomised controlled clinical trial, with all examinations and treatments carried out between 1st February 2007 and 7th March 2008. Using a split-mouth design, each patient received both test and control treatments. The control quadrants received scaling and root planing using a Piezon&#65533; (EMS, Nyon, Switzerland) ultrasonic scaler and Gracey curettes, while the test quadrants received fluorescence-guided Er:YAG laser root debridement (Keylaser 3, Kavo, Biberach, Germany; panel settings 160mJ/pulse, 10Hz, water spray, 655nm fluorescence calculus-detection system). Full mouth clinical measurements [plaque index (PlI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical attachment level (CAL)] were recorded at baseline, and 6 and 12 weeks post-therapy. A patient questionnaire was used to evaluate patient perception in terms of pain, discomfort and satisfaction during treatment, and 24 hours and one week post-treatment. A wash-out period of 6 weeks enabled each patient to evaluate their experience of each treatment on its own merit. 
 Results: Twenty-eight patients received both treatments and completed the patient perception questionnaire. No significant difference was found between ERL and SRP/UL in terms of pain and discomfort during treatment, and 24 hours and one week post-treatment. In terms of patient satisfaction, none of the patients rated ERL more favourably than SRP/UL immediately following treatment, however no significant difference was found 24 hours later and one week post-therapy. Complete clinical data was collected for 22 patients, four of whom increased their tobacco consumption to [greater than or equal to] 10 cigarettes/day. Therefore, the analysis of clinical data was carried out twice with respect to patients&#65533; smoking status. In patients who smoked [less than or equal to] 9 cigarettes/day (n = 18 patients), ERL provided less PD reduction at 6 and 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.001, 6 weeks; p &lt; 0.05, 12 weeks) than SRP/UL. Even though SRP/UL quadrants had a greater proportion of sites with BOP (% BOP) at baseline, at 6 weeks they showed a significantly greater reduction in %BOP (p = 0.0123) than ERL quadrants, however there was with no significant difference in bleeding scores (p = 0.202) at 12 weeks post-therapy. When patients who smoked [greater than or equal to] 10 cigarettes/day were included in the analyses (n = 22 patients), ERL resulted in less BOP reduction and PD reduction at 6 and 12 weeks following treatment (BOP reduction: 6 weeks p &lt; 0.05, 12 weeks p &lt; 0.001; PD reduction: 6 weeks p &lt; 0.01, 12 weeks p &lt; 0.05). Although statistically significant, the differences between the treatment groups were very small and were not clinically significant. 
 Conclusion: The use of ERL for root surface debridement offers no significant advantages over mechanical therapy in the treatment of moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis, in terms of clinical outcomes and patient perception of pain, discomfort or satisfaction related to the procedure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontitis</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">lasers in dentistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090216.150022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterisation of chitosan derivatives</field><field name="creator">Munro, Natasha Helen</field><field name="description">Chitin is a natural polymer which is extracted from a number of biological sources. This polymer is deacetylated to form the related polymer chitosan. The design and preparation of chitosan derivatives has been investigated to tailor the physical and chemical properties towards specific applications. To this end, this thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of a number of chitosan derivatives. The prepared polymers contained either naphthalimide groups, thiol groups, poly(methyl methacrylate) side chains or poly(oligoethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) side chains. 
 Chitin was successfully extracted and purified from squid pens by literature methods to give polymers with DD values from 12 to 23%. The Kurita method was used to obtain chitosan samples with a range of DD values from 75 to 91%. The prepared polymers were characterised by microanalysis, IR, &#65533;H NMR and solid-state &#65533;&#65533;C NMR spectroscopy. The MW distributions of the chitosan samples were determined by GPC in 0.3 M AcOH/0.2 M AcONa(aq) solution with dextran standards. 
 The N-(naphthalimide)-chitosan derivatives were fluorescent materials and were typically prepared from the reaction of 4-bromonaphthalic anhydride with chitosan. This reaction was thoroughly investigated to find the optimal reaction conditions. The bromo groups were subsequently displaced by one of four nucleophiles: dimethylamine, piperidine, methoxide or vinylferrocene. The polymers were characterised by microanalysis, GPC, IR, &#65533;H NMR, UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The excitation and emission wavelengths and Stokes shifts were dependent on the substituent present in the naphthalimide group. 
 Chitin and chitosan were sequentially reacted with tosyl chloride, potassium thioacetate and sodium methoxide to form the thiolated derivatives. The success of the tosylation reaction was dependent on the synthetic route used and the DD of the polysaccharide. The thiolated chitin polymers were well defined although the samples were completely insoluble. The thiolated chitosan polymers were also characterised and were highly swollen in acetic acid solution. 
 These thiolated polysaccharides were used as macroinitiators for the free-radical polymerisation of MMA. The products obtained from the reaction of 6-mercaptochitin in DMSO with MMA were typically prepared with low yields and low amounts of grafting. The products prepared from 6-mercaptochitosan under the same conditions contained larger amounts of the synthetic polymers although the products were highly variable. MMA was subsequently polymerised with 6-mercaptochitosan in acetic acid buffer to form highly grafted copolymers. 
 Chitosan was reacted with the monomer OEGMA by ATRP to form chitosan-graft-poly(OEGMA) copolymers. Two synthetic routes were investigated. The "grafting-from" route involved. the formation of a chitosan macroinitiator and polymerisation of OEGMA with this polymer. The polymers contained a large amount of grafted side chains as estimated from the &#65533;H NMR spectra. However, the purification was not satisfactory as determined by the presence of two peaks in the GPC traces. The "grafting-to", route involved the formation of poly(OEGMA) by ATRP with activated initiators and subsequent attachment to chitosan. The prepared copolymers showed large differences in their appearance with even very low amounts of grafting. The purification of the polymers prepared by this method was successful with no detectable homopolymer as determined by GPC analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chitosan</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">chitin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090225.161155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation of tourism strategies : a critical analysis of two New Zealand case studies</field><field name="creator">Albrecht, Julia Nina</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the implementation of tourism strategies in a rural community context. Applying public policy implementation theory to tourism research, this study investigates questions related to connections and collaborations between stakeholders, decision-making and inducing action and the relation between objectives in a strategy document and actual outcomes of a policy process. Two tourism planning strategies in rural peripheral communities of New Zealand&#65533;s South Island are investigated adopting a case study approach. While these strategies have in common their geographical and content foci, they differ in terms of commissioning agencies, stakeholder and community involvement, age, resource allocation and planning and implementation approaches. The strategies are four and eleven years old. One is a top-down strategy by a government agency, the other is the result of a community bottom-up process. 
 Using a pragmatic methodical approach and applying a framework that incorporates the implementation environment including stakeholders and decisive events during strategy making, this research assesses the two cases individually and comparatively. Thus applying a non-linear framework and examining strategies that allow for an investigation of longer implementation timeframes, this study overcomes long-standing issues in this type of research. It fills a gap in the literature as it is the first comprehensive analysis of tourism plan implementation to employ public policy implementation theory in one coherent case study approach. 
 The methods applied in this study include semi-structured interviews as well as content analysis of strategy and policy documents, internal documents such as minutes of meetings and newspaper articles. Starting with strategy makers and &#65533;key implementers&#65533;, a snowballing process was used to identify further interviewees and to also follow the policy process as perceived by the main actors in it. This combination of methods allowed for a discovery of the policy story; it assisted a process-oriented investigation of tourism plan implementation while at the same time providing factual information and verifying stakeholder statements through triangulating interview results with the content analysis of documents. 
 Overall, for both the top-down and the bottom-up planning case, implementation was found to be dynamic and highly dependent on the actors at the grassroots level. Many critical stakeholders are volunteer community members who have little or no experience in tourism planning. Most actors are tourism operators or are otherwise involved with the industry. However, as some actors are not actively involved in the tourism industry but represent interests related to the protection of the social and natural environment, their views and actions have the potential to be anti-tourism development and therefore they evoke conflict. 
 The two planning approaches do not differ significantly in terms of bureaucratic control and political guidance. Institutions such as, for example, district councils or economic development agencies, mainly impact on the availability of resources to plan and implement strategy goals. Whether or not goals are achieved therefore ultimately depends on the commitment and interest of all stakeholders involved. Other important factors for policy success are the stability of stakeholder relationships and the level of information and knowledge held by those stakeholders, particularly in situations where there is little support from agencies. This is evident where a stakeholder&#65533;s previous experience in community work and relevant know-how is considered an asset among the volunteers who are responsible for many of the projects. The potential for conflict and the necessity for implementers to &#65533;make do&#65533; with the funding, knowledge and information they have, accounts for high volatility of priorities and goals during implementation. 
 Key findings that relate to both the tourism planning and the public policy literature refer to the similarities of implementation processes for top-down and bottom-up strategies at a grassroots level, the significant role and decisive influence that inexperienced volunteer implementers have in such settings and the high degree to which policy change takes place during such processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island</field><field name="subject">Rakiura</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090310.161051</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi dilemmas and gatekeepers : a qualitative study of Chinese-Western intercultural relationships in marketing</field><field name="creator">Gao, Hongzhi</field><field name="description">Guanxi literally means a &#65533;special personal relationship&#65533; in Chinese social and business life. It is commonly considered a cultural barrier for many foreign entrants in China due to its exclusiveness, complexity and dynamics. This research study aims to understand the constraints and dilemmas in Chinese-Western intercultural business contexts. Specific questions addressed in this study are: (a) What are the constraints and dilemmas in Chinese-Western intercultural relationships in marketing? (b) How do business actors manage these constraints and dilemmas? (c) What new insights can be developed in order to improve Chinese-Western intercultural marketing relationships? These questions are important because most theoretical understandings of business relationships are developed in Western contexts. Furthermore, the emergence of China as a major global trading nation gives weight to these questions. 
 A case study strategy is adopted with a focus on Chinese-Western intercultural marketing relationships. This study follows the International/Industrial Marketing &amp; Purchasing Group (IMP)&#65533;s research tradition that views relationship building as the consequence of interaction among networks of actors. The research methodology is both qualitative and interpretive. A hermeneutical approach under the constructivist paradigm is adopted to interpret empirical findings from interviews with 58 Chinese and Western business managers. 
 Analysis was conducted in three hermeneutical stages. Each stage progressed and revealed new sources of understanding. The first stage provided a contextual understanding of Chinese-Western intercultural business relationship by identifying &#65533;three circles&#65533; of relationship development activity based on behavioural norms, respectively the insider (guanxi) circle, an emerging intercultural circle and an outsider circle. This allowed me to develop a bridging perspective of guanxi ties in the emerging intercultural &#65533;middle&#65533; circle. The second stage revealed three types of guanxi dilemmas for outsiders. The second stage also disclosed seven kinds of perceived risk derived from Confucian ideology. The third stage developed a new concept of guanxi gatekeeper. These guanxi gatekeepers play vital roles in managing outsiders&#65533; dilemmas and the risks perceived by insiders in developing intercultural (interpersonal) relationships. They engage two gatekeeping processes: reciprocal gatekeeping and symbolic gatekeeping. It is my conclusion that the gatekeeping view of guanxi processes provides an improved understanding of relationship development in Chinese-Western intercultural business contexts. 
 This study contributes to the marketing literature by identifying a new interpersonal network perspective and also the network position of guanxi gatekeeper in emerging Chinese-Western intercultural business networks. Thus, indirectly connected actors are seen to work independently but also interdependently through the involvement of gatekeepers. This study has an important strategic implication for Western entrants in China: Western firms and managers can avoid la guanxi (forcing direct relationships with innermost guanxi insiders) and instead operate through the facilitation of a middle force - guanxi gatekeepers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">business etiquette</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090417.113317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Haunted, religious modernity and reenchantment</field><field name="creator">Repphun, Eric</field><field name="description">The academic study of religion has for too long laboured under a flawed understanding of the relationship between modernity and religion. Any narrative of the displacement of religion by a universal and secularising modernity fails to recognise the complexity of the historical and cultural realities. While modernity has demonstrably contributed to the erosion of certain forms of religion, there is a growing body of evidence, and new interpretations of existing evidence, which suggest that the interconnections between modernity and religion are far more complex than any simple opposition could account for. Indeed, modernity appears, in certain circumstances, to be capable of producing its own religious effects. This thesis seeks to answer what then becomes a fundamental question: what does it mean for the study of religion if we accept that modernity can generate the religious? 
 New conceptual tools are needed to deal critically with the far-reaching consequences of embracing the true density of modernity. The study of religion can be greatly enhanced by one such concept: reenchantment. However, reenchantment, as an interpretive framework, must be carefully formulated. Reenchantment cannot be properly understood as a reversal of disenchantment, a conception this thesis will be calling thin reenchantment, but as an ongoing dialectic of reenchantment and rationalisation, which this thesis will be calling thick reenchantment. The formulation of a credible and useful concept of reenchantment can in turn be aided by the work of the philosopher and cultural critic Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard&#65533;s work is not itself an expression or example of reenchantment, but it demonstrates a remarkable congruence with the concept of thick reenchantment, as both interrogate dominant understandings of modernity in relationship to differing systems of value. 
 The thesis is divided into two sections. The first, substantially longer, section presents in some detail thick reenchantment as an interpretive frame. Though it does not claim to offer any new evidence, the first chapter outlines the evidential background for the thesis, which adopts the concept of religious modernity, developed by sociologist Danie&#768;le Hervieu-Le&#769;ger, as a way of framing this evidence. The second chapter develops the concept of reenchantment and the typology of thin and thick reenchantment in relation to the foundational work of Max Weber. The third chapter is an analysis and review of the extant multidisciplinary discourse on reenchantment. The fourth chapter, the theoretical core of the thesis, presents an innovative reading of Baudrillard&#65533;s considerable body of work. 
 The second section elaborates on a further insight of the first - that text is a necessary element in the study of religious modernity - by offering detailed readings of the work of three contemporary authors - novelists Douglas Coupland and Chuck Palahniuk and filmmaker Tom Tykwer - as instantiations of the sorts of cultural artefacts that the conceptual framework of thick reenchantment means to explore. 
 Though its claims remain conceptual and interpretive rather than evidential, normative, or explanatory, this thesis, interdisciplinary as it is, is intended as a contribution to a number of related fields, from the study of contemporary literature and film to the exploration of Baudrillard&#65533;s work, which the study of religion has to date largely neglected, to its detriment However, its primary purpose is to suggest new and fruitful ways to approach the study of religion in modernity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">religion and sociology</field><field name="subject">religion and culture</field><field name="subject">Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007)</field><field name="subject">Douglas Coupland</field><field name="subject">Chuck Palahniuk</field><field name="subject">Tom Tykwer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090218.141700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From art souvenir to tourist kitsch : a cultural history of New Zealand Paua shell jewellery until 1981</field><field name="creator">van de Wijdeven, Petronella Johanna Maria</field><field name="description">This cultural history of paua shell jewellery redresses the lack of visibility of such objects as a significant part of 20th century New Zealand material culture and provides a basis for a more balanced interpretation beyond its stereotyping as tourist kitsch. It questions why quality paua shell jewellery made before the late 1960s failed to gain recognition with most New Zealanders until fairly recently as anything other than tourist souvenirs. 
 Over 1,500 items of paua shell jewellery, mainly in private collections, formed the basis for this multidisciplinary research project that incorporates historical, anthropological and material culture studies approaches to write a cultural history of such jewellery. The objects were photographed and where available, their provenance recorded. A visual analysis of the items - paying attention to details of design and construction - established various, often overlapping categories that facilitated the dating and identification process. Gradually, a picture of the production of paua shell jewellery over the decades emerged. The wider socio-cultural context was then built using archival sources, various publications, conversations with one-time industry representatives, and discussions with original owners of paua shell jewellery. Interpretation of the material established multiple roles for paua shell jewellery over the decades for various groups of people. 
 Changes over time provided insights into aspects of identity creation by New Zealanders. Until the 1920s, the shell&#65533;s main role had been as a European applied arts material and as inlay for Maori woodcarvings. Paua shell as a commercial souvenir material developed during the Depression and was shaped by the interaction between an emerging nationalism and a democratising of travel in New Zealand. Paua shell native bird brooches functioned as affordable alternatives to greenstone souvenirs for the working-class tourists that began exploring their own country. 
 In addition to its role as emblems of nationhood in the interwar years, paua shell jewellery had meaning as souvenirs for American servicemen stationed in New Zealand during the War, and as patriotic tokens for its own population due to its association with disabled servicemen. Paua shell jewellery functioned as acknowledgement of settlement for European immigrants in the post war era, and as travel memento for trans-Tasman tourists from the mid 1950s. New Zealand girls received paua shell items as first jewellery, and women wore it as dress or costume jewellery. 
 Until the increase of tourism in the 1960s, paua shell jewellery had existed on a number of planes. The exploitation of paua shell by the tourist industry, however, upset the balance and its dominance as souvenir forced a retreat of alternative uses. Other than as tourist souvenir, paua shell jewellery became invisible to the local population. Their withdrawal from an association with paua shell as a cultural marker of national identity explains why so many New Zealanders were uncertain about liking or disliking paua shell jewellery until recently.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shell jewelry</field><field name="subject">shellcraft</field><field name="subject">souvenirs (keepsakes)</field><field name="subject">paua</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090429.162501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel fluorescent organometallic materials</field><field name="creator">Tagg, Woo Chiat</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and properties of some extended donor-acceptor dyads with the donor being a ferrocenyl moiety and a fluorescent naphthalimide group as the acceptor. Two series of extended ferrocenyl-naphthalimide dyads were prepared in reasonable yield depending on the synthetic route. The first are a series of three ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads in which the spacers are phenyl, biphenyl and anthryl and the second are a series of three ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads in which the spacers are 2,2&#65533; -bithiophene, 2,5-dimethoxybenzene and tetrafluorobenzene groups. 
 The molecular structures of some compounds have been determined by X-ray diffraction although with many challenges because of the extensive [pi]-[pi] stacking of molecules that leads to ready aggregation in the solid state, particularly for the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, in which the naphthalimide bears a methyl head group. In order to reduce the [pi]-[pi] stacking effect between the molecules and also to produce chiral molecules for the potential nonlinear optical applications, a chiral &#945;-methylbenzylamine was introduced as the head group of naphthalimide for the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads. The resulting comounds successfully gave crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray structural investigation. 
 While the oxidative electrochemistry of the ferrocenyl compound in the two series of dyads was largely predictable (E&#65533; ~ 0.55 V for ferrocenyl-CH=CH- and ~ 0.72 V for ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-), the presence of spacers in the dyads appeared to afford stability to the reduced naphthalimide species. This was exhibited by the appearance of chemically reversible one-electron reduction processes for each of the compounds investigated. Similar unusual chemical reversibility was also shown by the spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide precursor systems. For the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the oxidation and reduction potentials closely resembled those of the simple ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer systems. This suggested that augmentation of the simple ferrocenyl-CH=CH-phenyl, -biphenyl and -anthryl systems with an alkyne linked naphthalimide unit showed little influence on the oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety or the reduction of the naphthalimide unit. However, for the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the oxidation and reduction potentials are influenced by the inductive effects of the spacers. While an anodic shift was observed for the dyad with the electron-withdrawing spacer tetrafluorobenzene, a cathodic shift was displayed for the dyads with the electron-donating spacers 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene compared to that in the simple ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide system. 
 The spectroscopic properties of the ferrocenyl-CH=CH-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads showed that interpolation of the aromatic spacers does not interfere with the internal charge separation. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety resulted in bleaching of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer band at ~ 500 nm and the growth of a new band in the near infrared region at ~ 1000 nm. This new band can be assigned to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition, where the ferrocenium now acts as an acceptor to the naphthalimide donor. 
 For the ferrocenyl-C[triple bond]C-spacer-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide dyads, the spectroscopic properties showed that the mutually electron-withdrawing tetrafluorobenzene and naphthalimide units had little interaction despite their connection by a conductive alkyne link. In contrast, the dyads containing the electron-donating 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene showed some degree of interaction between the spacer and the naphthalimide fragments. This was evidenced by the appearance of a broad absorption band in the range 410 - 440 nm, which is associated with an orbital that is delocalised between the spacer and the naphthalimide fragments. Again, the roles of donor and acceptor were reversed on oxidation of the ferrocenyl moiety. This resulted in the growth of a new near infrared band at ~750 mn for the dyad containing the tetrafluorobenzene spacer and at ~ 1000 nm for the dyads with 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene and 2,5 -dimethoxybenzene spacers. The ferrocenyl unit went from being a net donor to ferrocenium, which was acting as an acceptor, with the tetrafluorobenzene spacer adopting the donor role more reluctantly than the delocalised 2,2&#65533;-bithiophene-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide and 2,5-dimethoxybenzene-C[triple bond]C-naphthalimide moieties. 
 1,3,5-Tri- and 1,2,4,5-tetra-substituted benzene cores were also used as spacers for the preparation of extended arrays of ferrocenyl-naphthalimide dyads. Utilisation of the 1,3,5 -tri-substituted benzene core enabled the core to be embellished in three directions, resulting in Y-motif extended arrays containing either one ferrocenyl unit [(ethenylferrocenyl)-C&#8326;H&#8323;-(C[triple bond]C-C&#8326;H&#8325;)&#8322;] or one naphthalimide moiety [(4-piperidino-N-propargyl-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8323;-(Br)&#8322;]. With the 1,2,4,5-tetra-substituted benzene core, the extension of the core was possible in four directions and gave extended arrays in an X-motif. Again, these systems contained either ferrocenyl units [bis(alkoxyferrocenyl)-C&#8326;H&#8322;-(C[triple bond]C-C&#8326;H&#8325;)&#8322;] or naphthalimide moieties [(tetrakis-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8322;]. Attempts to incorporate both ferrocenyl and naphthalimide fragments into the X- or Y-motif extended arrays were unsuccessful. 
 By adding C&#8322;Co&#8322;(CO)&#8326;dppm across the triple bonds of two of the four alkyne groups in the X-motif naphthalimide system [(tetrakis-naphthalimide)-C&#8326;H&#8322;], it was possible to incorporate two oxidisable C&#8322;Co&#8322;(CO)&#8324;dppm cluster units into the molecule. The electrochemistry of the resulting system showed two discrete oxidation processes, suggesting the possibility of some interaction between the dicobalt cluster redox centres.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ferrocene</field><field name="subject">naphthalene</field><field name="subject">organometallic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090430.133100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Connecting and changing places : globalisation and tourism mobility on the Otago Peninsula, Dunedin, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reiser, Dirk</field><field name="description">Globalisation, localisation and tourism are processes that are closely interconnected. They relate to historical mobilities and non-mobilities of humans, ideas and capital that impact on environment, economy, culture, politics and technology. Yet, these impacts on local tourism destinations are not well researched. 
 Small destinations are not researched in relation to the impact of globalisation and tourism overtime. The thesis develops an historical understanding of globalisation, localisation and tourism within the context of the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin, New Zealand. It portrays the &#65533;glocalisation&#65533; processes, the specific mix of local and global forces that shaped the Otago Peninsula and created the basis for the current conditions, especially for tourism. 
 The research on the Otago Peninsula clearly identifies different stages of mobilities to the place, generally following a similar pattern to other places in New Zealand settled in the latest phase of colonialism. The first settlers, the Polynesians, were followed by white explorers, sealers and whalers at the beginning of the 19th century who exploited a local resource that was valuable to international markets. After the over-exploitation of the resource white settlers arrived to &#65533;conquer&#65533; nature and to improve on their living conditions in a new country. They provided the basis for the following mobilities by developing or facilitating a local, national, regional and international infrastructure. Towards the end of the 19th century the major European migration had ended. The next major mobility movement was recreationists from the close urban centre of Dunedin who used the infrastructure on the Otago Peninsula at weekends, as time, money and technology limited mobilities to places further away. From the 1920s onwards, when these limitations were reduced by, for example, a better infrastructure and new technological developments such as the car and more disposable income and time, New Zealanders started to more widely discover their own country. Finally, international travellers started to arrive in the 1960s after the main obstacle, the distance and time needed to travel to New Zealand and the Otago Peninsula, was reduced by technological development, especially airplanes. During all of these phases of mobility, the Otago Peninsula became increasingly interconnected with other places on the globe, creating the conditions for tourism. 
 In this study, within the context of the phase model of mobilities, a variety of research methods were used to assess the impact of globalisation, localisation and tourism on the Otago Peninsula. These methods include literature, newspaper, local promotional materials and photographic images analysis, as well as participant observation and historical interviews. 
 The research clearly highlights the changes to the Otago Peninsula created by historical events that happened as a consequence of human mobility. Internal and external conditions at different geographical scales, ranging from the local to the global, changed the economy, the environment, culture, politics and the use of technology on the Otago Peninsula. The place was (and still is) constantly glocalised. Consequently, international tourism, as one of the more recent forces, has to be managed within this historical framework of stretched social relations, the intensification of flows, increasing global interactions and the development of global infrastructure and networks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">internal migration</field><field name="subject">outdoor recreation</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090515.161047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The link between mental health problems and sexual risk taking in a general population sample</field><field name="creator">Ramrakha, Sandhya</field><field name="description">This thesis examined whether mental health problems and sexual risk taking were associated in a general population sample and if so, the extent and direction of this association. The thesis begins with a review of theories of risk taking; sexual risk and mental health correlates; and the existing studies linking mental health and sexual risk taking. Three empirical studies were conducted. 
 Study One produced new evidence that a range of psychiatric disorders were linked to early sex (&lt;16 years), risky sex (multiple partners and inconsistent condom use in the past year at age 21) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by the age of 21 years. Young people who present with schizophrenia spectrum disorder were also prone to early and risky sex and STIs. Second, depression, the single most common psychiatric problem in the population, was also associated with risky sex and STIs. The risk increased with comorbid psychiatric conditions. 
 Study Two addressed the issue of directionality, specifically examining if childhood behavioural and emotional problems and early adolescent psychiatric disorder predicted later sexual risk taking and STIs. Main findings showed that childhood antisocial behaviour increased the likelihood of risky and early sex, and that low levels of childhood anxiety increased the likelihood of later risky sex and having STIs. Involvement with delinquent peers mediated the association between childhood antisocial behaviour and risky and early sex. To a lesser degree, attachment to parents mediated the association between antisocial behaviour and early sex. These factors did not mediate the association between low levels of childhood anxiety and later sexual outcomes. No associations were found between adolescent psychiatric disorder and later sexual risk taking, with the exception of conduct disorder. However, it is important to note that by excluding the group who had early sex in order to establish temporality, other behaviours of interest exhibited by this group were also excluded. 
 The third study examined whether sexual risk taking was associated with an increased risk of subsequent mental health problems, addressing the issue of directionality in the other direction. Main findings showed that reports of early sex, multiple sex partners and STIs elevated the risk of later substance dependence disorders. Importantly, this association persisted after controlling for &#65533;baseline&#65533; levels of psychiatric disorder. Early sex also predicted later conduct disorder, even after controlling for prior conduct disorder. In contrast, early sex, multiple sex partners and acquisition of STIs were unrelated to later diagnoses of anxiety or depression. The significant associations with multiple sex partners and STIs were also shown for incident cases of substance dependence. 
 Moderation analyses revealed no differences between the sexes in any of the studies except in Study Three. Specifically, the association between multiple sex partners and substance dependence appeared to be stronger for males than females for up to 10 sex partners and substantially stronger for females than for males beyond ten sex partners. 
 The final chapter in this thesis reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the studies in this thesis before considering the implications of the results for theory, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">mentally ill</field><field name="subject">sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">sexual behavior surveys</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090527.155127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A rising tide : the growth of Evangelicalism and Evangelical identity among Presbyterians, Anglicans and University students in New Zealand, 1930-1965</field><field name="creator">Lange, Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis relates the resurgent evangelical Protestantism of mid-twentieth century New Zealand to the extensive international historiography which has emerged over the last thirty years, especially through the work of such scholars as David Bebbington in Britain and others in the USA, Canada and Australia. Understanding evangelicalism as a both an historical movement and a recurring set of doctrinal commitments, the new literature has highlighted evangelicalism as a trans-denominational and international movement, sharing such features as those identified in Bebbington&#65533;s quadrilateral. Weaving together the study of numerous key individuals, churches and organisations, the thesis argues that a self-aware, cross-denominational and fairly cohesive evangelical stream developed within New Zealand Protestantism between about 1930 and 1965. The thesis demonstrates that the university Evangelical Unions and the Inter-Varsity Fellowship (NZ) - both founded following a schism with the more liberal SCM in the early 1930s - were key factors in the reconstruction of evangelical identity and confidence and in the development of vigorous and expanding evangelical movements in New Zealand&#65533;s two largest Protestant denominations. The two key pre-war church leaders who inspired those movements, Thomas Miller (a confessionalist Presbyterian) and William Orange (a devotional Anglican), worked closely with the Evangelical Unions and IVF, and the leaders of the post-war evangelical movements (such as Graham Miller) had been significantly shaped by the EUs and IVF. Mid-century New Zealand evangelicalism was theologically conservative, but also emphasised reason, moderation and restraint, and those values were constantly reinforced by such leaders as Dr. John Laird and Professor E.M. Blaiklock. The renascent New Zealand evangelical movement rejected extremism, anti-intellectualism and ecclesiastical separatism. It explicitly distanced itself from American fundamentalism. In its outlook and cultural style, mid-twentieth century New Zealand evangelicalism largely reflected the prevailing Britishness of New Zealand in that period, and was strongly influenced by the British IVF. By the early 1960s, evangelicalism had become an increasingly significant element within Protestantism in New Zealand. As the movement matured, it had also become less cohesive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">christian college students</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="subject">evangelicalism</field><field name="subject">student movements</field><field name="subject">Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Evangelical Unions (N.Z.)</field><field name="subject">Presbyterian Church of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Church of the Province of New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Thomas Miller (1875-1948)</field><field name="subject">William Orange (1889-1966)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090618.161648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of cool temperature on egg incubation, thermoregulation and physiological performance of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) : implications for conservation programmes</field><field name="creator">Besson, Anne Amelie</field><field name="description">Tuatara (Sphenodon spp.) were once widespread over both the North and the South Islands of New Zealand approximately 1000 years ago but are now restricted to offshore islands due to introduced predators and habitat destruction. The survival of tuatara is now threatened by climate change because of isolation on islands that prevent them from migrating to cooler regions, and by their limited capacity to adapt due to their long life span and low genetic diversity. The thermal suitability of cooler regions for future translocations could be the key for tuatara conservation. The overall aim of the study was to determine the effect of cool temperature on the physiology, behaviour and egg incubation of Cook Strait tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). As well answering specific questions about tuatara and their adaptation to cool temperature this study aimed at answering general questions about the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of reptiles.
I first compared the preferred body temperature, feeding responses and tolerance to cold temperature of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) with three lizard species that inhabit the Otago region of southern New Zealand: Hoplodactylus maculatus, Naultinus gemmeus and Oligosoma maccanni. As well as testing the co-adaptation hypothesis between preferred body temperature and physiological performance of reptiles, I wanted to determine whether tuatara (which are planned to be reintroduced from a warmer site to the Otago region) have similar responses to cool temperature as do Otago lizard species. I found that tuatara show responses to cold temperatures similar to those of lizards from southern New Zealand, suggesting that if tuatara are translocated outside of their geographical range, they are likely to survive.
I then tested if tuatara were capable of modifying their thermoregulatory behaviour if translocated to a cooler region. To do so, I conducted a laboratory experiment in which tuatara were provided with three thermal treatments corresponding to the thermal environments they would experience in their current habitat and the proposed reintroduction site. Contrary to the prediction of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation, tuatara became active thermoregulators when the thermal quality of the habitat decreased. The results suggest that the model is less applicable to cold-adapted species and that if translocated to cooler regions, tuatara will be able to adjust their thermoregulatory behaviour to their thermal environment.
Tuatara are temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) reptiles and their translocation to cooler regions could have an dramatic impact on the sex ratio of new populations. To determine if potentially lower incubation temperature would be a limiting factor for the reintroduction of tuatara, I translocated eggs to the proposed reintroduction site. Some tuatara embryos developed at the site (and later hatched in the laboratory), but incubation lasted longer than in natural nests and all hatchlings were female. This trend observed in biased sex ratio might change in the context of climate change as an increase of soil temperature by 3&#65533;C would allow the production of males at the proposed site.
The present study demonstrates that the translocation of tuatara further south, outside of their current geographical range, is possible and recommended. Tuatara show similar responses to cool temperatures compared with lizards that live in southern New Zealand, they can also adjust their thermoregulatory behaviour if translocated to cooler habitats, and tuatara embryos could potentially develop successfully in cooler regions. The greatest chance for the future survival of tuatara and TSD species in general, lies in translocation to other locations that are thermally suitable.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tuatara</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">eggs</field><field name="subject">incubation</field><field name="subject">effect of temperature</field><field name="subject">body temperature</field><field name="subject">cold adaptation</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Stephens Island</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090713.160643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical pharmacology of aminoglycosides in neonates</field><field name="creator">Sherwin, Catherine M. T</field><field name="description">The aims of this Thesis were to investigate early markers of neonatal sepsis and patient-factors affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of aminoglycosides in the treatment of neonatal sepsis.
A prospective cohort study of neonates commenced on gentamicin for suspected sepsis was performed between 1 July 2002 and 28 February 2007. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) plots were used to assess potential markers of sepsis against culture positive sepsis. When sepsis was first suspected, the most promising tests were interleukin (IL) IL-12(p70) with an area under the curve (95% CI) for the ROC of 0.74 (0.63-0.86), and which (with a cut-off at 75 pg/mL) had a sensitivity (95% CI) of 28% (20-36%) and a specificity of 98% (96-100%). IL-10 had a sensitivity of 17% (10-23%) and a specificity of 99% (97-100%).
Retrospective studies of neonates treated with gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin for suspected sepsis were used to identify patient characteristics that affected aminoglycoside PKPD properties. Population PK modelling used NONMEM&#65533; v.5 to determine aminoglycoside clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V). Logistic regression was used to examine the treatment outcome measures (serum peak and trough concentrations and ototoxicity). Simulations of new dosing regimens were undertaken for netilmicin and amikacin using MATLAB&#65533;
The final gentamicin PK covariate model gave CL = 0.097 x (current weight/2)[1.3] x (postnatal age/7)[0.29] and V = 1.07 x (current weight/2)[0.8]+ (confirmed sepsis) x 0.13. A 10% increase in gentamicin V in neonates with sepsis was estimated. For amikacin, 17 (35%) of 49 episodes of confirmed sepsis met the treatment failure criteria from 12 (15%) individual patients. The final amikacin PK covariate model was CL = 0.23 x (current weight/2)[0.691] x (postmenstrual age/40)[3.23] and V = 0.957 x (current weight/2)[0.89]. PD analysis determined risk factors linked to hearing impairment in neonates treated with amikacin included: co-medication with vancomycin, high C-reactive protein concentration and low gestational age. Simulation of a new amikacin dosing regimen recommended: 15 mg/kg 36 hourly, 14 mg/kg 24 hourly, and 15 mg/kg 24 hourly, for neonates [less than or equal to] 28 weeks, 29 to 36 weeks, and [greater than or equal to] 37 postmenstrual age, respectively.
For netilmicin, the final PK covariate model was CL = 0.192 x (current weight/2)[1.35] x (postmenstrual age/40)[1.03], V = 1.5 x (current weight/2)[0.3]. Simulation of a new optimal dosing regimen for netilmicin was: 5 mg/kg 36 hourly, 5 mg/kg 24 hourly, 6 mg/kg 24 hourly, and 7 mg/kg 24 hourly, for neonates [less than or equal to] 27, 28 to 30, 31 to 33, and [greater than or equal to] 34 weeks postmenstrual age, respectively.
IV infusions representing gentamicin administration to neonates of 2.5 kg and 0.5 kg in the NICU setting (30 minutes gentamicin infusion then a 30 minute saline flush) showed the larger neonates received 80% of the drug within 60 minutes. This increased to 90-95% by 75 minutes. However, in extremely low birth weight neonates (0.5 kg), only 60% of the intended gentamicin dose was delivered by 60 minutes (70% by 75 minutes).
In conclusion: IL-12(p70) and IL-10 were identified as promising diagnostic tests to confirm sepsis in neonates. Confirmed sepsis caused a 10% increase in V of gentamicin in neonates, suggesting larger initial dosages (mg/kg) are required for effective treatment of neonates with sepsis. Aminoglycoside clearance in neonates is predominantly affected by current weight, postmenstrual age or postnatal age. Adjusting netilmicin and amikacin doses based on current weight, and dosing interval based on both postmenstrual age and current weight improves drug efficacy. Identification of co-medication with vancomycin, low gestational age, and high C-reactive protein during treatment with amikacin increases risk of hearing impairment. The delivery of gentamicin administrated by IV infusion is substantially extended in extremely low birth weight neonates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aminoglycosides</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">neonatal infections</field><field name="subject">septicemia</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090821.160736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The combination of probiotics, 12-monoketocholic acid (bile acid) and gliclazide in a rat model of type 1 diabetes : hypoglycemic effects, pharmacokinetics and transport studies</field><field name="creator">Al-Salami, Hani</field><field name="description">Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a metabolic disorder characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta-islet cells leading to complete loss of insulin production. Gliclazide is used in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) to stimulate insulin production but it also has beneficial extrapancreatic effects which make it potentially useful in T1D. In fact, some T2D patients continue to use gliclazide even after their diabetes progresses to T1D since it provides better glycemic control than insulin alone. About 30% of a gliclazide dose undergoes enterohepatic recirculation which may contribute to the observed high interindividual variability in its pharmacokinetics. This may limit its efficacy in T1D especially since diabetes can disturb the gut microbiota and give rise to changes in bile composition and enterohepatic recirculation. Improving the absorption of gliclazide through the use of bile acids and probiotics may reduce this variability and improve the efficacy of gliclazide in T1D. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the interaction between the semisynthetic bile acid, 12-monoketocholic acid (MKC) and gliclazide in terms of pharmacokinetics and hypoglycemic effects in a rat model of T1D with and without probiotic pretreatment. A parallel ex vivo (Ussing chamber) study was carried out to investigate the mechanism of the interaction.
Sensitive LC-MS and HPLC methods (Chapter 2) were developed to determine the concentrations of gliclazide and MKC in Ringer's solution and rat serum. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intravenous (i.v.) alloxan (30 mg/kg). Rats with blood glucose concentration &gt; 18 mmol/l and serum insulin concentration &lt; 0.04 [mu]g/l, 2-3 days after alloxan injection were considered diabetic. A total of 280 male Wistar rats (Chapter 3) were randomly allocated into 28 groups (n=10) of which 14 were made diabetic. Then 7 groups of healthy and 7 groups of diabetic rats were gavaged with probiotics (10&#8312; CFU/mg, 75 mg/kg) every 12 hours for three days after which single doses of gliclazide (20 mg/kg), MKC (4 mg/kg) or the combination were administered either by tail vein injection (i.v.) or by gavage. The other 14 groups (7 healthy and 7 diabetic) were gavaged with saline every 12 hours for three days and then treated in the same way. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein for 10 hours after the dose and analyzed for blood glucose, serum gliclazide &amp; serum MKC concentrations. Serum concentration-time curves for gliclazide and MKC were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.
In the parallel ex vivo study (Chapter 4), 88 rats were randomly divided into 22 groups (n=4 rats per group, 8 chambers per rat), of which 11 groups were made diabetic. Of the 22 groups, 8 groups (4 healthy and 4 diabetic) were pretreated with probiotics as described above to study their influence on gliclazide and MKC flux, 8 groups (4 healthy and 4 diabetic) were used to investigate the interaction between gliclazide and MKC during transport, and 6 groups (3 healthy and 3 diabetic) were used to study the influence of selective inhibitors of the drug transporters Mrp2, Mrp3 and Mdr1 on gliclazide flux. 10 cm piece of the ileum was removed from each rat, the underlying muscle layer and connective tissue removed and the epithelial sheets mounted into Ussing chambers. Gliclazide, MKC or a combination were added to either the mucosal or serosal side and samples collected from both sides for 3 h to determine mucosal-to-serosal absorptive flux (Jss[MtoS]) and serosal-to-mucosal secretory flux (Jss[StoM]) of gliclazide and MKC as appropriate.
In diabetic rats, gliclazide alone had no effect on blood glucose levels (Ch3, exp2) whereas MKC reduced it from 23 &#65533; 3 to 18 &#65533; 3 mmol/l (Ch3, exp3) and the combination of gliclazide and MKC reduced it even further from 24 &#65533; 4 to 16 &#65533; 3 mmol/l (Ch3, exp4). In diabetic rats, probiotic treatment reduced blood glucose by 2-fold (Ch3, exp1) and enhanced the hypoglycemic effect of the combination of gliclazide and MKC (blood glucose decreased from 24 &#65533; 3 to 10 &#65533; 2 mmol/l).
The bioavailability of gliclazide was higher in healthy rats (53.2 &#65533; 6.2%) than in diabetic rats (39.9 &#65533; 6.0%) (Ch3, exp2). In healthy rats, MKC enhanced gliclazide bioavailability (82.7 &#65533; 8.2%) but in diabetic rats MKC had no effect on gliclazide bioavailability (Ch3, exp4). In healthy rats, probiotic pretreatment significantly reduced gliclazide and MKC bioavailabilities (p&lt;0.01) while in diabetic rats, probiotic pretreatment significantly increased the low bioavailability of gliclazide to a level similar to that in healthy rats (Ch3, exp2 &amp; 3). MKC showed clear evidence of enterohepatic recycling and probiotics delayed and reduced its systemic absorption (Ch3, exp3). In ileal tissues from healthy rats, Ussing chamber studies showed gliclazide is most likely a substrate of Mrp2 and Mrp3 (Ch4, exp5) and MKC significantly reduced gliclazide Jss[MtoS] probably through Mrp3 inhibition (Ch4, exp1). In ileal tissue from diabetic rats, MKC had no effect on gliclazide Jss[MtoS] and Jss[StoM] (Ch4, exp2) and none of the inhibitors had any effect of gliclazide flux (Ch4, exp6). This suggests that these transporters are dysfunctional in this model of T1D.
Probiotics and MKC have hypoglycemic effects that appear to be enhanced by gliclazide and all appear to interact at the level of ileal drug transporters. The combination of probiotic treatment, gliclazide and MKC exerted the greatest hypoglycemic effect in T1D rats. Accordingly, the application of this combination may have potential in improving the treatment of T1D.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probiotics</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">bile acids</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">gliclazide</field><field name="subject">hypoglycemic agents</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090903.150030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical characterisation and structural determination of a novel exoglucanase</field><field name="creator">Nakatani, Yoshio</field><field name="description">Following the successful detection of novel exo-1,3-&#946;-glucanase activity from marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. BB1 that was isolated from brown algae Durvillaea sp. and its partial gene identification, the exo-glucanase (ExoP) has been purified to homogeneity. Full gene identification of exoP was achieved by Southern hybridisation using a derived probe. In total, 7612 bp of the partial Pseudoalteromonas gDNA sequence was obtained, in which 6 coding regions including the full exoP sequence were identified. The exoP gene consists of 2523 nucleotides, which is translated into 840 amino acids. The first 27 amino acids are predicted to be a signal peptide in agreement with obtained N-terminal sequence of native ExoP. The molecular weight of the mature ExoP portion was calculated to be 89320.5 Da (813 amino acids), consistent with its mobility in SDS-PAGE (87 kDa). Interestingly a putative lichenase gene (licA) whose enzymatic function is related to ExoP was located only 50 bp upstream of exoP suggesting these two genes work co-ordinately. ExoP is classified as a glycosyl hydrolase GH3 family member and is homologous with a group of bacterial and plant enzymes of which barley ExoI is the best characterised.
Following the complete gene identification, exoP was successfully cloned, over-expressed in E. coli and purified. Biochemical characterisation of ExoP revealed that the native and recombinant proteins were identical with optimal temperature 30&#65533;C and optimal pH 7.0 for hydrolase activity. ExoP showed substrate specificity towards both 1,3-&#946;- and 1,4-&#946;-glucans but did not hydrolyse aryl substrates unlike other glucosidases in the GH3 family. The ExoP was designated as an exo-1,3/1,4-&#946;-glucanase (EC. 3.2.1-.).
The crystal structure of ExoP was successfully solved at 2.45 A&#778; resolution using a two step molecular replacement procedure. ExoP was found to consist of a distinctive three domain structure: an (&#945;/&#946;)&#8328; barrel domain A, an (&#945;/&#946;)&#8326; sheet domain B and a &#946;-sandwich domain X. The catalytic pocket is formed by domains A and B and this two domain structure is highly similar to that of barley exo-1,3/1,4-&#946;-glucanase ExoI.
Three potential subsites were observed in the structure: the -1 subsite that is identical to that of barley ExoI, the +1 subsite that contains an antiparallel tryptophan clamp formed by W294 and W436, and a putative +2 subsite that involves W494. This observation agreed with the prediction by subsite mapping. The function of domain X remains unknown. However it was discovered that this domain is common in marine bacterial GH3 enzymes, and that marine bacteria also produce an independent protein that consists of the C-terminal half of this domain. The analysis of ExoP structure showed not only the conserved features of the -1 and +1 subsites of GH 3 family enzymes but new insights such as the hinge action between domains A and X, mobility of a flexible loop near the catalytic site and a possible role of domain X contributing to the enzyme fidelity.
The second part of this project focused on glycosynthase activity generated by active site mutation. While ExoP showed no such activity the Glu to Ser mutant of exo-1,3-&#946;-glucanase (Exg) from Candida albicans was functional. Albeit native Exg shows high specificity towards 1,3-&#946;-glucans, using a donor 1-fluoro-&#945;-D-glucose (1FG) and an acceptor p-nitrophenyl &#946;-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) the mutant E292S-Exg glycosynthase preferentially forms a 1,6-&#946;-linked product. In this study, the crystal structure of E292S-Exg complexed with p-nitrophenyl &#946;-gentiobioside (pNPgent), E292S-Exg/pNPgent (the product formed by the above reaction) was solved at 1.60 A&#778;. Comparison of this structure with the previously solved complexed structure, E292S-Exg/1FG/pNPG did not explain why the 1,6-linkage was favoured by this enzyme but surprisingly revealed movement of glucose at the -1 subsite, which is organised by a complex hydrogen bond network, but did not show movement of glucose in the phenylalanine clamp (the +1 subsite). The presence of an aromatic clamp (Phe-Phe in Exg or Trp-Trp as seen in ExoP) in an exo-glucanase is seen to contribute to specificity but not explain it. Glycosynthesis using other acceptor oligosaccharides was also explored in this study. Exg glycosynthase showed broad specificity using p-nitrophenyl derivatised mono-saccharides. However, it remains unknown whether this broad specificity is acceptor dependent or intrinsically due to the mutation created in Exg.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glucans</field><field name="subject">microbiological synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090930.113205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The surface characteristics of spores from thermophilic bacilli isolated from a milk powder production line and their influence on adhesion to surfaces</field><field name="creator">Seale, Richard Brent</field><field name="description">Spores of thermophilic bacilli are a common concern during the manufacture of milk powder. Spores are believed to occur in high numbers in milk powder due to their ability to survive pasteurisation, attach to stainless steel surfaces, germinate, grow as biofilms and subsequently enter the product stream and thereby contaminate the final product.
In this study, thirty one thermophilic bacilli isolates were obtained from a New Zealand milk powder production line and identified as either Anoxybacillus flavithermus or Geobacillus spp. using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and species-specific PCR. Sporulation media and a polyethylene glycol two-phase separation system were modified to produce high yields of spores free from debris.
The spores of four Geobacillus spp. isolates (CGT-8, D4, E7 and E11) were characterised in terms of structure (electron microscopy), surface charge (zeta potential), hydrophobicity (contact angle and microbial adhesion to hexadecane) and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). Spores from three of the four isolates possessed an exosporium while the fourth did not. However the integrity of the exosporium varied over time. The spores were negatively charged (-10 to -20 mV) at neutral pH and high ionic strength (0.1 M KC1). Both hydrophobicity assays revealed that the spores of the four isolates were relatively hydrophilic while ATR-IR revealed the spores' surfaces consisted of protein and polysaccharides.
The influence of these spore characteristics on adhesion to a variety of substrata under high flow rates was examined using the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. Spores generally attached in higher numbers to hydrophobic surfaces compared to hydrophilic surfaces, however this observation was more prevalent for isolate D4. This result indicated that a single mechanism could not describe the adhesion of spores from different strains.
A series of glass surfaces with modified characteristics were produced in order to test the antifouling properties on the adhesion of D4 spores. Spores suspended in a high ionic strength medium (0.1 M KC1) attached in greater numbers (1 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;) to positively charged and hydrophobic surfaces compared with negatively charged and hydrophilic surfaces. A clean in place (CIP) procedure, reduced spore numbers on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces by 1.5 and by 2.0 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;, respectively. When spores were suspended in milk, there was little difference in the number of spores attaching to the different surfaces (ie. 3.5 to 3.8 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533;), and spore removal from surfaces via a CIP regime was unchanged (1.5 to 2.0 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU cm&#8315;&#65533; reduction) compared with spores that attached in simple 1:1 electrolyte media.
The effects of a caustic wash on spore surface characteristics and adhesion was determined. There was a significant reduction in spore viability (2 Log&#8321;&#8320; CFU mL&#8315;&#65533;) after a 30 min caustic wash at 65 &#65533;C in the current study, however surviving spores displayed a greater propensity to attach to stainless steel. Surface characterisation results revealed an increase in hydrophobicity and a greater negative charge on the spores' surface after treatment with NaOH. Surviving spores could potentially recontaminate sections of the plant which are cleaned with this recycled caustic wash solution, thereby seeding surfaces with spores at the beginning of the next processing run.
In conclusion, while surfaces that reduce spore adhesion and enhance removal can be produced, exposure to complex solutions such as milk can reduce the anti-fouling effectiveness of such surfaces to spore adhesion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermophilic microorganisms</field><field name="subject">surfaces (technology)</field><field name="subject">dried milk</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="subject">microorganisms</field><field name="subject">adhesion</field><field name="subject">bacterial spores</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091001.131237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of desiccation stress on the ecophysiology of the intertidal macroalga, Stictosiphonia arbuscula, in relation to season and zonation</field><field name="creator">Loughnan, Abigale Ella</field><field name="description">Seaweeds that occupy the intertidal zone grow in distinct vertical bands. Elucidating the causes of zonation of intertidal seaweeds has been a key question for over a century, and the prevailing paradigm is that species occupying the higher shore position are limited by abiotic factors associated with exposure to atmospheric conditions, whereas for the lower-shore species competition is considered to limit a macroalga&#65533;s distribution. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of desiccation, and to a lesser extent nutrient limitation, on the distribution of Stictosiphonia arbuscula, a red intertidal seaweed that grows in a wide vertical band in the mid - high shore region. A multi-disciplinary approach was used to investigate the effect of desiccation at different functional levels, from individual cells to the whole organism. Ecophysiological comparisons were made on high-shore and low-shore populations to determine whether the upper and lower shore distributions have different abilities to tolerate and recover from desiccation stress during summer and winter. The effect of desiccation was visually assessed, using electron microscopy, at the cellular and whole organism level. Carbohydrate and pigment concentrations were determined to provide information on how S. arbuscula allocates its resources between winter and summer.
	Investigations into the ability of Stictosiphonia arbuscula to tolerate and recover photosynthetic capacity after desiccation events (relative humidity (R.H.) 5% and 40%; ranging from 30 minutes - 24 hours) unexpectedly revealed no differences between high- and low-shore specimens. However, there were seasonal differences, with summer specimens better able to recover both tissue water content and photosynthetic capacity after desiccation compared to winter specimens, especially after desiccation for 24 hours. In contrast high-shore specimens had increased rates of nitrogen uptake after mild desiccation treatments, compared to low-shore specimens during summer, and specimens from the low-shore had increased variability in their uptake rates, indicating disruption to the uptake mechanisms, compared to the high-shore specimens. S. arbuscula was able to recover photosynthetic capacity faster than nitrogen and phosphorus uptake during re-immersion after desiccation, which indicates that the ability to regain photosynthetic function may be more important for this species than regaining the ability to take up nitrogen and phosphorus. As S. arbuscula can photosynthesise in air (providing there is sufficient tissue water content) and water, the &#65533;window of opportunity&#65533; to assimilate carbon is greater than for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, which is only available to S. arbuscula during immersion at high tides. Despite this, no evidence was found of severe nutrient limitation in either high- or low-shore specimens.
	The disruption and recovery of cellular organisation during rehydration, assessed visually using electron microscopy, showed that the rate and duration of desiccation also affected the extent of recovery. Extremely desiccating conditions (R.H. 5%) damaged the cells and no recovery was observed during rehydration, compared to moderate desiccation treatments (R.H. 40%) where the time taken to recover during rehydration increased with increasing desiccation periods. The disruption of cellular organisation observed in Stictosiphonia arbuscula cells, was found to match the reduction and / or disruption to photosynthesis and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus under similar desiccation regimes. The formation of ridges and depressions on the surface of the tissue was also observed during desiccation, which is thought to help reduce the rate of evaporation by trapping &#65533;pockets&#65533; of air.
	Finally, Stictosiphonia arbuscula is extremely well suited to the mid - high region in the intertidal zone and it can maximise its competitive ability within this niche during immersion by fully rehydrating within 10 minutes, regaining maximum photosynthetic capacity within 20 minutes, and stability of nutrient uptake rates within 90 minutes. Further, S. arbuscula has higher rates of photosynthesis in winter, associated with increased photosynthetic pigment concentrations at this time. In contrast, during summer, the photosynthetic rates, chlorophyll a and phycobiliprotein concentrations are reduced and S. arbuscula increases its allocation of resources into protective mechanisms such as UV-absorbing compounds.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine algae</field><field name="subject">intertidal macroalga</field><field name="subject">Stictosiphonia arbuscula</field><field name="subject">ecophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20051020.182823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School based assessment within a standards based assessment regime : a mathematics community&#65533;s perspective</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Robert K.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a project with the overarching aim of exploring the role of School Based Assessment (SBA) in mathematics as a component alongside external written examinations for qualifications. The research was carried out in New Zealand during the implementation of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). The NCEA was implemented in 2002. The NCEA is targeted at three levels: Level 1 for Year 11 (fifth form) to replace the School Certificate Examinations (SC); Level 2 for Year 12 (sixth form) to replace Sixth Form Certificate Examinations (SFC) and; Level 3 for Year 13 (seventh form) to replace University Bursaries (UB). The NCEA uses standards based methods of assessment as opposed to its predecessors (SC, SFC, and UB) which used norm referenced methods of assessment. The examination at each level is divided into internal and external assessments. The internal assessment called Internal Achievement Standards (assessed by teachers in schools) is an SBA component. It is this component of the NCEA Level 1 examination which formed the focus of the study. A qualitative approach was used in the research through interviews, school visits part of which involved participant observation in assessment situations, and participant observations at professional development (PD) workshops for teachers. Four different groups of participants were interviewed for this research: policy-makers at the New Zealand Ministry of Education (MoE) and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA), The Mathematics Expert Panel, the facilitators of professional development (PD) workshops for teachers, and teachers of NCEA Level 1 mathematics. A total of 58 persons were interviewed. The perspective of each of these groups was necessary since each group had its specific role to play in the implementation of the NCEA. The policy-makers were asked to articulate the rationale for the SBA component of the NCEA. The Mathematics Expert Panel, which had decided on the areas of the secondary school mathematics best suited for SBA were asked to explain how this was done. The facilitators of the PD workshops recounted their experiences as they facilitated the teachers on how to assess against standards. Teachers who had the role of practical implementation were asked to articulate what they thought the rationale for an SBA was. They were also asked about the issues they confronted and the challenges they faced as they were introduced to a new regime of assessment. Both policy-makers and teachers are agreed that the rationale for an SBA component is to assess those objectives of the curriculum which are not appropriately, adequately and validly assessed in an external examination. A Framework was developed to gauge suitability of topics in the secondary school&#65533;s curriculum for SBA. The topics of the secondary curriculum found to be best suited for SBA are some parts of Geometry and Trigonometry, Measurement, and Statistics and Probability. The findings of this research provide adequate evidence that SBA has the potential for making a wider range of the school mathematics curriculum open to assessment. School Based Assessment also has the potential to get teachers at the secondary level to use pedagogical approaches that they rarely use when they teach for external examinations only. Facilitators of the PD workshops and the teachers of NCEA mathematics were of the opinion that the NCEA was too hurriedly implemented. Teachers confronted many teething problems and had many concerns during the first year of implementation. However, after three years, most of the teachers believe that the concerns they had during the first year are no longer issues for worry. There are implications for education systems wishing to implement innovative ideas that place heavy demands on teachers. The results here suggest that teachers need time before they are expected to change their normal manner of doing things in school. If adequate time is given at the initial stages then the process become a bit less hectic for them.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National Certificate of Educational Achievement</field><field name="subject">NCEA</field><field name="subject">eduational tests and measurements</field><field name="subject">mathematics</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">education standards</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz/public/adt-NZDU20060516.112442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sheep mandibular animal models for dental implantology research</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Warwick John</field><field name="description">This inquiry investigated the suitability of the jaw of domestic sheep as an animal model for dental implantology research. Initially, parameters for osseous healing of critical size defects (CSD) in the sheep mandible were established. Pilot studies were conducted using machined-surface implants and a surgical protocol established for dental implant placement in ovine mandibular sites. Subsequent experiments considered the utility of this animal model for examination of techniques designed to enhance osseointegration. Hydroxyapatite-coated implants were compared with titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) implants, either alone or combined with autogenous bone grafts or a bone graft/collagen vehicle loaded with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#946;). Immunofluorescent bone labelling gave information on the mineral apposition rate (MAR). Implant survival and "acceptability" (likelihood of clinical success) were major output variables, along with histomorphometric analysis of percent bone-implant contact (%BIC) and percent peri-implant bone density (%density). Naturally-occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis in sheep was identified as a potential confounder. Subsequent experiments considered implants with different surfaces. The model was also extended from a two-stage surgical protocol to include single-stage implants. The effect of pre-existing ovine peridontitis was also examined. A systematic review and meta-analysis of published animal implant experiments was conducted in order to validate the candidate sheep model.
	Major findings were as follows. The size of non-healing sheep mandibular unicortical CSD is &gt;12mm. Attempts to establish a chronic non-healing CSD were unsuccessful. The sheep diastema proved unsuitable for implant placement. The model was modified to a post-extraction protocol. Implant "acceptability" rates after 3 months integration in the sheep mandible (defined as implant survival with %BIC &gt;10%) ranged from 50% - 100% for different implant surface treatments and placement protocols. Histomorphometriic analyses revealed that %BIC ranged from 11 &#65533; 17% to 81 &#65533; 29 % for different titanium surfaces and up to 85 &#65533; 11% for hydroxyapatite surfaces. Implants with TGF-&#946; plus autogenous bone grafts had %BIC of 36 &#65533; 30% compared with 43 &#65533; 30% for implants with grafts alone. Bone per unit area (%density) adjacent to, but outside of the implant threads, ranged from 63 &#65533; 16% to 86 &#65533; 3% and was markedly lower for titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces and for one-stage implants. Within the implant threads, %density varied from 31 &#65533; 33% to 73.4 &#65533; 8.3%, and was markedly lower for machined titanium surfaces. Sheep periodontitis had little effect on the protocols investigated. The sheep mandibular model was found to be comparable to similar models in other species and merits further development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental implants</field><field name="subject">mandible</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">animal models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.144214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adverse drug events and medication errors in a paediatric inpatient population</field><field name="creator">Kunac, Desir&#233;e L.</field><field name="description">Background. Medication-related patient injuries (adverse drug events, ADEs) are an important problem in all hospitalised populations; however, the potential for injury is reported to be greater in children than adults. Many ADEs are due to error and therefore could be prevented. Data regarding the risk factors (or predictors) for these events in paediatric inpatients is limited. It was hypothesised that "identification of risk factors for ADEs and medication errors in the paediatric inpatient setting will inform likely prevention strategies".
	Aims. To determine the frequency, nature and risk factors for ADEs and potential ADEs occurring in a paediatric inpatient population; to assess the vulnerable processes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) medication use process; and to provide recommendations for the targeting of likely prevention strategies.
	Setting. A general paediatric ward (PW), postnatal ward (PNW) and NICU of a University- affiliated urban general hospital.
	Design. There were two study components: the medEVENT study which involved identification of actual ADEs and potential ADEs over a twelve week period, through prospective review of medical records, medication charts and administration records along with voluntary and solicited staff report and parent interview; and the FMEA study which used a proactive risk assessment technique, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to rank all potential failures in the NICU medication use process according to risk.
	Results. In the MedEVENT study 3160 prescription episodes were reviewed (which represented 520 admissions, 3037 patient-days) and revealed a total of 67 ADEs and 77 potential ADEs. The greatest number of events occurred in NICU with very few events in the PNW. However, paediatric surgical admissions experienced the highest rate of ADEs per 1000 patient-days (80) as compared to medical (65) then NICU admissions (19). Over half of the ADEs were deemed preventable, 38 (57%), with the &#65533;more serious&#65533; ADEs more likely to be preventable than &#65533;not serious&#65533; ADEs. The impact on hospital resources was considerable with the cost attributed to extra bed days due to ADEs to be $NZD 50,000. Dosing errors were the most common type of error, particularly when prescribing and administering medications. Antibacterial and narcotic analgesics were commonly implicated, as was the intravenous route of administration. Few events were related to unlicensed use of medications.
	For ADEs, the major risk factors when analysed by admission, were greater medication exposure and increasing age; by prescription, were increasing age, oral route and narcotics and antibacterial agents; for paediatric ward admission, were increasing age and increased length of stay; and for NICU admission, no major risk factors emerged. For potential ADEs, the major risk factors when analysed by admission were greater medication exposure; by prescription, were junior prescriber, intravenous route, narcotics and antibacterials; for paediatric ward admission, were junior prescriber and narcotics; and for NICU admission were antibacterials, electrolytes and umbilical venous catheter administration. Neither ADEs nor potential ADEs were associated with unlicensed use of medicines or high alert status drugs.
	The FMEA study identified 72 potential failures in the NICU medication use process with 193 associated causes and effects. Multiple failures were possible in the process of &#65533;prescribing medication&#65533; and in the process of &#65533;preparation of medication for administration&#65533;. The highest ranking issues were found to occur at the administration stage. Common potential failures related to errors in the dose, timing of administration, infusion pump settings and route of administration.
	Conclusions. Analysis of the risk factors of ADEs and potential ADEs found that the most vulnerable processes were when prescribing and when preparing a medicine for administration; especially when involving narcotic and antibacterial agents and for children with greater medication exposure Strategies that selectively target these high risk areas are therefore likely to have the greatest impact on preventing drug-related injuries in hospitalised children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pediatric pharmacology</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">side effects of drugs</field><field name="subject">medication errors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060707.161220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating dual tasking ability following traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Tracy</field><field name="description">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently associated with both cognitive and behavioural executive dysfunction. Assessment of executive dysfunction has traditionally been measured using tests that were not based on theory and this has been postulated as one reason why there are poor predictive relationships between performance on traditional executive tasks and functional outcome following TBI. Baddeley&#65533;s (1996) working memory model may offer a theoretical basis with which to design new executive measures and possibly improve prediction of outcome. Baddeley&#65533;s theory has made recent advances in identifying core central executive (CE) processes that are likely to be relevant to TBI. 
 The research presented in the thesis used Baddeley&#65533;s proposed coordinative sub function of the CE (and it related dual tasking measure) to assess: (a) whether this theoretically based dual tasking test would be sensitive to TBI injury status and show a significant relationship with functional outcome, (b) whether the theoretically based test would be more sensitive to the above relationships than executive measures that have been traditionally available, and (c) whether more ecologically relevant dual tasks could be developed that reflect the coordinative construct and improve predictive relationships between task performance and real life functional ability. 
 This study found that Baddeley&#65533;s Dual Task Test (DTT) measure was sensitive to TBI injury and was related to functional outcome following injury. A questionnaire assessing everyday dual tasking ability was developed as was an in vivo conversation and motor based dual task. The dual tasking questionnaire reflected Baddeley&#65533;s coordinative construct, however, applications to an in vivo conversation and motor based dual task were less successful. These ecologically relevant tasks showed a relationship between language dysfluencies and dual tasking and identified avoidance of dual tasking in everyday settings as an important predictor of functional outcome following injury. Overall the DTT and the dual tasking questionnaire showed greater injury sensitivity and stronger relationships with outcome than three executive measures traditionally used in clinical practice. Regression analysis confirmed that the dual based tasks were helpful in predicting a variety of outcomes following TBI, and implications for rehabilitation planning are discussed. Further increases in the predictive power of the dual tasking construct are likely to be achieved when mechanisms of action involved in both laboratory-based and real-life dual tasking are identified. Findings from the current study suggest a range of mechanisms could be involved in dual tasks and these are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alan D.

A qualitative method was employed, using individual interviews with 22 parents and 8 children from 15 families, in three court districts, during 2001-2002. Follow-up interviews were also conducted with the parents one year later to assess the factors affecting compliance with their agreements and court orders. Focus groups were held with 16 Family Court professionals (lawyers, counsellors, specialist report writers and judges) in two cities to obtain their views on the family members&#65533; perspectives. 
 Sociocultural and ecological theories, the sociology of childhood and the UNCRC provided the conceptual basis for the research. Historical developments in child custody and divorce laws, which provided the impetus for the establishment of Family Courts internationally, have also been reviewed. 
 Each parent was legally represented, with 87% of the families also attending Family Court counselling and judge-led mediation conferences. Defended hearings occurred in 27% of the cases. Family members reported a broad range of views about their legal and court experiences. They valued their interactions with professionals who took an interest in them and their children, provided clear information and support, let them have their say, and competently managed the dispute resolution processes. Dissatisfaction was frequently expressed with the conduct of ex-partners and with professionals&#65533; styles of practice, particularly where these involved erratic or uncompromising attitudes and adversarial tactics. The desire to respond to what was written in an ex-partner&#65533;s affidavit escalated some parenting disputes onto a litigation pathway. Delay, cost, gender bias, lack of enforcement of court orders, and inadequate opportunities to feel heard, understood and respected were also identified as problems associated with Family Court proceedings. Earlier access to a wider range of information, support and conciliation services was recommended, together with more post-order explanation and support. 
 The professionals wanted a stronger emphasis on the Family Court as a court of law, rather than a social agency. A clearer demarcation between the court&#65533;s conciliation and adjudication functions was considered necessary to avoid clients having unrealistic expectations of the Family Court. Family members&#65533; therapeutic needs were important, but thought best met within community-based agencies. 
 The children were aware of their parents&#65533; court proceedings and most wanted the opportunity to play a more direct role in the decision about their future living arrangements. 
 Significant or modest changes had occurred in 60% of the families by the time of their follow-up interviews. Some changes had led to a reversal in the original care arrangements, while others had impacted upon the frequency of a child&#65533;s contact with their non-resident parent. 
 A new conceptual model for the resolution of post-separation parenting disputes has been developed. This integrates the theoretical framework underpinning the study with the international research evidence on the impact of parental separation and the principles and practices of an effective child-inclusive and culturally responsive family law system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Family Court</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">public opinion</field><field name="subject">domestic relations courts</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution law</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060810.120428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Thakur, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is a technique used in the field of assisted reproduction. The technique is applied to embryos that have been created in vitro, in order to facilitate the selection of embryos according to particular genetic parameters. The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis by prospective parents at high risk for having a child affected by a genetic disorder has facilitated the birth of unaffected children. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis has already been used for other purposes, such as screening for gender, and could in principle be used to screen for a wide range of genetic traits. The aim of this thesis is to provide good answers to the ethical questions provoked by the advent and continuing development of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 
 The thesis is divided into four parts. Part One provides a brief overview of the science of genetic selection. Part Two is centred on a discussion of two ethical principles. The principle of procreative liberty is based upon the idea that acts of interference in the reproductive lives of others should be avoided unless there is good justification for such acts. The principle of procreative beneficence is based upon the idea that prospective parents should select the child, of the possible children they could have, who is expected to have the best life. I will argue that the principle of procreative liberty should be applied to acts of interference in individuals&#65533; freedom to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis, while the principle of procreative beneficence should be applied to acts of selecting children. 
 In Part Three, I will endorse a position that accords embryos a relatively low moral status, reject the arguments of the disability rights critique, argue that the eugenic aspects of preimplantation genetic diagnosis do not warrant much concern, and develop a framework for critically evaluating slippery slope arguments. Finally, in Part Four, specific applications of preimplantation genetic diagnosis will be examined in detail. Although each application raises unique ethical questions, this thesis aims to demonstrate that the consistent application of the principles and preliminary conclusions developed in Parts Two and Three provides the best means for determining how PGD should be used and which uses should be restricted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">preimplantation genetic diagnosis</field><field name="subject">human reproductive technology</field><field name="subject">medical genetics</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="subject">moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060816.105106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress fractures : ethics and the provision of sports medicine at the elite level in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Lynley Carol</field><field name="description">The provision of medical care to top-level athletes in New Zealand comes with a number of challenging ethical issues. Some of these arise out of the commercial interest present in sport that links sporting success with funding, sponsorship deals and media interest. The requirement that athletes stay at peak physical function in order to be successful can, at times, be at odds with concepts of well-being and good health. The employment structure under which doctors are engaged by teams and the employment contracts which define these relationships can be the source of divided loyalty for doctors. For example, sharing health information beyond the doctor-athlete relationship may be in line with contractual obligations, but at odds with what the athlete requests. Divided loyalties also exist when athletes wish to participate in sport despite high risk of harm. Here there is a difference between what the doctor understands as the athlete&#65533;s best interest, and the athlete&#65533;s consideration of best interest. 
 This thesis adopts two strategies for examining the area of sports medicine in elite athletes in New Zealand. The first section utilizes qualitative research. Sixteen sports doctors were interviewed and the data analysed. The next section involves normative reflection. Here two issues (where a range of behaviours were exhibited by participants) selected from the data are considered and discussion is presented on how doctors should respond to these issues. An examination of the level of guidance offered to sports doctors from the Australasian College of Sports Physician&#65533;s Code of Ethics follows. The level of guidance offered is considered inadequate and the thesis ends with a call to attend to these concerns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australasian College of Sports Physicians Code of Ethics</field><field name="subject">sports medicine</field><field name="subject">medical ethics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand contracts</field><field name="subject">compromise (law)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060911.150036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical analysis of the relationships between nursing, medicine and the government in New Zealand 1984-2001</field><field name="creator">Miles, Mary Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns an investigation of the tripartite arrangements between the government, the nursing and the medical sectors in New Zealand over the period 1984 to 2001 with a particular focus on primary health care. The start point is the commencement of the health reforms instituted by the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government of 1984. The thesis falls within a framework of critical inquiry, specifically, the methodology of depth hermeneutics (Thompson, 1990), a development of critical theory. 
 The effects of political and economic policies and the methodologies of neo-liberal market reform are examined together with the concept of collaboration as an ideological symbolic form, typical of enterprise culture. 
 The limitations of economic models such as public choice theory, agency theory and managerialism are examined from the point of view of government strategies and their effects on the relationships between the nursing and medical professions. 
 The influence of American health care policies and their partial introduction into primary health care in New Zealand is traversed in some detail, together with the experiences of health reform in several other countries. 
 Post election 1999, the thesis considers the effect of change of political direction consequent upon the election of a Labour Coalition government and concludes that the removal of the neo-liberal ethic by Labour may terminate entrepreneurial opportunities in the nursing profession. The thesis considers the effects of a change to Third Way political direction on national health care policy and on the medical and nursing professions. The data is derived from various texts and transcripts of interviews with 12 health professionals and health commentators. 
 The histories and current relationships between the nursing and medical professions are examined in relation to their claims to be scientific discourses and it is argued that the issue of lack of recognition as a scientific discourse is at the root of nursing&#65533;s perceived inferiority to medicine. This is further expanded in a discussion at the end of the thesis where the structure of the two professions is compared and critiqued. A conclusion is drawn that a potential for action exists to remedy the deficient structure of nursing. The thesis argues that this is the major issue which maintains nursing in the primary sector in a perceived position of inferiority to medicine. 
 The thesis also concludes that the role of government in this triangular relationship is one of manipulation to bring about necessary fundamental change in the delivery of health services at the lowest possible cost without materially strengthening the autonomy of the nursing or the medical professions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical policy</field><field name="subject">health services administration</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">nurse administrators</field><field name="subject">New Zealand government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.145605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Similarities and differences in New Zealand school uniforms : issues of identity</field><field name="creator">Webster, Elaine Irene</field><field name="description">Dress and appearance constitute the visual realm in the dialectic of identity construction and are powerful communicators in this process, since dress and appearance are the symbolic means by which we locate ourselves and others through interaction within social contexts. Dress is used to differentiate and create boundaries for group belonging and exclusion, and in the uniform has been understood to have a capacity to suppress individuality and to identify the wearer with objectives beyond the self. Adolescence is a time of intense identity work and in New Zealand coincides with secondary schooling during which school uniforms are usually worn. Is freedom in dress necessary for development of personal identity? 
 The effects of same-dressing on identity development in adolescence were investigated in the context of the history, practice, and meanings of school uniform in New Zealand secondary schools. This was investigated through a nationwide survey, analysis of selected school photographs and records, interviews with students, review of legal and bureaucratic structures supporting the practice, and review of the literature of school uniforms, and education and social history of New Zealand. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods contributed to analysis of both dress practices in wider New Zealand contexts, and more personal use of dress in the formation of personal identity. Analysis of school uniforms as mechanisms of power, constituting both the student and the self, drew on symbolic interactionist theory and on Foucault&#65533;s later interpretations of power, while also linking material culture and social structures. 
 New Zealand has a strong and continuing tradition of school uniform in secondary schools, yet this practice is characterised by change, variety, and differences, challenging the sameness which uniforms are supposed to embody. Meanings and functions of uniforms have changed considerably over the twentieth century, evolving through extreme and diverse expressions of the expectations of social, political, and education systems towards their young people, and mediated in turn by students themselves. While school uniforms both manifest and mediate the power of the school over the bodies of children, the power embodied in uniforms is not always and only a repressive power, but is also a generative, productive power. Students described uniforms as a form of shelter and protection, embodying belonging and participation in the school and a projected future of success and engagement in adult society and work. Uniforms also maintained a breadth of possibilities consistent with a fluid class system and egalitarian ideals of New Zealand society. 
 While students believed self-expression essential for the formation of a self, they believed this need could be met through the use of minor differences in uniforms, while uniforms allowed them to retain the advantages of group belonging. Schools allowing some personal expression effectively strengthened the sense of belonging and participation, by maintaining the individual in positive relation to the group. The interaction that creates a self consists in symbols, involving meanings, appearances, and communication: differences and similarities from part of these complex interactions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">uniforms</field><field name="subject">clothing and dress</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061108.143726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of fruit traits in Coprosma and the subtribe Coprosminae</field><field name="creator">Markey, Adrienne Selina</field><field name="description">The flora of New Zealand has evolved largely in the absence of terrestrial mammals, the predominant frugivore guilds being birds and reptiles. The evolution of divergent fruit traits in New Zealand may be a consequence of different selection pressure by these two guilds, and two contrasting putative dispersal syndromes have been proposed for New Zealand fleshy fruited plants. Coprosma (Rubiaceae: subtribe Coprosminae) is a speciose and morphologically diverse genus, which is distributed throughout the South Pacific and which also produces variably coloured drupes. It was selected as a model genus to investigate the evolution of fruit traits within this context. For this purpose, a molecular phylogeny for the subtribe Coprosminae and Coprosma was inferred using parsimony, likelihood and split decomposition analysis on sequences from the 16rps intron of cpDNA and ETS and ITS region of nrDNA. Up to 32 species were included in the subtribal analyses, whilst 53 species of Coprosma were used in subgeneric studies. The basis for the variety of fruit colours seen in New Zealand was determined using histology and pigment extractions. To test the assumption that fruit traits among species evolved in concert under selection from frugivore guilds, fruit shape, size and nutrient composition were determined in order to test predictions that these would co-vary with fruit colour. 
 In the Coprosminae, fleshy drupes have arisen from dry fruited schizocarps and with two possible reversals to semi-dry drupes. Within Coprosma, fruit colour was found to be evolutionarily labile and varied both among and within lineages, particularly within two main groups where fruit colour had shifted from orange to blue and white, or red, pink and black colours respectively. The evolution of novel (non-orange) fruit colours was restricted to New Zealand, as was the small-leaved, divaricate growth form, the combination of which has been associated with a putative reptile dispersal syndrome. Several trans-oceanic dispersals out of New Zealand were also inferred from the phylogeny, these extending into Australia, New Guinea and Hawai&#65533;i. In these instances, fruit colour did not appear change markedly after establishment in a new country. Within New Zealand, fruit sizes were found to vary with colour as predicted, although the majority of species produced small (&lt; 8 mm), elliptical fruits. There was no clear association between fruit colour and fruit nutrient composition. It would appear that these small, succulent, carbohydrate-rich and lipid-poor fruits cater to a wide range of generalist frugivores. 
 The variety of fruit colours in Coprosma stemmed from qualitative and quantitative differences in carotenoid and anthocyanin composition. The genetic basis for the control of these pathways is currently unknown, but it is assumed that a few regulatory genes can control a substantial amount of phenotypic variation. Considering the evolutionary history of Coprosma, it would appear that a history of recent and rapid speciation, hybridisation and reticulate evolution may have increased the tempo of fruit colour evolution in the genus.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coprosma</field><field name="subject">Rubiaceae</field><field name="subject">New Zealand ecology</field><field name="subject">plant phylogeny</field><field name="subject">fruit genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061206.160155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The identification of mathematical ability and of factors significant in its nurture</field><field name="creator">Daniel, Coralie</field><field name="description">This thesis reports data gathered through case studies of ten of the students who took part in a survey of secondary school students who had been invited to camps at which the New Zealand teams were chosen for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the first five years of this country&#65533;s participation in the IMO. The case studies data gave individuals&#65533; narratives that were captivating yet complex, unique yet universal, clear yet not easily described all of apiece. I read widely in response to the information they offered and found that reflection and a narrative style of presentation assisted the grasping of nuances and implications of the students&#65533; narratives. 
 Few of the parents of the students were particularly competent in mathematics or able to account for their child&#65533;s curiosity, concentration and skills in pursuing a fascination with number. In most of the families, all members were encouraged to follow their own inclinations and interests, to respect the maintenance of a balance of cultural and physical activities, to regard books and play as normal life supports, and to believe that discovery, enchantment and pleasure were both goals and accomplishments of everyday life. 
 Most of the students experienced less encouragement at school than they might have expected, and unpleasant experiences could be linked with a teacher&#65533;s apparent lack of appreciation of a student&#65533;s mathematical ability. Both the case studies and the initial survey suggested that most teachers, at any level of formal education, were doing all they were capable of doing in mathematics, and that the students responded to opportunities to self-select subjects and topics that interested them and to the help and company offered by mentors and peers who had flair and competence in appropriate subject areas. 
 Few of the case studies students were motivated by strategies dependent on a high level of competition or a 'sorting' of that offered in formal education (through attitudes and practical organisation such as timetabling) into either Arts or Science subjects. Most were attracted to the study of languages and/or philosophy and some to that of computer science. Most showed interest and some prowess in individual cultural and physical activities requiring perseverance. Largely, they were motivated by finding fresh or novel ways of integrating diverse knowledge, and by associating with peers. They enjoyed and valued self-awareness, intellectual independence, chances to empathise with ideas and people, and tasks that were in harmony with the dictates of their own volition. 
 Evidence of differences among the case studies students - even though they had all been identified as very able in mathematics - led me to Vadim Krutetskii&#65533;s theories of the components of mathematical ability and their functioning and thus to new views, first, of the interplay between aptitude and languages of perception, inner comprehension and outer expression and, second, of the relationships between giftedness and other attributes of human abilities and endeavours. These appreciations suggested that the models of education and support commonly exhibited in the case studies students&#65533; families and in the environments of their extra-school activities had been more encouraging of their gifts, talents and personal growth than those often exhibited in the schools they attended.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical ability</field><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">psychology of learning</field><field name="subject">International Mathematical Olympiad</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070212.105323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Load-bearing structures : Pakeha identity and the cross-cultural poetry of James K. Baxter and Glenn Colquhoun</field><field name="creator">Dennison, John Sebastian</field><field name="description">Pakeha identity has long been problematic, caught in a straddling stance between European co-ordinates of origin, and life in Aotearoa. This has been particularly evident over the last three decades: with the rise of tino rangatiratanga, Pakeha identity has undergone something of a crisis. Group identity, especially in such periods of crisis, requires &#65533;narratives&#65533; that re-imagine being and belonging. Poetry by Pakeha both displays the problem with identity at the cross cultural threshold between Maori and Pakeha, asking &#65533; what happens when Pakeha engage cross-culturally with te ao Maori, appropriating te reo Maori and drawing on Maoritanga, to re-vision and reconfigure identity? And how does such an approach shape the imagining of Pakeha identity?&#65533;
	I study, in parallel, the cross-cultural poetry of James K. Baxter and Glen Colquhoun in relation to these questions. Borrowing a conceptual metaphor from Colin McCahon, I examine these cross-cultural poems in detail as &#65533;load-bearing structures&#65533;. I pay particular attention to the way in which, in purpose, design and materials, they function to re-imagine Pakeha identity in reciprocal relationship with te ao Maori. Aware of the problems of culture-crossing, at the outset I establish a historical and interpretive framework for the poetry. Furthermore, I discuss the question of appropriation, arguing for an ethical distinction between appropriation and misappropriation based on a cross-cultural relationship of faithful and reciprocal engagement.
	I conclude that Baxter and Colquhoun are singular and radical in their reconfiguration of Pakeha identity. Baxter embraces te ao Maori in a direct challenge to Pakeha nationalism, prescribing the necessary corrective of the tuakana-teina dynamic to Pakeha identity and its relationship with te ao Maori. Writing after the Maori renaissance, Glenn Colquhoun irreverently opens up a further reconfiguration of cross-cultural relationship, pushing both Maori and Pakeha beyond a cultural dichotomy towards a mutually defining complementarity. Both place themselves on the cultural threshold of language, embracing the tensions of the cross-cultural scenario. The result is cross-cultural poetry, load-bearing structures that manifest the tension and ambivalence of the settler culture&#65533;s straddling identity, enacting what it is to be Pakeha.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">James K.

The correlation of museum artefacts and ethno-historical descriptions</field><field name="creator">Purdue, Carla J</field><field name="description">The rhizome of the bracken fern was an important part of the subsistence base of the pre-contact Maori of Aotearoa. It provided an essential source of starch - especially to the southern Maori, who relied mainly upon wild resources for the vegetable component of their diet. The preparation of the rhizome (or fern-root) for consumption necessitated the beating of the cooked root upon a smooth stone anvil. The implement that was used to beat the fern-root is an important Maori tool which, until now, has had little detailed attention paid to it. Therefore, the aim of this research was to characterize the form of the fern-beater using morphological attributes. Through the combination of a comprehensive literature review of enthographic-historical accounts and more contemporary documentary research, along with a nationwide survey of implements labelled as "fern-root beaters" in museum collections, this thesis identifies a number of critical and common attributes that are inherent in a beating implement. It was found that wooden and stone beaters/pounders were dissimilar in size and proportions, with the majority of wooden implements displayed larger circumference dimensions, were shorter and considerably heavier, thus casting some doubt on their practicality as a beating implement. Four distinct morphological forms were identified for both the wooden and stone items surveyed, and it was found that metric variables were more significant in suggesting function than non-metric. Regional distribution analysis of the survey implements highlighted a northern North Island predominance, particularly in the Northland, Auckland, Taranaki and Waikato regions. A tenuous comparison with Simpson&#65533;s distribution of prehistoric dental attrition known as "fern-root plane" showed a loose regional correlation, however; the actual cause of this tooth wear is still a hotly contested issue.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">Rarauhe</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">excavations</field><field name="subject">implements</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.135954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The meaning of home as it becomes a place for care : the emergence of a new life stage for frail older people? : a study in the dynamics of home care for older people</field><field name="creator">Hale, Beatrice</field><field name="description">This work is a study of the day to day experiences of older people in receipt of in-home care, the experiences of their family carers, and of their careworkers, resulting in a hypothesis about the structure of the lifecycle towards the end of life, and a consideration of both structured transition and individual transitions to and within this life stage. It has taken off from Laslett&#65533;s (1989,1996) seminal work on age divisions, into Third and Fourth Ages. 
 Through an initial examination of secondary sources, I have hypothesized that the older people in this care bracket are in fact in a new life stage, between that of the independent Third Age and the dependent Fourth Age. I call this life stage the stage of 'Supported Independence'. Further references to the secondary sources, and references to the data, have supported this hypothesis, and have shown that there is a structured transition from the stage of independence to that of supported independence. 
 The value of building such a life stage lies in the ability we then have to emphasize the situation of in-home care, bringing to prominence the experiences of the three stakeholders in this care environment. 
 I have used the rites of passage concept to make known the issues involving the move from independence to dependence and those issues predominant in receiving in-home care, in being the carer at such a time, and in being the careworker within the invisibility of home. This has shown a formalized separation from the independent identity, and a prolonged stage of liminality because of an often uncertain form of service delivery. In this liminal stage also are revealed the emotions of living at home with a disability and with care, the improvisatory practices, the passivity and the assertiveness of this time of ageing. 
 By applying this concept also to the family carers, I show the movement of families into and through the caring role, the joy of caring and the difficulties of taking responsibility without authority. I have shown carers&#65533; own improvisatory practices, and their determination to maintain the care recipient at home as long as possible. 
 For the careworker, the rites of passage concept shows how she (and the careworker participants in this study are all women), can act to either maintain the liminal position of the recipients or assist in their reconnection to greater autonomy. Exploring the careworkers&#65533; own positions by means of the rites of passage concept highlights their inter-structural position between the public and private sectors, and highlights too, the care industry&#65533;s position, between that of a time managed industry and a recipient-directed industry. Whether this can be regarded as liminal depends on the philosophies of care adopted by the industry. 
 In summary, the study examines the significance of the place of care, challenging the dominant ideology that home is best, and putting forward for consideration principles of care for other models of service delivery.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">frail elderly</field><field name="subject">home care</field><field name="subject">home nursing</field><field name="subject">human life cycle</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">dependency (psychology) in old age</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070402.143208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance management : an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Carolyn Patricia</field><field name="description">The dynamic nature of performance management is a significant issue for organisations. A review of the empirical performance management literature highlights that little research has examined an organisation&#65533;s holistic performance management framework. Most prior studies have been partial (i.e., examine various performance management elements), and there is a lack of depth in analysis (because of the short-term nature of many studies). In addition to the few studies that have examined the interconnections between the performance management elements, there has also been a lack of research examining incentive systems (especially at lower levels), target-setting, and performance evaluation. The literature review in this thesis also highlights the diversity in the performance management elements studied, the lack of theoretical development, diversity in who is interviewed and research sites, etc. This diversity in field study research provides a difficult base on which to build a cumulative body of literature (as most studies examine a different research question in a different context). 
 This PhD research examines the overall performance management framework in a large and complex Australasian organisation, Sensol, over a 14 year period. The research is inductive, empirical and interpretative so as to gain a deeper understanding of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework. The narrative highlights the multiple voices that exist in Sensol to illustrate the complexity of performance management at various levels. Otley&#65533;s (1999) performance management framework is a useful research tool (e.g., initial data analysis, structuring device). 
 The documentary evidence traces the history and development of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework. The designers&#65533; story tells about the sophisticated nature of Sensol&#65533;s approach to performance management. In contrast, the business unit managers describe the complexities in operationalising performance management in a complex, diversified and decentralised organisation. 
 The researcher&#65533;s story explains the importance of understanding the highly interconnected nature of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework and of understanding the behavioural issues (e.g., intense sibling rivalry, short-termism). It includes the importance of history, context (e.g., hierarchical culture), decentralised structure (e.g., interrelated business units), the trade-offs between financial and social objectives (and signalling effect of weightings), performance measurement issues (e.g., EVA&#65533;, scorecard, dominance of EBIT, transfer pricing), the subjectivity of objective setting and performance management processes (e.g., averaging, little differentiation between good and poor performers), problems with the annual incentive scheme (e.g., double dipping, risk and penalties, lack of understanding and line of sight, low trust), strategic programmes (e.g., lack of visibility), target-setting (e.g., conservative targets, impact of capping), and information flows (i.e., poor data, black boxes). 
 The research also highlights the importance of understanding how the formal and informal performance management systems operate. There are considerable differences between the designers&#65533; rhetoric on the formal HPMF system (i.e., the intended design), compared to the system in use (e.g., formal and informal systems). This point has been recognised in some prior field studies but is an under-researched area. An understanding of the impact of the background to the performance management literature from classical management theory provides some insights into why the value-based management literature focuses on formal system design control tools, goal congruence, top-down focus, and the universal applicability of their techniques. Ignoring informal systems may be one reason that the traditional control problems remain evident with the new value-based management techniques. 
 A final contribution of this PhD research is to use historical documents to identify how little change there has been over time and how performance management issues keep going around in circles (e.g., lack of accountability, transfer pricing). Some reasons for these circles include that history is lost, complacency, culture, communication issues (e.g., good news, blocking behaviours, standardisation). A feature of Sensol&#65533;s performance management framework is how it used EVA&#65533; and the balanced scorecard in a complementary manner. However, rather than adopting these new techniques as prescribed by consultants, Sensol built these new techniques onto their existing performance management system. This highlights the importance of understanding the history of an organisation&#65533;s performance management framework, so as to understand the reasons for the current design and operation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">personnel management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.145211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abused children in New Zealand/Aotearoa : presentation and investigation</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Kay Helen</field><field name="description">The overarching goal of the present research was to identify the interface between research and practice in the area of child-abuse investigation. The specific aims of the research were to explore how abused children present to investigators, to identify the characteristics of the children&#65533;s disclosures and the role of disclosure in the investigation, to establish the factors that influenced child-abuse investigators&#65533; decisions to interview children, and to make comparisons between sexually- and physically-abused children. Three hundred substantiated cases of child abuse (150 sexual-abuse and 150 physical-abuse investigations) investigated by the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services of New Zealand, prior to July 2001, were analysed. 
 Children were most often physically-abused by their biological parents, and mothers were marginally more often the abusers than were fathers. The most common indicators of physical abuse were children&#65533;s disclosures and physical injuries. Risk factors for physical abuse included living in two-parent households and being of Maori or Pacific Island ethnicity. Gender or age provided no protection from physical abuse. The families of the physically-abused children were characterised by family violence, substance abuse, neglect, and poor mental health. Adverse family circumstances restrained children from telling others about their physical abuse. Physically-abused children aged more than 7 were found to present with a range of problem behaviours and fears. Child-abuse investigators often tolerated physical assaults on children, particularly by mothers. Moreover, child-abuse investigators did not routinely interview physically-abused children or treat the abuse as a criminal matter, especially if there were complicating family dynamics. 
 Sexually-abused children were usually victimised by unrelated, known males, less often by male relatives, and infrequently by strangers, fathers, or step-fathers. One-third of the sexual abusers were aged less than 17, and over 40% of the young offenders were aged less than 12. As with adult sexual offenders, the child and teenage sexual offenders were predominantly male. Child-abuse investigators usually did not refer the young sexual offenders to the authorities for follow-up. Risk factors for sexual abuse included being female and living with a single parent. Social workers often did not meet with sexually-abused children, but instead usually referred them for a forensic interview. Social workers may not have explored issues related to the sexually-abused children&#65533;s behaviour or their families in the manner that they did for the physically-abused children. 
 In both physical- and sexual-abuse cases, social workers were more likely to take action if children had made clear disclosures of abuse. However, despite disclosure being an important factor in decision-making, child-abuse investigators still did not meet with or interview every child, particularly preschool children and physically-abused children. The majority of factors that influenced child-abuse investigators&#65533; decisions to interview children were related to practice issues, in sexual-abuse cases, or tolerance of parental violence towards children, in physical-abuse cases. 
 Preschool children, whether physically- or sexually-abused, did not present differently from 5- or 6-year-olds in their behaviour or style of disclosure. However, compared to older children, child-abuse investigators were unlikely to interview preschoolers. 
 To conclude the thesis, I will highlight lessons to be learned from the present study and will make recommendations for child-abuse investigators, any professionals working with children and families, and the government of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abused children</field><field name="subject">child abuse</field><field name="subject">investigation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070430.162806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for the cultural landscape : from mountains to the sea : a Maori perspective</field><field name="creator">Sims, Miranda</field><field name="description">For Maori the cultural landscape is the foundation of traditional, historical and spiritual values and is fundamental to their cultural ideology. It is the relationship between people and the land that bestows Maori with a sense of cultural identity and belonging. At present the cultural landscape is under increasing pressure from inappropriate development, resulting not only in the destruction of the physical landscape but also defilement of associated intrinsic values.
	Planning for Maori cultural landscape values at the district level is challenging, with limited sucess in curbing landscape degradation under a dominant western planning regime. This study examines the planning process incorporating the cultural landscape values of Maori within the context of the Dunedin district. An overview of cultural landscape significance is provided. The study also assesses the current measures employed onto the landscape. The study also assesses the current measures employed for protecting the cultural landscape and offers recommendations for improving the integration of cultural landscape values into the planning process, both at a general level and with particular reference to three case studies of culturally significant landscapes in Dunedin.
	A combination of in-depth interviews with local Maori and Dunedin City Council planners, literature review, district plan content analysis and case studies established that current protection measures engaged by the Dunedin City Council are insufficient and lack the specificity required for adequate cultural landscape protection. A general lack of comprehension regarding cultural landscape meaning amongst planners was also found.
	It is recommended that cultural landscape planning extends beyond statutory requirements to adopt a collaborative approach, with Maori having a more significant role in the planning process. Three main recommendations for future management of the cultural landscape are provided: identification, co-management and public education. Together these recommendations promote a move towards a planning system with a greater bi-cultural focus. Improved protection provisions in planning will ensure the continuation and enhancement of the Maori cultural landscape into the future, as part of New Zealand&#65533;s heritage.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">landscape assessment</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.115102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The settlement of indigenous peoples claims to natural resources : the Sealords deal</field><field name="creator">Aitken, Kristin P</field><field name="description">The settlement of the claim to fisheries by Maori is a political milestone. The Sealords Deal (the Deal) as it is commonly known, is the first settlement in New Zealand which extinguishes Maori claims to a particular resource. It affects all iwi and proposes the development of a process for the allocation of benefits. As such it needs to be considered in terms of other post-colonial nations&#65533; experiences in the resolution of claims to natural resources.
	Canada, the United States and Australia provide examples of different attitudes and approaches to the resolution of claims to natural resources by their indigenous populations. A typical history of the resolution of claims to natural resources in post-colonial nations begins with initial European contact, followed by increased numbers of settlers which places pressure on governments and the judiciary to justify the acquisition and exploitation of land and other resources. This leaves the indigenous population landless and welfare dependent.
	This pattern is reflected in judicial decision-making. In New Zealand, the courts initially acknowledged that the rights of Maori to their lands and other resources, existed unless specifically taken away. When pressure for acquisition of land occurred the courts responded by holding that Maori rights to resources only existed if specifically granted by a court or the legislature. This reversed the original presumption of existence of a right unless taken away.
	It has only been recently that the New Zealand judiciary has reaccepted the common law doctrine of aboriginal title. This brings New Zealand more in line with Canada and the United States, but New Zealand still has some way to go in acknowledging the doctrine of fiduciary obligation of the Crown/government to Maori.
	It is also helpful to analyse the changes that have taken place in governments&#65533; policies that have enabled the creation of an enviroment in which such a settlement can take place. The Labour governments of 1984 and 1987 began a number of policy initiatives which created a socio-economic climate and responsive enviroment favourable to the settlement of such a claim.
	Changes are also occurring internationally. Indigenous people&#65533;s rights are coming to the fore with the proposed Universal Declaration on Indigenous Rights nearly in place.
	All this change at a national and international level has only been possible by post-colonial nations acknowledging their past in order to move to the future with confidence. The Sealords Deal is an example of an attempt by Maori and the New Zealand government to make this move forward.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">aborignial title</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">Native Americans</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.113012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary intake and incidence of dietary related health conditions in a sample of Dunedin Maori women</field><field name="creator">Barber, Glenda M</field><field name="description">Throughout the twentieth century, Maori life expectancy for both men and women has increased significantly. For most health conditions however, medical statistics show that the Maori mortality rate remains significantly higher than the rate for the NZ non-Maori population.
	The results of epidemiological studies show that some of these health conditions may be environmentally induced. There appears to be a high incidence of obesity in the Maori population which has been related to dietary intake, with an associated high incidence of diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. These conditions appear to be particularly prevalent among Maori women.
	It is thought that the Maori population are gentically susceptible to obesity; a trait which manifests itself when there is a plentiful food supply in the population.
	At present, there is very little information available about the dietary intake of the Maori population, or the effect of diet upon obesity and associated health disorders in this group.
	The aim of this survey was to obtain information about the dietary intake of a sample of Dunedin Maori women using the diet history method of assessment. Also to determine the incidence of obesity and other dietry related health conditions in this group.
	Chapter 2 reviews the change in food habits and health status of the Maori population over the last two centuries, as well as reviewing the different methods by which information for dietary surveys is obtained.
	After setting out the methods and findings of the survey, Chapter 5 discusses the results in light of information obtained from similar dietary studies of NZ women. The samples intake is compared to recommended nutrient allowances for NZ women and the incidence of dietary related health disorders is also discussed.
	Overall, Dunedin Maori women&#65533;s diet was not deficient in any of the recorded nutrients. Dunedin Maori women, in their middle years, exhibited substantially higher energy intakes than middle years non-Maori women in the 1977 National Dietary Survey. The level of Dunedin Maori women&#65533;s carbohydrate intake was the main contributing factor for this higher energy intake. Dunedin Maori women over 50 years of age exhibited substantially higher energy intakes than NZ women aged 50-54 years in the 1985 Timaru Health District Survey, with an overall higher consumption of carbohydrate, protein and fat. Over half of Dunedin Maori were classified as overweight or very overweight. Hypertension and diabetes were reported, and obesity was commonly found among women with these health conditions. Over half of Dunedin Maori women used cigarettes, the majority using between ten and thirty cigarettes per day.
	Dunedin Maori women are relatively isolated from the more densely populated areas of North Island Maori. As a result, the survey results cannot be interpreted as characteristic of NZ Maori women in general. The significance of these findings is rather the elucidation of a regional situation. Further studies of Maori women in both rural and urban areas of the North and South Island are necessary to determine if an overall pattern of high intake exists with a deleterious impact upon the health of Maori women.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">wahine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.114420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a deeper understanding of the polymorphic conversion of carbamazepine in aqueous suspension</field><field name="creator">Tian, Fang</field><field name="description">Polymorphism can influence every aspect of the properties of a solid including the shelf life, dissolution rate, solubility, formulation properties and processing properties of a solid drug. A deeper understanding of polymorphism and related solid state properties would ensure an improved quality of the materials used throughout drug preparation, dosage form formulation and clinical trials. Therefore, determination of the existence of polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs, characterization of different solid state forms and their respective properties, and controlling the existing form in the resulting formulation all form part of a rapidly growing field within pharmaceutical research and industry. 
 Carbamazepine (CBZ) was the model drug used in this study. FT-Raman spectroscopy was chosen as a main investigative technique in this study to evaluate its potential in monitoring (pseudo)polymorphic conversions in aqueous suspensions in the absence or presence of various pharmaceutical excipients. Partial least squares analysis (PLS) was used for quantitative analysis of the spectral data. 
 Earlier it has been found that CBZ converts rapidly to the dihydrate (DH) when exposed to humidity or water, and this has been reported to be the main reason for the sometimes observed greatly decreased bioavailability of marketed CBZ tablets. In this study, the conversion kinetics of CBZ (forms I, II and III) to DH in aqueous suspension were found to be first order kinetics with an unconverted portion (R&#65533; [greater than or equal to] 0.95), where the crystal morphology appeared to play a more important role in its conversion kinetics than the polymorphic form. The influence of pharmaceutical excipients on the conversion of CBZ in aqueous suspension was also explored. For excipients such as methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) which have both a low solubility parameter (&lt; 27.0 MPa[1/2]) and strong hydrogen bonding groups, complete inhibition of the conversion of CBZ was possible even at a very low concentration (0.1 % w/v). 
 Raman spectroscopy showed its high applicability in investigating CBZ conversion kinetics and screening of excipient effects in aqueous environment. It was demonstrated that Raman has a robust nature in quantitative analysis since problems such as different particle size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the two solid state forms of the drug seemed not to have significant influence on Raman scattering. 
 This study has also clarified the relative importance of many contributing factors (type of crystalline form (CBZ or DH), crystal morphology, surface area, and excipient interactions with drug particles) influencing the in vitro dissolution of CBZ. The solid state characterization approach taken in this study will provide a deeper insight into the dissolution performance of drugs and should thus lead to a better understanding of in vitro/in vivo behavior of drugs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbamazepine</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">suspensions</field><field name="subject">polymorphism</field><field name="subject">crystallography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070601.135438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"He kura Maori, he kura hahi, he kura katorika, he kura motuhake mo te iwi." Hato Paora College : a model of Maori Catholic education</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Nathan W</field><field name="description">Church initiated and operated Maori secondary boarding schools have existed in Aotearoa in various forms since the arrival of the missionaries in the early 19th century. Since their inception, they have contributed significantly to the development of Maori society, particularly in the production of dynamic Maori leaders who have had a compelling influence on their communities, wider Maori society and in some instances on the nation state. This thesis will examine the Society of Mary&#65533;s establishment of Hato Paora College, Feilding, as an example of a Maori Catholic secondary boarding school. 
 The first part contains four general chapters that provide relevant background information to the establishment of Hato Paora. The first identifies key aspects of a Maori Catholic world view and Maori Catholicism. Chapter two traces the arrival, and subsequent development, of the Catholic Church in New Zealand as a mission to Maori. The next chapter looks more specifically at the history of the Society of Mary in New Zealand and the development of the Diocese of Wellington, particularly their Maori missions, under their authority. Finally, Chapter four chronicles the situation of Maori within the New Zealand education system since its inception. 
 Part two of this thesis contains eight chapters that present a detailed case study of Hato Paora. The exploration of the type of educational environment provided by Hato Paora College begins in Chapter six with the examination of its foundation. Chapters seven and eight look at the philosophies and administration of each of the six rectors. The two succeeding chapters describe the defining characteristics of the school, its Maori character and its Catholic character. Chapter eleven evaluates how this school has influenced the boys who attended, using interviews with a representative sampling of old boys. Chapter twelve concerns the relationships that the College early established with the Maori communities that it belongs to. 
 In the final chapter, a model will be presented as a plan for the future of the school. This philosophical model attempts to provide a guide for Hato Paora, using Kaupapa Maori theory as the basic framework, while still retaining the ideals and philosophies of the College&#65533;s Marist founders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hato Paora College</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">Manawatu district</field><field name="subject">Catholic</field><field name="subject">high schools</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070921.134919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The doctrine of salvation in the first letter of Peter : a theological-critical study</field><field name="creator">Williams, Martin</field><field name="description">The importance and richness of 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriological language is generally acknowledged by commentators. However, apart from a few scattered and sporadic remarks in commentaries and in articles no full-scale study of 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriology has been carried out. This thesis seeks to fill that gap by conducting a detailed theological-critical study of the concept of salvation in the first letter of Peter. 
 Part one of this thesis outlines the presuppositions and approach to theological-critical exegesis taken here. Basic to a theological exegesis of Scripture, it will be noted, is the recognition of its dual authorship as a divine and human communicative action embodied in written discourse. This means that the interpreter must be oriented primarily toward the subject matter of the biblical text and be committed to discerning the meaning placed there by the divine and human authors. This is another way of saying that the theological interpreter must take seriously the literal sense of the text. To do this, I will suggest, involves three things (each of which will be discussed): (1) literal sense exegesis; (2) intercanonical conversation; (2) intercatholic conversation. 
 Part two contains a detailed theological-critical analysis of those passages in 1 Peter that treat the topic of salvation: 1:1-2; 2:4-10 (election); 1:18-21; 2:21-25; 3:18 (atonement); 1:3, 23-25 (regeneration); 1:3-12; 3:18-4:6 (eschatological salvation). We will see that 1 Peter&#65533;s soteriological outlook exhibits a salvation-historical framework which locates the initiative for salvation in God&#65533;s eternal, sovereign and gracious electing purpose (1:1-2; 2:4-19), decisively inaugurated in the death (1:10-12, 18-21; 2:21-25; 3:18) and subsequent resurrection, ascension, exaltation and vindication of Christ (1:3, 11, 21; 2:4d, 7d; 3:18e, 19, 21d-22; 4:13; 5:1, 4, 10), existentially realized through the proclamation of the message of salvation (1:12, 23) and the experience of the new birth (1:3, 23), and finally consummated at the return of Christ when suffering and death will give way to life, victory and vindication (1:3-12; 3:18-4:6). Peter&#65533;s unique presentation of the believers&#65533; eschatological salvation in terms of future victory and vindication is designed to engender hope amongst a small minority of believers facing the onslaught of a hostile world against their faith. 
 In part three I seek to bring the results of my exegesis into dialogue with a variety of theological traditions (e.g., Reformed, Neo-orthodox, Lutheran, Arminian, Pelagian, Wesleyan) in order to allow 1 Peter to make its own distinctive contribution to the ongoing discussion (both between the traditions and between the bible and theology) but also to allow that dialogue to shape and sharpen our own understanding of salvation in 1 Peter. Because of the confines of space the discussion here is limited to the doctrines of election, atonement and regeneration. While at a conceptual level this thesis is an investigation of the concepts and presentation of salvation in the first letter of Peter, at a methodological level it further seeks to overcome the present and unfortunate segregation of biblical studies and theological studies and hopes further to open up the way for a more fruitful dialogue between the two.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">Biblical</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">salvation</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">doctrines</field><field name="subject">Peter</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071120.160505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr Edward Shortland and the politics of ethnography</field><field name="creator">Lousberg, Marjan</field><field name="description">In 1840 Captain William Hobson established the colony of New Zealand under an umbrella of humanitarianism and with an agenda for the protection of Maori rights. This thesis examines this project through the work of Dr Edward Shortland (1812-1893). Although Shortland&#65533;s reports and publications have been frequently cited, there has been no detailed historical analysis of his work. 
 Shortland arrived in New Zealand in 1841 as the private secretary of Governor Hobson. In 1842 he was appointed Protector of Aborigines for the Eastern Districts. One of his tasks was to study Maori language and customs in order to mediate between Maori and government. He was one of the earliest European experts on Maori traditions, customary practices, religious attitudes and relationships with land. After his return to England in 1846, he lobbied the British government on behalf of Maori and published two books on New Zealand, in which he addressed prospective colonists and disputed some of the propaganda of colonising companies. Shortland came back to New Zealand in the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s, during which periods he worked as Civil Commissioner in the Hauraki area, as Native Secretary, and as adviser to the government on Native affairs. 
 Shortland was part of a network of concerned Christian humanitarians who were intent on bringing government and law and order to New Zealand in a manner that facilitated peaceful European settlement, without serious injury to the Maori population. Humanitarians were not opposed to colonisation or settlement and in this respect may be seen as part of the imperial enterprise. In the framework of political and philosophical thought in the nineteenth century, humanitarians expected no more than to mitigate the effects of colonisation. This study explores these issues in the context of Shortland&#65533;s interaction with and ethnography about Maori over a period of forty years. 
 I begin by placing the concept of aboriginal protection in context. The core of this thesis is an examination of Shortland&#65533;s work as Protector of Aborigines. He had three tasks: to mediate in disputes between Europeans and Maori; to accustom Maori to English law; and to protect Maori land rights against claims from settlers. The first of these tasks proved the most straightforward. Shortland&#65533;s attempts to fulfil the second task highlighted the complex relationship between religion and law and the role of Christianity. The land question proved the most complicated, as a result of the tension between government attempts to protect Maori land rights, the pressure from settlers for land, and European lack of understanding of Maori customs. Maori desire to sell land to attract settlers further complicated relationships. Shortland&#65533;s contribution to our understanding of these issues and of Maori traditions of land tenure is considerable. While the course of colonisation may have been inevitable, I suggest that Shortland and likeminded contemporaries laid the foundation for later recognition of Maori rights, as exemplified today by the work of the Waitangi Tribunal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Edward Shortland</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">ethnologists</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">people</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071204.160209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The early life of James Hector, 1834 to 1865 : the first Otago Provincial Geologist</field><field name="creator">Hocken, A. G</field><field name="description">The geologist James Hector (1834-1907) was, by any measure, the most important and influential scientist in nineteenth century New Zealand. In the mid 1860s, he became the first Director of the New Zealand Geological Survey and the Colonial Museum. Thereafter he ran the Colonial Laboratory, set up the Meteorological Service and the Wellington Botanical Gardens and was responsible for the establishment of the New Zealand Institute, acting as its manager and editor of its Transactions and Proceedings for more than 30 years. This work explores the formative years of his career from his early years in Scotland, his experiences with the Palliser Expedition in Canada, and pivotally, his first four years in New Zealand as the first Otago Provincial Geologist. 
 By the time of James Hector&#65533;s entry as a medical student to Edinburgh University in 1852, he had already developed a strong interest in natural history, particularly geology. Although he graduated M.D. from Edinburgh in 1856, that course of study served only as a means of access to the natural sciences. Hector&#65533;s interest and training in geology developed at an opportune time, when there was increasing demand for geologists to explore the expanding industrial British Empire for coal and other mineral raw materials. 
 Hector&#65533;s reputation in geology in Edinburgh brought him to the attention of that most influential British geologist, Sir Roderick Murchison, whose recommendation led to his appointment to the British North American Expedition of 1857 (the Palliser Expedition). Hector was acknowledged, on several counts, as a major contributor to the success of the expedition. When the Otago Provincial Government in New Zealand requested advice on the appointment of a geologist for the province, Murchison predictably proposed Hector. 
 Having reviewed and assessed his work in North America, this thesis deals with the arrival of Hector as Otago Provincial Geologist in Dunedin during the prosperity of the gold rush of the early 1860s. For the first nine months he explored the central and eastern areas of the Province (Chapter 2) and the following year led the exploration of the West Coast, where there was potential for coal, gold and timber-and reputedly copper-and the prospect of providing a commercial route to Melbourne. The two month long expedition up the Matukituki Valley preceded the exploration by ship of the West Coast of the South Island as far north as Martins Bay. The latter became a major triumph on the strength of the contemporary perception of a route between Queenstown and Martins Bay potentially opening up a direct contact between Dunedin and Melbourne. 
 From mid-1864, Hector&#65533;s life was governed by the organisation of the International Exhibition, which opened in Dunedin in January 1865. In that context, he travelled to seek support and participation from the other provinces of New Zealand, a political and administrative commission which he combined with geological exploration. 
 After the closure of the successful Exhibition in May 1865 and subsequent to the conclusion of his appointment on 1st April 1865, Hector left Otago in August to take up the newly created post of Director of the New Zealand Geological Survey in Wellington. The parting was not administratively smooth and relations between Hector and the Otago Provincial Government were strained by the lack of a final, definitive, report on the Geology of Otago. An overview of Hector&#65533;s geology, specifically his interest in coal and gold, and the evolution of his views on the vexed question of the role of glaciers as geomorphologic agents is provided. 
 James Hector was a man of versatile ability and strong leadership. His scientific skills as a field geologist and the administrative abilities, developed during his explorations in British North America and southern New Zealand, led ultimately to his long and successful career as New Zealand&#65533;s chief scientist at a formative time in its history.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sir James Hector (1834-1907)</field><field name="subject">geologists</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">biography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080227.144316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of film in destination decision-making</field><field name="creator">Croy, William Glen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to create a method and measure the influence of fictional film media in potential tourists&#65533; destination decision-making, using a quasi-experimental method. Film tourism researchers have implied that film plays a direct role in generating tourism. In this research, however, it is proposed that film plays an indirect role through the construction of meaning of place, and therefore destination awareness, availability and evaluation. 
 A two-part multiphase quasi-experimental method was created and implemented to identify change in a destination&#65533;s image due to watching a film. Part One. was qualitative in nature and implemented to discover destination image attributes (evaluative components and decision-making factors) used in destination selection (survey n=202, in-depth interviews n=10). Part One concluded with the compilation of a list of relevant, clear and efficient attributes for Part Two. The list maintained sufficient diversity to define destination image, and was composed of 21 decision-making factors and 40 evaluative components. Part Two then measured the destination&#65533;s image, and change in that image due to watching a feature film (pre and post survey n=67). Change in this quasi-experimental method was assessed by the importance of the attributes being measured, the influence of the film on these attributes and most importantly the combined effect of the film on these attributes. 
 The Vertical Ray of the Sun, a film set in Vietnam, was used to apply and test this innovative quasi-experimental method. The application assessed not only the effect of the film on Vietnam&#65533;s image, but also the applicability of the method. The film positively influenced the respondents&#65533; image of Vietnam. The film had a measured effect on more than half of the attributes. That noted, the actual number of attributes affected to the marked level were 17 out of 61 for the difference in means and only 11 for the eta&#65533; value. Consequently, whilst the film positively affected the image of Vietnam, most of the attributes still needed significant change to modify tourism demand. 
 The thesis importantly contributed to the study of destination image methodologically by asserting the need to assess the importance, influence and effect. This new method can and should be implemented to assess and monitor the effects of many events. This research also contributed by introducing a quasi-experimental cumulative importance-influence measure of effect. The contribution was highlighted in that those attributes with a large influence did not always have a large effect on the destination&#65533;s image. Neither performance by itself, nor importance by itself, can be used as a final effect measure. 
 Finally, this research supports other film-induced tourism studies: film does influence destination image. As presented in more recent studies film-tourism is more likely to be an incidental experience than a reason to visit a place. These more recent studies too may underplay the role of film by focusing on film as an attraction or activity, rather than its role in the actual decision to visit. This research has contributed to film tourism research by highlighting that film can still play a role in the decision-making process, even though it may not be an attraction or a desired experience in itself.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.155622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of key species and functional guilds in facilitating fluxes of organic matter across habitat boundaries in Fiordland</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">The secondary productivity of communities is inherently influenced by the availability and quality of food resources. Movement of organic matter (OM) across landscapes can connect adjacent systems by providing subsidies of carbon and nutrients, implying that alterations of environments from their natural state may affect the productivity of neighboring food webs. The intact terrestrial and marine environments of Fiordland provide a setting to study linkages between the land and the sea. The first general objective of this study was to determine if large but nutritionally poor (nitrogen-poor, carbon-rich) inputs of forest litter support marine secondary production, and to identify pathways for incorporation of this material into upper trophic levels. Pools of marine and terrestrial OM had distinct values of [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N, [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C and [delta]&#65533;&#8308;S, providing high power to estimate the relative use of these sources by the food webs of the fjord-head deltas. Deposit feeding invertebrates (e.g. Echinocardium cordatum, Pectinaria australis) directly assimilated plant detritus. Heterotrophic bacteria on the surface of the sediment assimilated forest litter and provided a potential food source for invertebrates. Chemoautotrophic bacteria fix CO&#8322; that originates from decomposing forest litter, thus providing an indirect pathway for incorporation of forest litter into the food webs. In the deep basins the strength of the flux of uptake by chemoautotrophic bacteria through the benthic food web into the upper trophic levels was demonstrated by hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) obtaining 38-51% of their nutrition from these bacteria. 
 The ability of a community to utilize discrete sources of OM relies on the presence of specific functional feeding guilds. Marine algae provide a highly nutritive (nitrogen-rich) food source for the fjord communities and fluxes of algae into food webs are facilitated by grazing invertebrates and filter feeders. The second general objective of this study was to determine how the effective loss of filter feeders from inner Doubtful Sound would alter the flux of marine-derived OM to the food webs of the delta communities. The low salinity environment imposed by the hydroelectric power station in Doubtful Sound caused a large reduction in the abundance of the infaunal bivalves Austrovenus stutchburyi and Paphies australis from delta habitats. Clams could tolerate periods of freshwater exposure of [less than or equal to]20 days duration, but the constant freshwater conditions in Doubtful Sound decreased survivorship. In 2004/05 the biomass of these species in inner Doubtful Sound (7.28 tonnes) was 29 times smaller than in Bradshaw Sound (214.12 tonnes). The associated loss of biodeposits (~91 tonnes(DW) yr&#8315;&#65533; in Bradshaw Sound vs. 1 tonne(DW) yr&#8315;&#65533; in inner Doubtful Sound) may have also altered the flux of nutritive OM to the infaunal community. The river delta communities in inner Doubtful Sound appear to have a higher reliance on forest litter than those in Bradshaw Sound, which is apparent as low values of [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N and [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C for estuarine fish (Notolabrus celidotus, Hemerocoetes monopterygius), which act as integrators of the benthic community. 
 This study demonstrates important linkages between terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems and highlights the role of functional diversity in facilitating fluxes of organic material through food webs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">ecosystems</field><field name="subject">biotic communities</field><field name="subject">species diversity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080505.131451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Canterbury Society of Arts 1880-1996 : conformity and dissension revisited</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Warren</field><field name="description">Established in 1880 the Canterbury Society of Arts (CSA) dominated the arts in Canterbury for nearly a century and was the most significant art society in New Zealand. This thesis examines the CSA&#65533;s history from 1880 to its change in trading name to the Centre of Contemporary Art (COCA) in 1996 when the Society sought to redefine its role. Chapter One considers its origins, comprising a discussion of the period from 1850 to 1880 in which it was founded as part of an educational complex that reflected Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#65533;s ideal for the systematic settlement of Canterbury. A discussion of the Society&#65533;s permanent collection from 1881 to 1932 in the following chapter draws attention to how the CSA was guided by its founding ambitions to promote the development of New Zealand art and accompanying responsibilities for art education. Chapter Three considers the premises and art galleries utilised by the Society from 1881 to 1932, revealing that its objectives to advance the arts remained visionary and often demanding. In Chapter Four the period between the Depression and the end of the Second World War is examined and economic and aesthetic challenges, evident in the Society&#65533;s limited capacity to purchase works for its collection, alongside the emergence of new art organisations such as the Group are discussed. This is followed by a consideration of the post-war period from the perspective of the CSA&#65533;s remarkable secretary from 1943 to 1959, William Sykes Baverstock. His response to an emerging modern movement provides a context to examine significant changes in the arts which initially posed a challenge to the CSA. Consideration of the 1960s to mid-1970s in Chapter Six reveals the vital role played by the CSA in supporting the development of contemporary New Zealand art and includes discussion of significant events and exhibitions such as the Hay&#65533;s Art Prize and the expansion of the Society&#65533;s programme to include international shows and solo exhibitions of contemporary sculpture, craft, design, and painting. It argues that these activities represented the CSA&#65533;s most ambitious and successful period in its history, symbolised by its new modernist-styled gallery which opened at 66 Gloucester Street in 1968. An examination of the late 1970s to mid-1980s in Chapter Seven demonstrates that the CSA continued to maintain its influence as a centre for contemporary arts practice. However, the demands of a greater arts professionalism championed by the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council and accompanied by a growth in dealer galleries, meant that the CSA also became subjected to criticism and this despite its continuing capacity to expose large audiences to new and challenging arts practices. The close and long-standing relationship between the CSA and the Canterbury College School of Art is considered in Chapter Eight and the way in which this contributed to the Society&#65533;s cultural supremacy is acknowledged. The deaccession of 42 important historical works from the CSA&#65533;s permanent collection in 1995 discussed in Chapter Nine reveals the extent to which its stature had substantially changed by the 1990s. Its essentially nineteenth-century infrastructure was ultimately inappropriate for addressing new levels of arts professionalism. Chapter Ten concludes that the CSA was a visionary, and sometimes radical, arts organisation that deserves to be more carefully and generously considered. Indeed, its long history reveals a vital arts and educational institution that has made an essential but hitherto hugely underrated contribution to New Zealand&#65533;s cultural development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canterbury Society of Arts</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">societies</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090226.135746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of photoinhibition in the obligate shade plant ginseng</field><field name="creator">Woods, Matthew Alan</field><field name="description">Obligate shade plants possess adaptations that enable them to photosynthesise in the low light environment of the forest floor. Adaptations that facilitate light scavenging may compromise capacity for high rates of photosynthesis. This study compares the responses of obligate shade and facultative shade plant species upon exposure to elevated light. The obligate shade plants were two commercially grown medicinal herb species of ginseng, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer and Panax quinquefolius L.; and goldenseal - Hydrastis canadensis L. Comparison was made to Arabidopsis thaliana and Pisum sativum L. as facultative shade species. Panax ginseng (Korean ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng) are obligate shade plants found in broadleaf forests of Eastern Asia and North America, respectively. Studies on these plants have shown optimal growth at light intensities between 200-300 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533;. s&#8315;&#65533;, or 10-15% of full sunlight, and at intensities greater than 500 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533;. s&#8315;&#65533; characteristic photoinbibitory symptoms develop. An atypical response to methyl viologen in photosynthetic electron transport assays was observed in ginseng in both isolated thylakoid membranes and whole leaves. No correlation was found between detectable superoxide dismutase activity and altered methyl viologen reactions. In a mutagenesis study using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a unique amino acid residue in the terminal electron acceptor PsaC, found only in ginseng, was changed and found to have no effect on methyl viologen reactions. Electron transfer to methyl viologen was examined in both isolated thylakoid membranes and whole leaves using chlorophyll a fluorescence and the apparent ability for methyl viologen to act as an electron acceptor was observed to differ between ginseng species. Obligate shade species were observed to possess alternate pools of photosystem II centres that potentially provide a mechanism to maximise photosynthetic gain under low light and during short periods of increased illumination. In experiments designed to identify physiological processes that contribute to increased susceptibility to photoinhibition in obligate shade plants, responses were observed and characterised following a moderate increase in illumination (140 to 400 [mu]mol photons. m&#8315;&#65533; . s&#8315;&#65533;) using chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curve analysis. The obligate shade species exhibited varied responses to elevated light and showed increased susceptibility, to photoinhibition. Photoprotective non-photochemical dissipative capacity was quantified and found to be comparable between all species studied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ginseng</field><field name="subject">araliaceae</field><field name="subject">photoinhibition</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090417.121807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional morphology of the human thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles</field><field name="creator">Cornwall, Jonathan Edgar</field><field name="description">The thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles are vital in normal function and are implicated in the pathogenesis of different forms of spinal pathology and pain. They are the target for specific forms of clinical intervention such as exercise regimens and the release of &#65533;trigger points&#65533;, and are often analysed through imaging studies and electromyographic recordings. 
 Despite the importance of these muscles, there is a paucity of knowledge in regard to aspects of their functional morphology. The aim of this thesis was to examine the thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles between the mid-thoracic spine and sacrum, examining their gross morphology, fibre arrangement, fibre types, and an animal model in order to provide a better understanding of their functional morphology. 
 The gross morphology of these muscles was studied by micro-dissection of cadaveric material. Their form was found to differ from that published in either text book or peer reviewed articles, clearly indicating the existence of a &#65533;semispinalis&#65533; muscle in the lumbar spine. In addition, the arrangement of these muscles was found to be homologous between the thoracic and lumbar regions, which is contrary to published descriptions. 
 Arrangement of the muscle fibres was examined by identifying motor endplates with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry in all muscles throughout the area of interest. Only one endplate per fibre was observed, and no in-series fibres were found. All muscles showed a complex multipinnate form with large areas of muscle tendon intruding into each muscle. 
 Fibre type proportions in each muscle were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results indicate the percentage of total muscle area occupied by type I fibres decreased the more caudad the vertebral level of origin, for all muscles. There were significant differences in the area percentage of type I fibres between many different vertebral levels. These differences were mostly found between the most cranial and most caudal levels examined. The percentage of type I fibres recorded suggest all muscles are likely postural in function, and the gradual decrease in type I fibres and the lack of a distinct thoracic / lumbar boundary in the data suggests the thoracic and lumbar transversospinal muscles are homologous. 
 The thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles of the MLC3F nlacZ transgenic mouse were micro-dissected to determine their morphology, and their fibre arrangement subsequently determined using acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. These muscles showed a homogeneous form throughout the thoracolumbar spine, and no in-series muscle fibres were observed with all muscles having one motor endplate per fibre. Results indicated similarities between the morphology of mouse and human transversospinal muscles, perhaps indicative of an adaptation to an upright posture. 
 This thesis provides information that facilitates a more complete understanding of the morphology and function of the thoracolumbar transversospinal muscles. In addition, results indicate that these muscles are homologous through the thoracic and lumbar spine, and therefore the classification and nomenclature used to describe these muscles should be re-examined. Furthermore, the morphological evidence, combined with recent embryological studies, supports the use of the term &#65533;spinotransverse&#65533; to more accurately describe this muscle group.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spine</field><field name="subject">muscles</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">diseases</field><field name="subject">etiology</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090615.144650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The many derelicts of the War? Great War veterans and repatriation in Dunedin and Ashburton, 1918 to 1928</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Gwen A</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Government&#65533;s repatriation measures to assist Great War veterans have largely been considered a failure. This thesis examines repatriation through the experiences of Dunedin and Ashburton veterans, demonstrating that within the context of the 1920s pre-welfare state these provisions proved to be both generous and far more successful than is often suggested. The Government&#65533;s repatriation response to returning veterans reflected contemporary attitudes towards dependency and need. Belief in self-reliance underpinned repatriation policy, with a stated aim of restoring veterans to the civil position they held prior to enlistment rather than providing assistance to move up the occupational ladder. Fear of the morally corrosive effect of dependency, as well as economic concerns, meant the repatriation provisions were principally concerned with ensuring veterans regained financial independence through employment. To that end war pensions compensated for lost earning power, rather than providing a full living income, and repatriation provisions largely consisted of assistance in finding jobs or obtaining farms and businesses. The Government&#65533;s repatriation provisions also reflected contemporary medical knowledge. The repatriation legislation restricted war pensions and free medical care to veterans with disabilities directly attributable to military service. However the link between military service and disability remained unclear in many cases. Slightly more than half of those discharged unfit suffered from sickness rather than wounds, many from conditions common among the civilian population. Contemporary aetiological knowledge often did not support the war pension applications lodged by returned soldiers disabled as a result of non-contagious disease, and an absence of clinical evidence undermined claims of latent illness. In addition the medical profession&#65533;s failure to adopt psychological theory and practice meant that by the early 1920s shell shock sufferers were treated according to psychiatric medicine&#65533;s understanding of mental illness. 
 Within the context of 1920s New Zealand the repatriation provisions were generous: the Repatriation Department&#65533;s work had no precedent; the war disabled were one of the few groups to receive state pensions and received more than other state pensioners; and the provisions of the soldier settlement scheme were available to all veterans, regardless of health, capital or farming experience. Despite the limited aims of the Government&#65533;s repatriation provisions many veterans did successfully re-establish themselves in civilian society. By the 1930s Ashburton soldier settlements had proved more successful than others in Canterbury, and compared well with other crown settlements in Ashburton County. More generally war service produced no dramatic change in the occupational structure of veterans: veterans generally retained their occupational status during the post-war decade, volunteers faring slightly better than conscripts but neither as well as their civilian counterparts. Although some veterans certainly did experience need and indigence after the war the majority of urban and rural men in the sample groups were financially stable, particularly after the boom and bust of the immediate post-war years. The men in the Dunedin and Ashburton sample groups represent the most successful of the returned soldier population nevertheless they show that a significant proportion of Great War veterans were successfully repatriated by the end of the post-war decade.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War (1914-1918)</field><field name="subject">repatriations</field><field name="subject">veterans</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="subject">services for veterans</field><field name="subject">Dunedin</field><field name="subject">Ashburton</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090708.092730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mt. Morning, Antarctica : geochemistry, geochronology, petrology, volcanology, and oxygen fugacity of the rifted Antarctic lithosphere</field><field name="creator">Martin, Adam Paul</field><field name="description">Mt. Morning is a 2,732 m high, Cenozoic, alkaline eruptive centre situated in the south-west corner of McMurdo Sound in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Mt. Morning is approximately 100 km south-west of Mt. Erebus, the world's southernmost active volcano. Several Cenozoic, alkali eruptive centres in this region make up the Erebus Volcanic Province. The region is currently undergoing continental extension. Regional-scale, north-striking faulting on the northern flank of Mt. Morning has offset vertical dykes, as young as 3.9 Ma, by up to 6 m dextrally. This is consistent with the trans-extensional regime in the region. The faults also have a dip-slip component, downthrown to the east. These faults define part of the western boundary of the West Antarctic Rift System. Mt. Morning straddles the boundary between the continental rift shoulder of the Transantarctic Mountains in Southern Victoria Land, and the perceived oceanic crust of the Ross Sea. Age determination of the youngest offset dyke constrains movement in the last 3.88 &#65533; 0.05 m.y., to an average rate of 0.0015 mm per year.
Volcanism on Mt. Morning is divided into two phases. Phase I was erupted between 18.7 &#65533; 0.3 and 114 &#65533; 0.2 Ma and Phase II between 6.13 &#65533; 0.20 and 0.15 &#65533; 0.01 Ma. The two phases are separated by a 5.3 m.y. period of quiescence. The geochemistry of Phase I is mildly alkaline; it is composed of volcaniclastic deposits, dykes, sills, and volcanic plugs of nepheline-basanite, nepheline-trachyte, quartz-mugearite, quartz-trachyte, and rhyolite. Phase I rocks evolved along at least two trends: a quartz normative trend, and a nepheline normative trend. Chemical variation in Phase I can be explained in part by crystal fractionation, which has been modelled using major element multiple linear regression. Phase I quartz-mugearite can fractionate to quartz-trachyte after 44% crystallisation. Quartz-trachyte can fractionate to rhyolite after a further 6% erystallisation. The models indicate that clinopyroxene + plagioclase + opaque oxides &#65533; alkali feldspar &#65533; apatite are the dominant fractionated phases. Many of the Phase I quartz normative volcanic rocks have relatively high &#8312;&#8311;Sr/&#8312;&#8310;Sr ratios (0.70501), suggesting that assimilation, most likely of crustal material, has modified them. Phase I nepheline-basanite can fractionate to nepheline-trachyte after 68% crystallisation. Modelling indicates clinopyroxene + nepheline + olivine + opaque oxides are the dominant fractionated phases.
Phase II volcanic rocks are strongly alkaline and are mapped as flows, volcaniclastic deposits, dykes, and sills. They have been erupted mainly from parasitic scoria vents and rarely from fissure vents. Rock types include picrobasalt, basalt, basanite, tephrite, hawaiite, mugearite, phonotephrite, tephriphonolite, benmoreite, and phonolite. Chemical variations in the Phase II volcanic rocks can be explained by simple fractionation. Phase II picrobasalt can fractionate to phonotephrite after 78% crystallisation. Phonotephrite can fractionate to phonolite after at least 35% crystallisation, depending on which of several multiple linear regression models are selected. Fractionation is dominated by the removal of clinopyroxene + plagioclase + nepheline + olivine + opaque oxides &#65533; apatite &#65533; kaersutite. Volcanic rocks in the Erebus Volcanic Province are strongly alkaline on a silica versus total alkalis plot, similar to the Phase II volcanic rocks from Mt. Morning. Mildly alkaline rocks of Phase I are, to date, unique within the Erebus Volcanic Province.
Bulk rock isotope ratios of &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr (0.70307 - 0.70371 and 0.70498 - 0.70501), &#65533;&#8308;&#65533;Nd/&#65533;&#8308;&#8308;Nd (0.512650 - 0.512902), and &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&#65533;&#8304;&#8308;Pb (18.593 -20.039) show that the majority of Mt. Morning volcanic rocks lie on a mixing line between HIMU (high-[mu]; enriched in &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb and &#65533;&#8304;&#8312;Pb and relatively depleted in &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr values) and DM (depleted mantle; high &#65533;&#8308;&#65533;Nd/&#65533;&#8308;&#8308;Nd, low &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr, and low &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&#65533;&#8304;&#8308;Pb). This is similar to the majority of volcanic rocks from the SW Pacific, including Antarctica and New Zealand. Mt. Morning volcanic rocks have tapped this broadly common mantle reservoir.
There are variations in radiogenic isotope ratios between Mt. Morning and Mt. Erebus. There are also differences between the incompatible element ratios in volcanic rocks from Mt. Morning, Mt. Erebus, and White Island (a third eruptive centre in the Erebus Volcanic Province), suggesting heterogeneity in the mantle beneath the Erebus Volcanic Province. Significant chemical differences are also noted between ultramafic xenoliths collected from Mt. Morning and from Foster Crater only 15 km away. This suggests a deca-kilometre, possibly even kilometre-scale, heterogeneity in the mantle. Such small-scale chemical differences appear difficult to reconcile with large-scale plume hypotheses for the initiation of volcanism in the Erebus Volcanic Province. Instead, volcanism is much more likely to be related to numerous small plumes, or the preferred hypothesis, metasomatism and amagmatic rifting, followed by decompression melting of upwelling mantle and volcanism during transtensional lithospheric rifting. This latter model is supported by a lack of regional updoming expected with a plume(s), and fits models of localised extension proposed in this thesis.
Calc-alkaline and alkaline igneous xenoliths, of felsic to mafic crustal material, have been collected from Mt. Morning. U-Pb geochronology (545.4 &#65533; 3.7 Ma and 518.6 &#65533; 4.4 Ma) on crustal xenoliths from Mt. Morning illustrate that the basement is Cambrian. Bulk rock chemistry of crustal xenoliths has similarities to compositions reported for Ross Orogen rocks, suggesting the Mt. Morning volcanic edifice is built on a basement that is composed of Cambrian Ross Orogen rock types. Quartz-bearing felsic granulite xenoliths with greater than 70 weight percent silica, collected from Mt. Morning, suggest that part of the basement is felsic. This is the only occurrence of felsic xenoliths reported to date east of the present day coastline of Victoria Land. Mt. Morning crops out less than 25 km from the known northern end of the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Transantarctic Mountains. The partially alkaline basement beneath Mt. Morning suggests the province may continue beneath part of Mt. Morning.
The mantle beneath Mt. Morning can be characterised as anhydrous and otherwise largely unmetasomatised, which is atypical of xenoliths collected from the western Ross Sea. Only a handful of Mt. Morning xenoliths show petrographic evidence of metasomatism, these include modal phlogopite, apatite, Fe-Ni sulphide, and plagioclase (in pyroxenite xenoliths), suggesting metasomatising fluids occur discretely in this region. Where present, the metasomatic fluid(s) beneath Mt. Morning are enriched in Ba, LREEs, Th, U, P, Fe, Ni, S, and K, and depleted in Ti relative to the metasomatic fluid composition described at nearby Foster Crater.
Oxygen fugacity (fO&#8322;) of the Antarctic shallow mantle has been measured from xenoliths collected from Mt. Morning, where fO&#8322; was demonstrated to be strongly dependant upon spinel Fe&#65533;&#8314; content that was measured using Mo&#776;ssbauer spectroscopy, and calculated from the olivine-orthopyroxene-spinel oxybarometer. fO&#8322; in the rifted Antarctic mantle varies between 0.1 and -1 log units relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer and is coupled to melt depletion, with increasing degrees of melt extraction resulting in a more oxidised mantle. This range of upper mantle fO&#8322; is commonly observed in continental rift settings worldwide.
The mantle beneath Mt. Morning is composed of, in increasing degree of fertility, dunite, harzburgite, and lherzolite. Xenoliths representing discrete samples of this mantle have mostly crystallised in the spinel stability field of the mantle at pressures of approximately 15 kb and temperatures between 950 - 970 &#65533;C. Symplectites of spinel and pyroxene have been interpreted as petrographic evidence that some of the spinel peridotite originated in the garnet stability field of the mantle. Rare plagioclase-bearing spinel lherzolite (plagioclase lherzolite) is also present in the mantle beneath Mt. Morning, which crystallised at temperatures of between 885 and 935 &#65533;C at 5 kb. The Mt. Morning peridotite xenoliths plot along the pre-defined geotherm for the Erebus Volcanic Province, strongly supporting it as the appropriate choice of geothermal gradient for south-west McMurdo Sound.
Mineral and bulk rock compositions are nearly identical between the plagioclase lherzolite xenoliths and spinel lherzolite xenoliths. Mineral and bulk rock chemistry suggest it is unlikely that the plagioclase is due to metasomatism. Petrographic evidence and mass balance calculations suggest that the plagioclase lherzolite has crystallised via a sub-solidus (metamorphic) transition from spinel lherzolite upon decompression and upwelling of the mantle. The occurrence of plagioclase lherzolite beneath Mt. Morning could be explained by lithospheric scale uplift along faults that define the western margin of the West Antarctic Rift System. Plagioclase lherzolite has also been collected and described from White Island. White Island is also interpreted to straddle lithospheric scale faults. Rifting and buoyant uplift is sufficient to explain the presence of plagioclase lherzolite in the Erebus Volcanic Province. Plagioclase lherzolite has also been described from Mt Melbourne, an eruptive centre in Northern Victoria Land. Known occurrences of plagioclase lherzolite from the western shoulder of the Ross Sea now cover an area 430 km long and 80 km wide. This is one of the largest provinces of plagioclase peridotite worldwide so far reported.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">volcanism</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">petrology</field><field name="subject">rifts (geology)</field><field name="subject">geological time</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Mount Morning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090812.090902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where are the boundaries in supporting people with disabilities?</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Helen</field><field name="description">In home support is now being provided to not only people with disabilities but also to those who are ageing or have a psychological impairment.  It is preferred by both government and support recipients as a viable alternative to the more costly and disruptive institutional support.  This study looks at the various parties that are involved in managing the boundaries when providing support in unconventional workplaces; workplaces that are also homes; homes that are controlled and managed by the person receiving the support, not the person supervising the worker.      The distance the home is from the organisation, the place from which the employee is supervised becomes a physical boundary.  Boundaries are also psychological; a home is a space that forms a safe refuge from the world, a home is comforting and secure; a space that contains precious possessions.  The workers are working within someone's intimate space.  This creates difficulties for both the workers and their supervisors.     The study takes a psychodynamic approach.  What is happening at an unconscious level influences the behaviour of the various parties and can change and distort the desired outcomes for the client.  The material for the study was gathered from interviews, Murray's Thematic Apperception Techniques (TAT) (Teglasi 2001) style exercises and drawings from eight clients, five coordinators and five support workers.  Two workplaces were observed and seven case studies collected.  A survey of 389 support workers was conducted and analysed.        The results highlight the preoccupation of organisations and through them service coordinators, with controlling risk in the workplace.  This puts them at odds with clients who feel they have control over their own homes.  Both clients and coordinators vigorously defend what they see as their territory.  The coordinators are left feeling envious of the support workers who have a close relationship with their clients, a relationship about which, they as former support workers have personal knowledge.        The support worker's role is to support.  They are only able to do this by defending and smothering their own emotional responses through a veil of niceness.  They are unable to express many of their own feelings, which might not only be regarded as shameful but also condemned by their employer.  Most staff, both support workers and coordinators lack the skills to manage and understand their own emotional responses.       Although there is no easy answer to the dilemma raised within this context.  I hope by identifying what is happening organisations might be able to at least understand the origins of individual carers', clients' and coordinators' behaviours and take steps to provide a safe container in which these feelings can be explored and discussed.     The in-home care industry has difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.  Organisations therefore need to invest in supporting staff who work in these situations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with a Disability</field><field name="subject">Psychodynamic</field><field name="subject">In-Home Care</field><field name="subject">Support Worker</field><field name="subject">Not-for-profit Organisation.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100218.095201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The preparation and characterization of polypropylene-compatibilizer-filler composites</field><field name="creator">Huang, Huan Yao</field><field name="description">Polypropylene (PP) composites includ a mineral filler, though they can be enhanced by blending with an elastomer. Blending rigid fillers with PP increased strength while decreasing toughness. Blending soft elastomers with PP decreased strength while increasing toughness. PP-elastomer-filler ternary composites offer synergism because the increase of strength due to filler may compensate the loss of strength due to the elastomer. Two morphologies were identified, separated elastomer and filler particles in PP, and filler particles encapsulated by elastomer in PP. Interaction between filler and PP matrix are proposed to increase with the addition of polar elastomers when encapsulated morphology is formed, leading to enhanced mechanical properties. PP-elastomer-filler blended tapes were prepared via single-screw extrusion. Annealing was performed after cooling the tapes, and this combination proved to increase the modulus. Characterization of the composites was carri ed out using thermogravimetry, dynamic-force thermomechanometry, modulated-force thermomechanometry, and Fourier transform infrared imaging. Incorporation of polysiloxane elastomer increased the mobility of PP during extrusion. Elongation at break increased with increasing polysiloxane content, while the tensile modulus was slightly decreased. The silica core within the polysiloxane particles provided an additional strength enhancement. Polar elastomers aided binding between PP and fillers, while enhancing strength and toughness. Glass transition temperature and segmental motion activation energy was shifted to higher temperature with addition of elastomer and filler, including kaolin and talc.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polypropylene (PP) composites</field><field name="subject">elastomers</field><field name="subject">filler particles</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100218.101808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeling unsure: a lived experience of humanbecoming</field><field name="creator">Maillard Struby, Francoise</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the phenomenon of feeling unsure as viewed from the humanbecoming school of thought.

This is particularly important in disaster response situations and military maneuvers where mobile personnel need to maintain direct contact with each other and the central control.  One of the factors that currently limits the effectiveness and practicality of these systems is portability. These systems require lightweight equipment that can be quickly and easily deployed and operated in a variety of environments. Parabolic dish antennas are the only antennas capable of providing the high gain required for direct satellite communication but their size and weight severely limit their portability and hence their use for portable direct satellite communication. Inflatable structures have been used in the space environment to overcome the limitations of launch vehicle size and weight restrictions. They are constru cted from thin film, or gossamer materials, and use internal pressure to maintain their shape. Inflatable structures are lightweight, have a low stowed volume and a high packing efficiency. It is proposed that this type of structure can be used to produce an inflatable parabolic dish antenna that can operate under terrestrial conditions to overcome the limits on portability for land-based communication. This thesis presents a design for a parabolic dish antenna and conical feed horn constructed entirely from polyester thin film. To further reduce the weight and stowed volume of the antenna the conical horn is fed by a microstrip patch. The performance of the components and their ability to operate under terrestrial conditions are assessed by comparing the results to those of an identical rigid system.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antenna</field><field name="subject">Inflatable</field><field name="subject">Portable</field><field name="subject">Satellite</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Lightweight</field><field name="subject">Gossamer</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100218.143609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A journey with Woolum Bellum Koorie open door education (KODE) school.

The school is unique in that its curriculum is centred on the Gunnai/Kurnai language and culture of the traditional owners. The aim of this thesis is to describe and tell the history of Woolum Bellum School. My research questions are: 1. what led to the establishment of the Woolum Bellum KODE School? What are the critical success factors of the school attaining autonomy within the Victorian State Education system?       The story of Woolum Bellum and its journey is important in the context of sharing knowledge. It exemplifies how a school like Woolum Bellum can be autonomous and how it presents a challenge as it comes to terms with what works and why. As a community we can assess the overall success of the school in terms of outcomes for the community. The benefits are seen in the generation of young people who attended the school over the past fifteen years. Their experience of schooling at Woolum Bellum as opposed to their experiences in the mainstream system amounts to significant successes.       My ways of knowing have informed how I have used a method of research that respects my knowledge gifted from my Elders and Ancestors. My indigenous ways respected in using Dadirri as a methodology for narrative inquiry in research underpins and informs respect for honouring an indigenous paradigm; with tools within that paradigm to guide and shape my research. My cultural ways of knowing, my guidance in reciprocal and respectful relationships, talking together in circles, telling stories in conversations, and understanding community are at the core of these ways of knowing.       My quilts crafted with multiple layers of knowledge offer the community a visual representation of the journey. They share the narrative and knowledge in conversations and in stories. They are relational and interrelated and they interpret the issues from my ways of knowing.      This is a story I have shared with others already who believed in the possibilities for a Woolum Bellum School. Like me, they welcomed the challenges, the responsibilities that came with it to our community and Elders. And like me, the community held on to the dream that time and through listening, through learning and with knowledge, the possibility remains.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal education</field><field name="subject">Indigenous paradigm</field><field name="subject">narrative inquiry</field><field name="subject">ways of knowing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100218.160033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bits and pieces: crafting architecture in a post-digital age</field><field name="creator">Roke, Rebecca Christina</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how designs based on a conjunction between craft and digital techniques may offer new possibilities for an architect or designer in contemporary practice. How is it relevant that what initially appear to be two distinct approaches to designing and making can be introduced to each other and coalesce to form a constructive attitude of mutually borrowed logic? The thesis champions the crafting of innovative design and the incorporation of digitally derived procedures that allow for globally efficient dissemination and malleability. Such procedures have occupied the practice of architecture and design for some time, giving rise to the current sobriquet of a 'post-digital age'. I propose that at this point in time we can usefully speculate on the relationship between physical making and computer-based production.      Too often the stylistic overtures popularly attached to the terms 'digital' and 'craft' narrow our perception of what each term may encompass and how they are likely to manifest. Traditionally, digitally derived design practice is attributed the efficiency of a mathematically precise mode of operation - an oscillation between zeroes and ones that produces a universal logic of smoothly rendered forms. By contrast, 'craft' is often cast into the realm of amateurish making, complete with mistakes, dropped stitches, fingerprints or other traces of human fault that are understood as being charming in the context of handmade human endeavour yet fall short when measured against 'serious' artistic categories that include architecture, design and fine art.      This thesis seeks to move beyond such accepted and somewhat polarised positions. First, the thesis offers clearer and more dynamic definitions of the terms 'craft' and 'digital', seeking the ability for each to hold fast to the inherent merits of their particular logic while also finding productive opportunities to integrate with each other. Second, the thesis examines how crafted production can combine with digital tools to offer a useful direction for contemporary design practice. Case studies of contemporary architects' and designers' works are drawn on to illustrate and make observations on the different relationships that the selected practitioners have discovered in their projects, all of which conjoin the conception and manifestation of digital craft. The case studies vary in scale from fabric and furniture production to large-scale installations of significant spatial effect, to entire architectural projects. The range is useful in discussing how the concept of digital craft in architecture can be re ad from various perspectives. This reflects the numerous ways in which digitally created design is used to realise crafted results and is mindful of the fact that architectural processes often follow technological innovation first practiced at more intimate scales such as in industrial design. It is also interesting to compare the idea of the more intimately scaled relationship that craft has traditionally held with architectural practice. Finally, the thesis will speculate upon future developments for the conjunction of digital craft in architecture and design, and will pose several questions for further discussion.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craft</field><field name="subject">Post-digital</field><field name="subject">Bricolage</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Pattern</field><field name="subject">Doshi Levien</field><field name="subject">Thomas Heatherwick</field><field name="subject">GTF</field><field name="subject">Hella Jongerius</field><field name="subject">Minifie Nixon</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100219.103357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation and evaluation of novel drug alginate granule systems using paracetamol as model drug</field><field name="creator">Mukhopadhyay, Debashis</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aim of this thesis was to investigate a novel method of preparing crosslinked alginate matrices. Current methods use large quantities of water and hence are not suitable for large scale manufacturing of drug alginate particulate systems. Moreover, the current processes offer little scope for control of the crosslinking process. The aim was to overcome these problems through studies of paracetamol alginate granular matrices prepared by the novel method and to explore if these granules could be used to improve the taste of paracetamol. 
 Methods: The novel method involves preparation of dried drug alginate granules (moisture content: &lt;5-6 %) using conventional granulation followed by crosslinking treatment of the dried granules with calcium chloride or a combination of calcium and magnesium ion solution in a crosslinking bath. The effect of the process (shear rate, binder quantity) to prepare untreated granules, composition of the raw materials (drug particle size and type of alginate) and subsequently the crosslinking treatment process variables (Ca&#65533;&#8314; ion concentration, agitation rate, time and temperature of Ca&#65533;&#8314; solution) on the physicochemical properties of granule systems were studied using factorial designs together with supporting studies. 
 The granules were characterized using sodium and calcium content analysis, drug release studies (mainly sub-60s release) matrix swelling rate and equilibrium swelling studies, tensile strength studies, ion permeation studies, SEM and X Ray analysis and gravimetric studies. Sensory studies correlating sub-60 s drug release (determined using a specially designed apparatus) and human taste scores (measured using an analogue scale) were then undertaken. Selected formulations were evaluated for taste improvement and to determine if mucoadhesion led to an increased unpalatability of paracetamol. 
 Results: Of the crosslinking treatment factors, the calcium concentration had the greatest effect on crosslinked granules. Although other treatment factors also affected the granule properties, alteration of the salt concentration allowed considerable control over the crosslinking process (not possible in the conventional method) in addition to providing a mechanistic understanding of the crosslinking process in the dried state. The use of low calcium concentrations (&lt; 20 mg/ml, CaCl&#8322;. 2H&#8322;O) during treatment led to granule erosion (hence drug loss) due to overall incomplete crosslinking but led to a reduction in the short-term drug release compared to the granules treated with intermediate (100- 250 mg/ml) or high calcium concentrations (&gt;400 mg/ml) due to reduction in the granule porosity after crosslinking. Although intermediate calcium concentrations led to complete crosslinking and longer release times (T 85 %: 25 min) high calcium crosslinking restricted the crosslinking to the surface of the granules leading to faster drug release (T 85 %: 8 min) with low calcium granules showing intermediate crosslinking and drug release rates (T 85 %: 18 min). High calcium treatment limited drug loss during crosslinking (95 % recovered compared to 83 % recovery at intermediate calcium concentration) without affecting the short-term drug release much. Low calcium granules showed the lowest drug recovery (&lt; 70 %) and slowest sub-60s drug release followed closely by intermediate and high calcium treated granules. 
 The granule preparation factors (shear rate, binder quantity) and type of alginate used, considerably affected the sub-60s drug release by affecting surface porosity especially when a low shear rate was used. However, these factors only slightly reduced the drug loss during crosslinking treatment phase (about 4 % increase in drug recovery). Smaller drug particle size had a slightly larger incremental effect on drug recovery (about 8 % increase in the drug recovery) during crosslinking treatment due to better embedding of the drug particles inside the untreated granule matrix. This was true as long as the particle size of the drug was &gt; 98 [mu]m. Below this size drug recovery remained unaffected by changes in drug particle size. Although granule surface porosity considerably affected the sub-60s drug release, its effect on drug release (long-term) was much less. 
 A linear correlation was observed between the sub-60s drug release and sensory scores despite high individual variability. Both granule formulations evaluated showed taste improvement and mucoadhesion did not lead to an increase in the bitter taste of the uncrosslinked paracetamol alginate granules. 
 Conclusions: Unlike the traditional method, the new technique of preparation of crosslinked drug alginate particulate systems uses very little water and allows greater control over the the crosslinking process compared to the swollen state crosslinking. The novel process of preparation is versatile, and should be scalable. It offers the formulator a platform to prepare a matrix, reservoir or a combination of these two systems using alginates and other drugs and polymers as well. Adequate short-term control over paracetamol release, very little loss of paracetamol during treatment (&lt; 5 % loss), reduction in mucoadhesion of the granules and lastly improvement of the taste of paracetamol is possible using alginate based systems especially if high calcium is used during the crosslinking treatment. Hence, it is likely that these taste-improved granules could be used to prepare tablets without the need for a protective film coating to improve taste. Finally, this research established the utility of short-term drug release in taste improvement research and characterization of solid controlled release dosage forms.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">granular materials</field><field name="subject">acetaminophen</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.143431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of haem availability on the viability of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, following exposure to reactive oxygen species</field><field name="creator">Mackie, Tasha A</field><field name="description">Objectives: This investigation adapted the LIVE/DEAD&#65533; Baclight[TM] bacterial viability stain for the quantitative determination of bacterial cell viability of the aerotolerant anaerobes Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611. The Live/Dead stain was used to determine the influence of haem availability on the resistance of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and compare the sensitivities between the haem-requiring periodontal bacteria to ROS. Neutrophils use oxidative and non-oxidative killing mechanisms. During phagocytosis, neutrophils kill bacteria via a respiratory burst, producing ROS. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia are oxygen-tolerant gram-negative bacteria found in the gingival crevice. These bacteria express superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which extends some protection against superoxide radicals. 
 Methods: Initially, experiments were performed to validate the reliability and accuracy of the fluorogenic Live/Dead stain using Escherichia coli ATCC 10798 (K-12), followed by experiments using P. gingivalis. The Live/Dead stain distinguishes viable:non-viable proportions of bacteria using mixtures of green (SYTO 9) and red (propidium iodide) fluorescent nucleic acid stains respectively. Bacterial cell viability was assessed with fluorescence microscopy and subsequently quantitative measurement using a fluorescence microplate reader (BMG Fluorostar plus Optima). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia colonies were subcultured from frozen cultures, in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco) and incubated anaerobically for approximately five days. They were further subcultured in pre-reduced TSB, supplemented with menadione 0.5[mu]g/ml (TSB-M) and either 5 [mu]g/ml haemin (Haem 5), 50 [mu]g/ml haemin (Haem 50) or without supplemental haemin (Haem 0). Cultures were grown anaerobically at 37&#65533;C to early stationary phase (approximately 48 hours). For experimental purposes, bacteria were harvested, washed and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing peptone (TBS-P) (0.1 mg/ml), with a final adjustment to OD&#8325;&#8324;&#8320; [approximately equals] 2.0 (which corresponds to 1 x 10&#8313; bacteria/ml). Bacterial suspensions were diluted ([approximately equals] 10&#8312;/ml) into TBS-P containing the fluorogenic viability stain (BacLight, Molecular Probes). Either pyrogallol (0.02 - 2 mM) or hydrogen peroxide (0.01 - 100 mM) was added (except to control tubes); tubes were vortexed for ten seconds and incubated at 37&#65533;C. Viability was monitored fluorimetrically for three hours. 
 Results: For both P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, a pyrogallol concentration of 0.2 mM resulted in 80 to 90% cell death; and a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 10 mM killed approximately 80 to 90% of cells. Irrespective of the haem status, no significant difference was determined between the overall maximum rate of killing of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, in their response to either superoxide or hydrogen peroxide; with the exception that the P. intermedia Haem 0 group was significantly less susceptible to hydrogen peroxide than the P. gingivalis Haem 0 group. For the majority of the experiments, there was no significant difference between final bacterial cell viability in the Haem 0 and Haem 5 cells for both species, after 3 hours exposure to various concentrations of ROS. However, the Haem 50 cells showed a significant increased susceptibility (albeit, a small difference) to both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. 
 Conclusions: The Live/Dead bacterial viability stain provided a valuable method to monitor "real-time" killing, avoiding the difficulties associated with culture-based methods for assessing viability. Haem availability had no clear influence on the resistance to ROS of either P. gingivalis or P. intermedia Haem 0 and Haem 5 cells. The Haem 50 cells showed a very slight increase in susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide. Although P. intermedia may be isolated in significant numbers from healthy gingivae, as well as from periodontally diseased sites, it was no more resistant to ROS than was P. gingivalis, which is associated with periodontal lesions and difficult to cultivate from relatively healthy (more oxygenated) sites. This suggests that resistance to ROS does not contribute to the ecological distinction between these two species. The finding that haem availability did not influence sensitivity implies that these bacteria do not accumulate haem for the purpose of protection from ROS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porphyromonas gingivalis</field><field name="subject">prevotella intermedia</field><field name="subject">active oxygen</field><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="subject">hydrogen peroxide</field><field name="subject">bacterial</field><field name="subject">cell surfaces</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071211.104926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Douglas Sirk, aesthetic modernism, and the culture of modernity</field><field name="creator">Evans, Victoria Louise</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, I argue that Douglas Sirk was attempting to dissolve the boundaries of the cinematic medium by assimilating elements of avant-garde art, architecture and design into the colour, composition and settings of many of his most popular studio produced films. While the exaggerated artifice of this director&#65533;s formal style has often been remarked upon, it has yet to be interpreted in the light of his detailed cognisance of the major art and architectural movements of the period, which include German Expressionist painting and Machine Age Modernist design. This is a lacuna that my thesis should at least partially fill, since I have shown that Sirk&#65533;s highly self conscious visual approach was deeply influenced by the artistic debates that were taking place in Europe during the 1920s and &#65533;30s and in America after World War II. To my mind, there is no doubt that this director&#65533;s syncretic mise-en-sce&#768;ne was the result of an interdisciplinary, transnational dialogue, and I have sought to illuminate some of the social, philosophical and political meanings that it seems to convey.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Douglas Sirk (1897-1987)</field><field name="subject">criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">motion picture producers and directors</field><field name="subject">California</field><field name="subject">Hollywood (Los Angeles)</field><field name="subject">motion pictures</field><field name="subject">modernism (aesthetics)</field><field name="subject">avant-garde (aesthetics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080707.122544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetic brandscapes</field><field name="creator">Wijland, Roel</field><field name="description">&#65533;Every poet who takes language seriously is working against a culture of clear marketable meanings and commodified production&#65533; states New Zealand novelist, essayist and poet Gregory O&#65533;Brien. This statement is the motivation for research that is explored in a collaborative ethnographic study of brand culture perceptions in New Zealand. It takes its inspiration from The Poetics of Space (Bachelard, 1978) and provides intimate lyrical insights into the experience of brands and brandscapes. 
 Gregory O&#65533;Brien describes the artists that inspire him as: &#65533;Those who resolutely stand on their own creative terms, working towards their own objectives, as oblivious as they can be to any market forces.&#65533; O&#65533;Brien&#65533;s observations are relevant to the research project in two essential ways: first to cast light on a shared cultural commodity construct such as a brand from its proposed opposite cultural site of individual imagination and secondly, to accept the poetic in the form of the undiluted voice of vocational poets as valuable media in their own right to achieve insightful interpretations. Critical marketing projects have the duty to generate an alternative &#65533;marketing gaze&#65533; sufficient to the task of &#65533;revelation&#65533; (Brownile &amp; Hewer, 2007). With regards to individual artists and poets specifically, critical marketing concepts implicitly pose the main research question as to the scenarios that are conceivably available to consumers: how does &#65533;working against marketable meanings&#65533; imaginatively work? 
 The project proposes the new construct of co-imagination as the co-active mental and spiritual engagement of consumers with the cultural artefacts of brandscapes that invite individual meaning making. It substantiates this individuality in a poetic evocation of brandscapes by thirteen artists. It analyses the holistic imaginative process on the basis of mental models, strategic scenarios and evocative aesthetics, in order to assess how talented consumers work against marketable meaning. It subsequently offers the relationship of co-imagination with existing co-optive concepts in marketing, literature and consumer behaviour, such as co-creation (Prahalad &amp; Ramaswamy, 2004), co-performance (Deighton, 1992) and co-duction (Booth, 1988). It results in a collaborative artistic inquiry that assembles individual evocations of enchantment and disenchantment with the beauty and ugliness of brandscapes, through newly created poetry. The research introduces the new concepts of aesthetic scarcity and aesthetic community and in its collaborative method of inquiry offers an alternative to a poetic tradition in consumer behaviour of the poet / researcher conflation (Sherry &amp; Schouten, 2002). As a result, the project complements the understanding of the individual meaning-making process in brand culture and is relevant to both practitioners and researchers in consumer behaviour and brand strategy. 
 The design of the project included a four month research journey that covered the North and the South Island of New Zealand with the objective of meeting a variety of poets in their local inspirational environments and brandscapes and catalyse an unusual creative cooperation of highly individual radical artists. In the thick description and analyses of the extensive field research, the project implicitly adds to existing work on brand culture (Schroeder, Salzer Morling, &amp; Askegaard, 2006), brand aesthetics (Saizer-Mo&#776;rling &amp; Strannega&#778;rd, 2004) and the relationship between artists and brands (Schroeder, 2005). 
 The research includes design elements based on romantic pragmatism (Rorty, 2007a) and cognitive aesthetics (R. H. Brown, 1977), both post-romantic concepts that explore aesthetic perception as perspectival knowledge and aesthetic distance as a means to transcend the dichotomy of objectivity and subjectivity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">brand name products</field><field name="subject">poets</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080716.144516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing teachers&#65533; theory and practice in literacy teaching</field><field name="creator">Thornley, Christina</field><field name="description">In recent years, professional development programmes that have been made available to teachers in New Zealand and other western countries have not often achieved the desired outcomes of improved teacher practice and decision making, or increased student achievement. The professional development research literature implies that the reason for this situation, is the inadequacy of programmes that do not acknowledge the teacher as a learner with individual knowledge, experience and priorities for their learning. As resources and attention continue to be focused on improving curriculum policies and classroom decision making to enhance student literacy achievement and reduce disparities, it is important to continue the search for teacher learning opportunities that achieve the desired goals. 
 While teachers have often been viewed as knowledge recipients, the research literature alerts readers to the dearth of knowledge to inform the decision making in classrooms and in the wider realms of schooling and education. Moreover, teachers have often been positioned simply as the subject of research that once published appears to have little bearing in their work. Developing Teachers&#65533; Theory and Practice in Literacy Teaching is a study of four teachers and a facilitator, who is also the researcher, engaging in four teacher researcher partnership projects. The aim of these projects was to provide the teachers with professional learning opportunities while simultaneously producing knowledge about literacy teaching and learning. 
 This alternative approach to professional development sought to investigate the outcomes of teacher researcher partnership projects, each designed by individual teachers who worked with the facilitator to address their self-identified &#65533;questions about practice&#65533;. The facilitator and the teachers worked together over a fifteen month period during which time they had individual and group meetings to learn about the research process and to design and implement their individual projects. The facilitator as researcher, gathered data from the teachers using qualitative methods and the teachers in turn gathered their own data to inform the progress and outcomes of their projects. 
 While there were a number of factors that contributed to the outcomes of each project, the way in which the facilitator and the teachers conducted their projects and managed the partnership was central to the success of the teacher learning and their ability to produce findings to inform curriculum decision making. The teachers&#65533; and facilitator&#65533;s knowledge of the theory and practice of research, literacy and professional learning were shown to be important. It is argued that in order to produce and disseminate knowledge, a body of prerequisite knowledge that transcended that which would previously be expected of the teachers and of the facilitator, had to be acquired. 
 The study recommends that further attention be given to such partnership projects as a means to increment the knowledge about teaching and learning, at the same time that teachers learn and improve their curriculum decision making. The teacher researcher partnership project approach that was implemented is discussed and analysed and an alternative &#65533;four tier&#65533; approach is advocated as more likely to result in the production and dissemination of information to enhance the curriculum of the classroom.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading teachers</field><field name="subject">in-service training</field><field name="subject">literacy</field><field name="subject">reading (primary)</field><field name="subject">english language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081205.084524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmotic and desiccation stress-tolerance of Serratia entomophila</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Tamsin</field><field name="description">Serratia entomophila, the causative agent of amber disease, is an endemic bacterium used for the biocontrol of New Zealand grass grub larvae. Although the available biopesticide is effective, its use is limited to areas where sub-surface application is feasible, and is also impacted by soil conditions such as moisture levels and osmolarity. The aim of this study was to elucidate the responses of S. entomophila to osmotic and desiccation stresses in relation to challenges encountered during production, storage and soil application, with the goal of developing a more robust and versatile biocontrol agent. 
 RpoS is a key factor in the stress response of many enteric bacteria. In order to dissociate the effect of RpoS from subsequent cellular stress studies, an rpoS mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Assessment of the rpoS mutant showed that RpoS was not implicated in NaC1 or desiccation tolerance of S. entomophila. The rpoS mutant was instead found to have enhanced salt tolerance and could be distinguished from the wild-type by the ability to ferment arabinose, a phenotype that was confirmed through complementation. Complete abolition of the amber disease process was observed using an rpoS strain also missing the Sep virulence genes, suggesting that RpoS is a regulator of the S. entomophila anti-feeding prophage (Afp). These findings indicate a subtle interplay between NaC1 tolerance, virulence and RpoS-mediated regulation of amber disease in S. entomophila. 
 A transposon mutagenesis screen was carried out to identify genes associated with NaC1 tolerance in S. entomophila. Fourteen mutants displaying NaC1 sensitivity were identified, two of which had mutations in genes with potential implications for the formulation of the bacterium as a biocontrol agent. The gene leuO that encodes a LysR-family transcriptional regulator was found to be essential for S. entomophila NaC1 tolerance. The toxicity of increased cellular LeuO from an over-expression vector led to the investigation of the effects of leuO mutation on the proteome. Multiple protein changes observed by two-dimensional gel analysis suggested that LeuO may be a global regulator in S. entomophila, as has been hypothesised for Salmonella species. A second NaC1-sensitive mutant contained an insertion in afp15, the product of which is thought to be involved in assembly of the Afp. As well as being sensitive to NaC1, the afp15 mutant was unable to induce the anti-feeding component of amber disease, again highlighting the link between stress tolerance and virulence in S. entomophila. 
 This study also determined that pre-exposure to NaC1 in conjunction with the provision of exogenous glycine betaine significantly enhanced the survival of S. entomophila either in a desiccated state or after application to soil, regardless of the soil moisture content. The implication of this finding on the future formulation of S. entomophila led to investigation of the underlying genetic mechanisms involved in glycine betaine synthesis and NaC1 tolerance. The genes involved in glycine betaine biosynthesis from choline were identified through genomic comparison, degenerate PCR and primer walking. A 6.5 kb region was sequenced and found to contain four genes with homology and similar chromosomal arrangement to the E. coli bet genes (betTIBA). The S. entomophila betIBA genes comprised an operon, flanked by the divergently-transcribed betT gene whose product is responsible for choline transport. To ascertain the relative transcription levels of components of the bet operon, quantitative RT-PCR was performed. Results of qRT-PCR showed that choline in conjunction with NaC1 induced the greatest levels of bet gene transcription, and that levels of the betA transcript were significantly lower than those of the other bet genes. Examination of the betA 5&#65533; non-coding region identified a previously undetected hairpin region, possibly accounting for the observed decrease in betA transcript levels. 
 The findings of this study have significantly advanced our understanding of how S. entomophiia responds to stress, and will contribute to the development of formulation strategies for the production of a robust product capable of application to pasture by a range of teclmiques. In addition, there is significant potential to utilise these findings in the development of other bacterial inocula for a range of biotechnological applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Serratia entomophila</field><field name="subject">grass grub</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081208.114925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dance at the seventeenth-century Danish court</field><field name="creator">Kjaergaard, Mette</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the culture and practice of dance in Denmark in the seventeenth century, focussing on the performance practice within festivals, the pervading French influence and philosophical discourse of dance. 
 The repertoire of staged court dance in Denmark comprises ballets and plays performed in conjunction with festival events such as coronations, weddings, and christenings. Typical is the 1634 festival in honour of Prince-Elect Christian and Magdalena Sibylla&#65533;s wedding in Copenhagen, a celebration of international significance. Subsequent celebrations during the reigns of Frederik III and Christian V followed similar models. The festival of 1655 in homage of Prince Christian, for example, gave rise to performances of the ballet Unterschiedliche Oracula, and the German-language opera Arion. The programmes from these performances, along with other contemporary descriptions, provide evidence of aspects of the ballet genre, stage construction, machinery, characters, allegory and political themes. The Danish productions, which also include an equestrian ballet, are in many respects comparable to French court ballets produced from the beginning of the century. 
 Evidence that French choreographies were known in Denmark is clearly provided by choreographies in the publication Mai&#770;tre de Danse (Glu&#776;ckstadt 1705) and the Danish manuscript of violin dance tunes Additamenta 396 4&#65533;. Evidence that the Danish aristocracy actively sought and coveted French culture can be found as early as the wedding festival in 1634 and well into the eighteenth century. French acculturation is evident elsewhere too, such as in Ludvig Holberg&#65533;s comedy Jean de France (1722), in a translation of French dance etiquette for youth, in contemporary accounts of French clothing and language, and by the employment of French musicians and dancing masters at the Danish court. 
 Included is an examination of Andreas Schroder&#65533;s treatise De Saltatoribus (Flensburg 1622) and Thomas Bartholin&#65533;s dance chapter in his book Qu&#65533;stiones Nuptialis (Copenhagen 1670) as significant Danish primary sources. These sources are placed in contrast with contemporary European dance manuals such as Arbeau, De Lauze, Esquivel de Navarro, Caroso and Negri. Danish and other European authors differ in their views on the morality of dance, although they cite many of the same Ancient and Biblical sources for their persuasive arguments. 
 Just as Denmark was connected to other countries of northern Europe in a complex political web, so too did these courts share artistic and cultural traditions, which are reflected in the sources related to dance. Danish dance practices can especially be demonstrated to be akin to those of neighbouring German courts, which, like Denmark, imitated the dance fashions of France.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dance</field><field name="subject">Denmark</field><field name="subject">court and courtiers</field><field name="subject">17th century</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081127.161219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand&#65533;s adventure culture : In Hillary&#65533;s steps : a Bourdieusian exploration</field><field name="creator">Kane, Maurice J</field><field name="description">Historically adventure has been associated with successful, yet, dangerous endeavours that expand the knowledge, wealth, reputation, or safety of society. Previous research would suggest that the practices and stories of adventure have guided and benchmarked societal morals and ideas considered common &#65533;truths&#65533;. In New Zealand, society&#65533;s understandings of adventure are entwined with a mythologised cultural identity based on the egalitarian minded and physically active, outdoor pioneering male. These ideals were complimented and presented as a global representation of New Zealand by Sir Edmund Hillary&#65533;s successful climb of Mount Everest in 1953. The purpose of this thesis is to examine New Zealand&#65533;s understandings of adventure since 1953. The thesis centres its enquiry on a group of individuals who have obtained social distinction as adventurers, seeking to scrutinize in their adventure practice and narratives, adventure understandings that are legitimised or invalidated. 
 Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu&#65533;s theoretical concepts guide the enquiry approach. Bourdieu sought to transcend the false antinomy of sociology that presented dualist perspectives, such as the individual and society, conceptualising all practice in a dynamic matrix of relational social space. The individuals with distinction as adventurers personify the socially recognised and valued features of adventure. Equally, however, an amalgamation of features does not infer a definitive understanding. The substance of understandings, Bourdieu suggests, is in the relational strategies, consistencies, transformations, and knowing misrecognitions that frame the features of a practice in a social space. The research process adopted to examine the adventure understandings was a biographical narrative approach. The contention of this approach being, that in stories of life experience individuals with adventure distinction construct self and social meaning. 
 The published autobiographical adventure narratives, media interviews, and related accounts of 12 New Zealand adventurers provided the initial research material. Additionally, nine of the adventurers took part in research interviews. The interpretation of the research material was framed by three of Bourdieu&#65533;s prominent conceptual ideas; the development of &#65533;habitus&#65533;, the struggle for &#65533;capital&#65533; in the field of adventre and the legitimacy of &#65533;distinction&#65533;. This interpretation was facilitated by theories related to adventure and leisure practice, the risks and contexts of adventure, and to individual, subcultural, and social identity. 
 By applying a Bourdieusian lens on the practice and narratives of New Zealand adventurers with distinction, this thesis illuminates new aspects of New Zealand&#65533;s cultural understandings of adventure. It revealed a contested and relational struggle to have some practices legitimised as adventure and others devalued as contrived common thrills, or fortuitously survived reckless epics. A practice that typifies the thrill spectrum is &#65533;Bungy Jumping&#65533;, the contemporary global representation of adventure in New Zealand. In regard of epic practices, topical through the period of adventure interviews was the 2004 motion picture &#65533;Touching the Void&#65533;. Although this involved English climbers in South America in the 1980s, it has retained global prominence as a modern adventure/survival epic. The interpretation of this contested adventure space details the valued and recognised features that construct New Zealand&#65533;s understandings of adventure. The findings also provide an empirical basis for the equally valued misrepresented adventure understandings related to injury, exclusivity, and normalisation of practice. Additionally, the research interpretation indicates the potential for transformation of adventure understandings. Finally, although the study is situated within a specific social and historical context, it contributes to the on-going exchange of meanings about adventure, especially in relation to outdoor practice, in contemporary society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002)</field><field name="subject">sports and tourism</field><field name="subject">outdoor recreation</field><field name="subject">adventure and adventurers</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090422.141858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation : a Taiwan perspective</field><field name="creator">Imrie, Brian C</field><field name="description">In order to successfully implement service internationalisation, a detailed knowledge of the target foreign culture is required (e.g., beliefs, values, lifestyles, symbols, psycholinguistics, and attitudes). This information may be used to manage the alignment of service offerings with local tastes, and create perceptual stimuli to foster trust and encourage consumption (Fugate 1996). Credible tools are therefore required to provide the market intelligence required to understand the cultural context and inform adaptation to local preferences. Service quality modelling and measurement perform such a role in reporting customer perceptions of the effectiveness of service marketing effort. However consideration of culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation has hitherto received only periphery attention within the literature. While numerous researchers have examined the role that values play as an antecedent of the service quality construct (e.g., Donthu and Yoo 1998; Furrer et al. 2000; Mattila 1999; Winsted 1997) there are no published studies adopting a more comprehensive view of culture&#65533;s role. 
 The widespread adoption of values as a proxy for understanding culture&#65533;s influence upon the service quality construct appears flawed as there is no theoretical justification to isolate values from the rest of the cultural field (Bourdieu 1990; Radcliffe-Brown 1949). Values alone, such as Hofstede (1984a) and Schwartz and Bilsky&#65533;s (1987) schemas, cannot fully explain how individual consumers reconcile their individual preferences with broader cultural influences (e.g., institutions, beliefs, regulations, and artefacts). In this study Bourdieu&#65533;s (1986) structuralist perspective of culture is utilised as a framework to explore how culture influences service quality. In this perspective the social world is viewed as being comprised of rules and systems that guide/inform an individual&#65533;s behaviour. Values are only one element of this social system. 
 In this study a case approach is adopted to map the role of culture in constructing service quality preferences. While the breadth of the research agenda means there is a large population of possible cases, Taiwan is selected as the case boundary principally due its logistical accessibility. Case selection in this study can therefore be classified as a convenience sample. However, to facilitate intensive study (Stake 2005) complexity is added to the case design through purposeful sampling (Patton 1990). In addition to seeking the perspectives of local Taiwanese outside perspectives are sought from expatriate New Zealanders and Taiwanese who have lived in New Zealand. Through purposive triangulation (Patton 1990) of both the sample underpinning the case and an interpretive multi-discipline analysis the researcher constructs a model of culture&#65533;s influence upon service quality evaluation within this case boundary. No evidence is found within either the primary data or critical literature review that Taiwanese culture has any impact upon the evaluation of service quality at the primary dimensional level (i.e., &#65533;Process/Outcome Quality&#65533;, and the &#65533;Personal Interaction Quality&#65533;). Indeed apriori modelling of the construct has similarly modelled how consumers separately evaluate interpersonal aspects from other key evaluative criteria (e.g., Dabholkar et al. 1996; Gronroos 1984). This level of the dimensional hierarchy is therefore tentatively determined to be etic (Pike 1967), subject to further cross-cultural studies. A moderate level of cultural influence was however noted amongst the second-order dimensions. Finally, the third and subsequent level indicators were widely found to display extensive cultural influence and require significant adaptation efforts for local cultural preferences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">consumers' preferences</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.154534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human migration in prehistoric Northeast Thailand</field><field name="creator">Cox, Katharine</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the scale of human migration in three prehistoric settlements in the Upper Mun River Valley (UMRV) Northeast Thailand, from c. 1700BC - AD500. Archaeological data implies migration may have had a central role in the development of agriculture and later metal technology in the region, which is suggested to show increased social complexity over this important stage in the development of states in mainland Southeast Asia. The scale of these migrations, however, are not known and based on archaeological evidence it is unclear whether there were large numbers of individuals migrating into the region in order to bring about the changes seen in the archaeological record. 
 Two potentially complementary-methods are used to identify the extent of migration in the UMRV in this thesis. The first method, the study of dental morphological traits, is used as an indication of genotype of 78 prehistoric individuals. The second method is isotope analysis of the dental enamel of 74 individuals, used as indicators of childhood residence and diet. Strontium (Sr), Carbon (C) and Oxygen (O) isotopes are analysed. The first method reflects an individual&#65533;s genetic heritage through inherited traits, while the second method is an indication of an individual&#65533;s migration during their lifetime. Together, these methods may provide a powerful means to assess the scale of migration over an extended period of time in this region. 
 As it has been posited that the introduction of agriculture is related to migration of people into the region, the current study hypothesises that while immigrants would be identified from outside the UMRV during all phases of occupation at the sites, this would be particularly so during the earlier phases. It is also hypothesised through analysis of the morphological traits that genetic relationships at each site could be suggested. Finally, it is also hypothesised that individuals with evidence for infectious diseases, which are otherwise rare in the region, would be immigrants. 
 The frequencies of the dental morphological traits at each site are calculated, and a local pattern for each site developed. The results from the morphological traits suggest low levels of migration into the UMRV, and overall group homogeneity. Despite this homogeneity, it is suggested that several individuals may have been from a different genetic pool to others at the sites, reflected in a different combination of dental traits. There is also some evidence for genetic relationships between individuals, and over time, possibly indicating familial relationships at the sites. 
 Stability in the Sr isotopes over time suggest a local signature for the UMRV. Sr isotopes did not support a hypothesis of large-scale immigration into the UMRV, as there were few isotopic outliers identified. Those individuals with clear outlier Sr results, and therefore probable immigrants, were predominately female. All phases of occupation of the UMRV attracted some long-range inward movement of people, although the data suggests long-range migration diminished over time. 
 [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C values show no significant change over time, possibly supporting the Sr data of limited migration into the region. While the interpretation of this isotope is primarily from a perspective of migration it is recognised that this may be limited to understanding variation in diet in the individuals. [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O values show significant change over time (p = 0.00, ANOVA), perhaps consistent with previous research which suggested increased aridity in the UMRV. An alternative explanation of the [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O data is that migration increased with time, with people who were differentiated by their O isotopes but not their Sr, however the increased aridity hypothesis is favoured here. 
 The hypothesis that individuals with evidence for infectious disease would be long-range immigrants into the region is rejected. None of the individuals who had physical evidence for infectious disease had chemical data to support their being immigrants. 
 The putative migrants to the UMRV are presented as case studies, assessing the complementarity of the methods used. It is argued that given the changes in the environment over time in the UMRV the area may have become less attractive to immigrants and as a result the communities may have become more insular. The data yielded from the two methods have demonstrated the value of using inherited dental traits together with isotopic data of individual migration for investigating human mobility in the past. Using these methods, this study shows that there were low levels of migration into the UMRV and that long-range migration was more frequent in the earliest phases of occupation in the region.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthropometry</field><field name="subject">ethnoarchaeology</field><field name="subject">human remains (archaeology)</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">prehistoric peoples</field><field name="subject">internal migration</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090626.150746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient dynamics during winter convection in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre</field><field name="creator">Walker, Carolyn Faye</field><field name="description">Storm-induced open-ocean convective mixing is one of the primary processes controlling the supply of nitrate to the sunlit layer of the oligotrophic North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NASG). Yet, the magnitude and timing of nitrate fluxes during winter convection is poorly understood due to an absence of targeted process studies. In the northwest NASG, multiple quasi-Lagrangian studies were conducted during the boreal winters of 2004 and 2005 in an effort to sample strong winter convection. During each of the time-series studies, inventories of vertically fluxed nitrate were quantified approximately every twelve hours using the distribution of helium isotopes ([delta]&#65533;He) and nitrate in the water column. This method is known as the Helium Flux Gauge Technique (HFGT).
Large variability in surface forcing and density structure of the upper ocean was observed between the two years; however, only winter 2005 experienced convective mixing to depths greater than 150 m. In winter 2004, mild atmospheric conditions coincided with a positive phase in the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), consistent with the dominant regime experienced during the previous decade. On average 36 &#65533; 9 mmol m[-2] of fluxed nitrate was inferred by excess &#65533;He in the mixed layer of the ocean during the winter 2004 study period. This inventory of physically transported nitrate is attributed to the sampling of waters laterally advected from nearby eddy features. The sampling of multiple water masses is likely due to the inability of the drogue to persistently follow water masses efficiently. Although physical evidence indicates spatial variability within the time-series data, the length scales of convective mixing appear to be greater than those associated with spatial aliasing as a result of drogue performance. This observation provides us with increased confidence that the objectives for the present study are not compromised by spatial variability in the data.
In contrast, winter 2005 experienced a negative NAO, strong physical forcing and convective mixing to depths &gt; 250 m. Two convectively modified water masses, most likely resulting from a single storm event, were sampled at different stages of development. These two water masses exhibit large variability in the magnitude of nitrate entrained in the convective layer from the thermocline. An average inventory of 247 &#65533; 56 mmol NO&#8323;[-]m[-2] was entrained in the rapidly expanding convective layer of the first water mass in the first few days following the storm approach. In contrast, ongoing entrainment of nitrate was absent from the second water mass, sampled two weeks later when the depth of the surface mixed layer was consistently ~ 300 m. These results indicate that surrounding fluid is entrained into the convective layer when it is actively expanding in the vertical. On the other hand, significant fluid entrainment does not occur at the base of the plume once sinking waters have reached a level of neutral buoyancy. The persistence of elevated nitrate stocks (~ 100 mmol m[-2]) in the convective layer two to three weeks after the inferred injection event, suggests sub-optimal nitrate uptake by resident phytoplankton. Phytoplankton growth was most likely resource limited by light or a micronutrient such as iron. Despite the implied biolimitation, changes in chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, indicate net production within the convective layer. On average, the convective layer was observed to support an inventory of 62 &#65533; 6mg chlorophyll-a m[-2], increasing at an average rate of 3.4mg m[-2] d[-1]. This inventory indicates a slow build-up of phytoplankton biomass to near bloom levels, ahead of the main spring bloom that typically follows formation of the seasonal thermocline near Bermuda. Net production in the convective layer was likely due to transient periods of increased (weak) surface stability that were observed to support high phytoplankton biomass, following the cessation of thermocline fluid entrainment.
When nitrate and excess &#65533;He in samples collected from the thermocline were regressed for the purpose of quantifying nitrate fluxes, the results showed that between 1.6 - 2.0 [mu]mol kg[-1] of dissolved nitrate was present during formation of the water mass. This suggests the source of this excess (above Redfield ratios) nitrate in the thermocline of the NASG is not local, and has ramifications for local nitrogen fixation budgets determined using geochemical approaches.

Moreover, little is known about factors associated with multiple birth capacity of the uterus which would be necessary to convert gains in ovulation rate to the birth of live lambs. This project has investigated the relationship between maternal uterine and hormonal environment as well as the heritability of embryonic survival (ES) in prolific ewes.
Litter size (LS) from known ovulation rate (OR) records (n=6393) collected over 16 years were analysed for heritability. ASReml analysis reported ES to be a trait of low repeatability (r&#65533; = 0.103) and heritability (h&#65533; = 0.04) which is consistent with earlier studies of this trait. However, pedigrees of outlier animals indicated a segregation pattern consistent with a single autosomal gene with a major affect on enhanced ES. From this flock, closely related high ovulation rate ewes with significantly different litter sizes (High ES; OR2.6/LS2.4 versus Low ES; OR2.9/LS1.6) were selected for further study.
The anatomy and gene expression of the uterus collected at day 14 of the oestrous cycle (n=5 High and n=5 Low ES ewes) and day 16 of gestation (n=14 high and n=10 Low ES ewes) as well as systemic concentrations of hormones indicative of uterine (activin-A, follistatin) and ovarian (inhibin-&#945;, progesterone) function during the oestrous cycle and early gestation were compared.
Progesterone concentrations were found to rise earlier in high ES ewes with a difference in number of ewes with detectable levels of progesterone apparent by day 4 of gestation. The peak concentration and slope of progesterone increase as well as plasma profiles of oestradiol and inhibin-&#945; were not different between groups.
A number of pathways worthy of closer investigation were implicated by microarray analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Pubmatrix, and candidate gene approaches. In particular, the altered expression of many immune cell factors suggests that high ES ewes have maternal gene expression of the inflammatory pathways favourable to embryo implantation.
The plasma concentration of activin, but not follistatin, was found to be significantly higher in low ES ewes, a difference that remained apparent when the concentration of follistatin was corrected for individual samples. Furthermore, the concentration of activin, but not follistatin, was significantly elevated on day 16 of gestation in the uterine fluid of low ES ewes.
Further investigation of the pattern of gene expression during the oestrous cycle and early gestation (day10-16 oestrus and days10-20 gestation) revealed that a significant increase in follistatin mRNA in the luminal epithelia and interacting trophoblast cells of the embryo occurs on day 18 and 20 of gestation. It is likely the appropriate balance between activin and follistatin during the time of implantation enhances embryonic survival in this line of ewes. This may be secondary to or concomitant with the observed earlier rise in progesterone concentration. The implication that embryo survival may be positively influenced by a single autosomal gene has important implications for New Zealand's agricultural industry.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">embryology</field><field name="subject">ewes</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">embryos</field><field name="subject">phenotype</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20091009.160105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of a back-support harness on the three dimensional kinematics and electromyography of the trunk in sheep shearers : implications for injury prevention</field><field name="creator">Schneiders, Anthony G.</field><field name="description">The occupation of sheep-shearing is classified as heavy to very-heavy physical work requiring a high level of energy expenditure while performing a repetitive task in a predominantly sustained trunk flexion posture. The task is further complicated by unpredictable animal behaviour. Shearing is considered to carry a high risk of injury particularly to the lumbar spine and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) in shearers is high relative to other occupations. The emergence of a commercial shearing-aid (Warrie Back-Aid TM) that is purported to decrease loading on the spine, reduce injury rate and alleviate symptoms of spinal origin has been welcomed by many sectors of the wool-harvesting industry. However, the precise biomechanical influence of the Warrie Back-Aid TM (WBA) on the sheep-shearing task has not been quantified. 
 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the WBA on three-dimensional kinematics and electromyography of the trunk for 12 experienced shearers during the occupational task of sheep-shearing. 
 Sheep-shearing is a highly patterned process comprised of specific interlinked phases. Nine distinct phases of the shearing-task where the harness was worn during the removal of the sheep&#65533;s fleece were investigated. The study used an opto-electronic motion analysis system and rigid body dynamic modelling. The shearer&#65533;s trunk and pelvis were considered as a series of three coupled rigid segments; pelvis, lumbar, and thorax with four passive retro-reflective markers defining each segment. The kinematic variables of angular displacement, velocity and acceleration at the thoraco-lumbar and lumbo-pelvic joint centres were calculated for each shearer while shearing with and without the WBA. An eight channel sEMG telemetry system was used to simultaneous record activity in four pairs of trunk muscles. Temporal analysis of the sEMG signal gave information on the duration and relative intensity of trunk muscle activity. 
 The results demonstrated that the task of sheep-shearing required endurance-based muscle activity and the adoption of quasi-static posturing combined with complex asymmetrical trunk motion for extensive periods of the task time. There was considerable variability in the trunk motion of individual shearers despite the pattern-taught and repeatable nature of the shearing task. The introduction of the WBA had no effect on the time taken to shear or trunk kinematics however it resulted in reductions in muscular activity of the trunk extensors. When the complete shearing task was analysed there was a statistically significant reduction in mean intensity of muscle activity for the left multifidus (p = 0.010), right multifidus (p = 0.001), right iliocostalis (p = 0.004) and right longissimus (p = 0.002) when the WBA was used. A reduction in muscular activity of the trunk extensors during the sheep-shearing task may result in a decrease in spinal loading, energy expenditure and muscular fatigue. 
 The clinical recommendation based on the biomechanical results of this and other studies is that the WBA should be incorporated into the practice of sheep-shearing to assist in the reduction of inherent risks associated with the shearing task. Prospective studies into the effect of the harness on LBP are required to endorse this recommendation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep shearers</field><field name="subject">back injuries</field><field name="subject">injury prevention</field><field name="subject">Warrie Back-Aid</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060803.160831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for virtual artifacts : digital images as teaching tools in Classical art</field><field name="creator">Rountree, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the problem of how to present digital images of ancient artifacts in a manner that supports the task of visual analysis. 
 The real object presents the "truth": exact scale, colour, and fine details. An original work of art provides the viewer with the opportunity to react directly with the object, is closest to the impact intended by the artist, and provides a tangible physical link with the past. Digital images limit and alter the experience of a work of art (1) with regard to the amount of data available (resolution), and (2) through the interpretation of the object by the producers of the digital copy (mediation). 
 A new framework is developed to improve the understanding and presentation of virtual artifacts. This Fidelity-Mediation framework provides a continuum for considering the effects of design strategies on media used in teaching Classical arch&#65533;ology. Two small-scale experiments and follow-up interviews were undertaken to assess the usefulness of the Fidelity-Mediation framework as a descriptive model. During the experiments, quantitative analysis could detect no statistical difference in the effectiveness of different types of presentation (real object, VR object, and still digital images). 
 This is a surprising result as it might be expected that there is nothing like seeing the real thing. Digital images provide less visual integrity. However, the digitised artifacts make up for the loss of excitement and authenticity by providing the advantage of mediated focus. Digitised artifacts thus turn out to be useful, effective study tools in the analysis of Classical art. 
 Findings from this research are expected to generalise only to learning situations which support task orientation--situations conducive to developing personal skills and mastery--in contrast to performance orientation where the goal is to display performance relative to others.

Difficulties with word retrieval have negative social implications as they can impact on the ability to converse with others. The overarching goal of this dissertation was to determine the underlying cause of problems with word retrieval after TBI. 
 To test word retrieval in this dissertation, participants were given a series of word fluency tasks and the speed of word generation was measured. In addition to measuring interresponse times, procedures used by Rohrer, Wixted, Salmon and Butters (1995) were also followed. This involved the calculation of parameter estimates to investigate whether slowed retrieval or degraded semantic stores were responsible for the patients&#65533; word retrieval difficulties. One parameter (N) was a measure of the total number of retrievable words and the second parameter (tau) was an estimate of mean latency. 
 Study 1 was designed to trial the procedure and equipment adopted throughout this dissertation to analyse speech. University students were presented with categories on a computer screen and asked to generate as many exemplars as possible in 60 seconds. A PowerLab Chart sound system was used to measure the time that each word was generated. The results of Study 1 showed that the methodology of previous research could be replicated using the PowerLab Chart sound system. 
 In Study 2, persons with postconcussion syndrome (PCS) and matched controls were given two word fluency tasks. Results showed that on both tasks patients recalled fewer words, had longer pauses between words, and took significantly longer to generate their first word than controls. Also, patients had a significantly reduced N relative to controls, but there was no difference in tau between patients and controls. Given that the participants had not finished responding and that parameter estimates require responses to be exhausted, Study 3 was designed to replicate the findings of Study 2 using an extended recall period. 
 In Study 3, patients with PCS and matched controls completed a series of word fluency tasks and were given extended periods of time to generate words. Results showed that the patients obtained significantly fewer words on two of the tasks, but no evidence of slowed retrieval was found. There was also no difference in the estimates of N and tau between patients and controls. As the patients in Study 3 sustained more minor injuries than those in Study 2, Study 4 tested patients with severe TBI. 
 In Study 4, patients with severe TBI and matched controls were given a series of word fluency tasks. Results showed that the patients generated fewer words and experienced slowed retrieval. Again, there was no difference in the estimates of N and tau between patients and controls. The results of Study 4 confirmed the hypothesis that slowed word retrieval is a consequence of TBI. Taken together, the results of this dissertation show that an underlying slowness of processing is the primary cause of problems with word retrieval in persons with TBI.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">brain damage</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">word retrieval</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060830.115029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School and personal factors associated with being a smoker</field><field name="creator">Darling, Helen Marie</field><field name="description">Most adult smokers begin smoking during adolescence; nicotine dependence can develop relatively quickly and, once established, most smokers smoke for approximately 40 years. For adolescents dependent upon nicotine, cessation interventions are not well established. It is, therefore, essential that public health interventions focus on preventing initiation and maintenance and decreasing the prevalence of youth smoking. In spite of legislation to protect New Zealand adolescents, a large proportion continues to use tobacco at least weekly. Recent surveys have shown a slight decrease in cigarette smoking prevalence, overall, but, no reduction and marked increases have been reported within some subgroups. 
 The overall aim of this research was to identify school and personal factors associated with secondary school students smoking. The specific research objectives included: a) identifying factors at the personal, family, peer, school and 'tobacco-genic' environment levels which were associated with regular and established cigarette smoking; b) describing the extent of smoke-free policy and health education programmes in secondary schools; and, c) evaluating the relations between cigarette smoking among students and potential protective factors, smoke-free policies and practices and health education programmes. 
 The research was based on data from 3,434 secondary school students from 82 schools. The multi-stage sampling procedures and data analyses ensured that the results were able to be generalised to the New Zealand secondary school student population. Smoking was more prevalent amongst girls for all measures of smoking frequency and significant differences were found for smoking prevalence between ethnic groups and school decile. 
 In terms of family influences, the smoking behaviours of parents were not associated with increased odds of smoking nor were perceived relationships between students and their parents, or exposure to SHS. In contrast, the smoking behaviour of siblings was associated with increased odds of smoking but it is likely that both student and sibling smoking are both influenced by the same processes within the family. Similarly, low levels of self-concept were not associated with increased odds for daily smoking. The smoking behaviour of a best friend was a pervasive risk factor as was a high level of disposable income, frequent episodes of unsupervised activities, and 'pro-smoking' knowledge. Being male, visiting a place of worship, and the intention to stay at school until after Year 13 reduced the odds of daily smoking among students. 
 Multilevel models were used to identify school level effects. After adjusting for student, family and school characteristics significant between-school variance in smoking prevalence remained and this suggests that there are factors, arguably beyond the immediate control of the student or family that may influence a student&#65533;s smoking behaviour. The presence of a school effect also supports the WHO concept of 'health promoting schools' in that schools can make a difference to health outcomes. Understanding how the health promoting schools model has been interpreted and implemented in NZ schools, along with critique of the implementation of the amended legislation making all schools smoke-free, would be a pertinent 'next-step' in identifying characteristics of schools which are associated with decreased tobacco use.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking</field><field name="subject">tobacco use</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">teenagers</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060830.120926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A feasibility study of occupational exposure and acute injury outcome information collection methods for New Zealand agricultural workers</field><field name="creator">Horsburgh, Simon</field><field name="description">Background: Agricultural workers in New Zealand have high rates of occupational injury compared to most other occupational groups. They are also over-represented in work-related fatal injury statistics. While it is recognised that the personal and social costs of occupational injuries to agricultural workers are considerable, the ability to develop and evaluate evidence-based injury control strategies for this group has been limited by the lack of quality information on occupational exposures and injury events. 
 Aim: The aim of this thesis was to develop and pilot a comprehensive occupational exposure and acute injury outcome data collection system for agricultural workers which will provide an evidence base for a public health approach to acute occupational injury control within the agricultural sector of New Zealand. The thesis objectives were therefore to: 
 * Develop study methods to collect occupational exposure and injury outcome information. 
 * Assess the likely validity of these study methods. 
 * Determine the feasibility of implementing the study methods. 
 * Suggest modifications to the study methods to enhance their validity and feasibility. 
 Methods: Pastoral farms in the Waitaki region of New Zealand were identified using a database of New Zealand farm owners. The owners and workers on these farms were contacted and asked to participate. Participants were required to complete an Initial Questionnaire which included items on farm and personal characteristics, the farm environment, training, safety perceptions and attitudes and safety behaviour. Participants were then monitored for six months. During the monitoring period each participant completed a monthly log of their work activities during the preceding week. Any work-related injuries to workers on participating farms were also recorded and reported monthly. Participants who were injured were followed up for an interview to obtain detailed injury event information. At the end of the monitoring period a second Questionnaire was administered to assess change during the study. Participants were asked about any occupational injury events during the study as part of one of the monthly logs and the second Questionnaire to provide a comparison measure to the monthly reports. A random third of participating farms were visited at the end of the study to assess the validity of participants&#65533; reports on the farm environment. 
 Results: Sixty-two farms were recruited into the study, a recruitment rate of 24%. This resulted in 82 study participants. Fifty-seven farms and 72 participants completed the study, resulting in retention rates of 92% and 88% respectively. Return of study items was high, with the lowest observed level of return being 92%. Levels of response error were low in most of the study items, with exceptions being the recording of the hours spent handling animals (37%) and total hours worked (22%). Most postal items (over 68%) were returned before a reminder call was made. 
 Participants&#65533; reports about the farm environment closely matched the observations made during the visits, with little evidence of significant misreporting. The validity of reported injury events during the study could not be determined, as the two methods of capturing injury events identified different events. 
 Conclusions: Within the limitations of the study, most of the study methods appeared to be feasible and have acceptable validity. The low recruitment rate and issues with validating the capture of injury events indicated that modifications to the study design were necessary to achieve acceptable validity and feasibility, however. Recommendations were made on how feasibility and validity might be improved.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural laborers</field><field name="subject">wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">industrial accidents</field><field name="subject">medical statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060831.110516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of medical students&#65533; communication skills throughout training : a longitudinal study</field><field name="creator">Brown, Nicola</field><field name="description">There is ample evidence that clinical communication skills deteriorate in medical students without specific training, but are improved by training. However, little is known about how well-equipped students are to communicate with patients on entering medical school, and there is limited evidence about whether all students improve with tuition in communication skills. This thesis describes a longitudinal study into these issues at the University of Otago&#65533;s Medical School. It was hypothesised that the majority of participants would demonstrate significant improvement in communication skills over their first two phases of specific tuition in communication. However, a small minority of participants were expected to fail to develop adequate skills in communication over this time, and the researcher wished to investigate whether any of the variables measured at baseline (demographic characteristics, personal qualities, academic abilities, and demonstrated interaction and interview observation skills) would predict those participants who developed superior communication skills, or who failed to demonstrate sufficient improvement by the end of eighteen months of medical education. 
 Participants were 232 new entrants to the Otago Medical School programme, who were evaluated at three time points over the first eighteen months of their medical training. After completing a range of baseline measures (including a pre-training videotaped interview with a simulated patient role-played by an actor), participants completed two phases of communication skills training and, at the end of each phase, undertook a further videotaped interview. Interviews were marked by trained raters, using a novel assessment tool, the Brown-Peace Interview Marking Schedule, developed specifically for this purpose. Actors and participants themselves also evaluated each interview. 
 Results showed that there was considerable variation in participants&#65533; abilities to perform the pre-training interview, indicating that the communication skills required in a clinical setting were not present in the majority of participants before training. Analysis of participant performance over time indicated that, while certain skills improved with training (e.g., receptive listening skills, non-verbal expression, and degree of structure in the interview) others did not improve significantly (e.g., responsiveness to the patient&#65533;s needs). As a group, participants benefited from the training, but a small sub-group of participants exhibited significant deficits in communication, even after two phases of communication skills training. It was easier to predict those participants who would develop superior communication skills than those who would continue to experience difficulties with simulated interviews. However, a small number of qualities (such as lack of familiarity with the English language, and high levels of personal qualities such as aloofness) were useful predictors of poor performance in the videotaped interviews. 
 Further research could clarify whether the same personal qualities influence student performance in later interviews, once students have had more experiential training and opportunities to practise interviewing in a range of settings. In terms of the practical implications of the research findings, a number of issues are highlighted, such as the range of skills required of those who teach and evaluate communication skills. Recommendations are made regarding the timing, content and implementation of communication skills training for medical students.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical students</field><field name="subject">medical education</field><field name="subject">communication in medicine</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070130.160535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rights of public access for outdoor recreation in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Booth, Kay Lenore</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the nature of public access rights for outdoor recreation in New Zealand. It aims to improve understanding of these rights by examining the New Zealand public policy framework for public access, the social constructions of access rights and the interaction of these dimensions via analysis of two contemporary New Zealand access issues: the foreshore access debate and the state-sponsored Land Access Review. An institutional arrangements framework forms the study&#65533;s conceptual basis and is critiqued for its value in the examination of rights of public access. Multiple qualitative methods were employed to collect data, including interviews with access actors, submission analysis, examination of public policy documents and critical interpretation of the access discourse within the mass media. Key themes from the international access literature are identified and the disparate nature of much of this research is highlighted. Within New Zealand, public access represents an area of research neglect. This thesis provides the first comprehensive study of rights of public access for outdoor recreation in New Zealand. 
 A threshold has been reached in the evolution of access rights in New Zealand. Societal changes are perceived to be reducing the public&#65533;s traditional rights to access land for outdoor recreation. Owing to the importance of these rights within conceptions of New Zealand national identity, the Government is codifying access rights in a bid to protect them. Thus a shift in access arrangements is occurring, from reliance upon social customs to increasing use of public policy instruments. 
 Access rights are being renegotiated within a highly contested environment. The debate is being staged within the political arena and via the national news media; access has become a significant national issue. As a result, the level of engagement has shifted from localised access transactions between landholders and recreationists, to a national discussion regarding competing rights to land. Access actors have reacted in different ways to the reforms of access arrangements, driven by the manner in which the proposals affect their property rights, social values and norms. Some reactions have been strident and confrontational. 
 Inadequate public policy arrangements for access have created the 'space' for these multiple social constructions of access to develop. Convergence of a disparate and poorly enforced access public policy framework with varying social representations of access rights is influencing the access outcomes. The 'place' of public access within New Zealand society occurs at the intersection of several strongly-held cultural traditions, including private property rights, Maori customary rights, and a belief that it is a birthright to freely access the outdoors. The tension between these values underpins New Zealand&#65533;s unique (and changing) manifestation of the rights of the public to access land for recreation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recreation areas</field><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">right of way</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070208.142035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movements, population dynamics and predatory behaviour of stoats inhabiting alpine grasslands in Fiordland</field><field name="creator">Smith, Derek</field><field name="description">Stoats are introduced mammalian carnivores implicated in the decline of several of New Zealand&#65533;s endemic species. Most research into stoats in New Zealand has focused on beech forest habitat, especially in years of peak stoat abundance following heavy beech seedfall and peak cohorts of mice. In New Zealand, alpine grasslands occur above the altitudinal limit of beech forest (900-1000 m a.s.l.). Although previous research has shown stoats to be present there, little is known about the ecology of stoats in alpine grasslands. This research aimed to test whether alpine grasslands were a marginal habitat occupied by surplus stoats that had spilled over from beech forest populations, i.e. a sink habitat. The alternative is that alpine grasslands are a desirable habitat deliberately exploited by stoats. This question was answered using mark-recapture, radio-tracking, diet analysis and a food addition experiment. Another objective was to determine whether nest survival is higher in alpine grassland compared to beech forest and whether stoats are likely to be a frequent predator of ground nests in alpine grasslands relative to other introduced mammals that inhabit them. If nest survival is higher in alpine grassland then alpine grasslands may be a refuge from predation. However, if it is not then it is important for management to know the relative risk posed by stoats compared with other predators. An artificial nest experiment was used to answer these questions. This research was undertaken during two years of low to intermediate beech seedfall and therefore provided an opportunity to look at the ecology of stoats in a New Zealand National Park outside years of peak abundance. The principal study site for this research was the Borland Valley, Fiordland National Park. 
 Compositional analysis showed that stoats in alpine grassland selected for it over adjacent beech forest. The range cores of these stoats were high up in alpine grassland away from the ecotone with beech forest. Stoats occurred at similar densities in alpine grasslands as they did in beech forest and observed survival was similar between the two habitats (with the exception of 2004 when it may have been higher in alpine grassland). The most frequent prey of stoats inhabiting beech forest were birds and mice. Although stoats in alpine grasslands also ate birds and mice their most frequent prey were ground weta and hare. Food addition appeared to cause diet switching but did not reduce the distances moved by stoats, suggesting that other factors may be more important in regulating their summer home range size in alpine grasslands. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that alpine grasslands in the Borland are not a marginal habitat for stoats, but may instead be a desirable one. Artificial nests had a higher probability of survival in alpine grassland compared to adjacent beech forest, but survival was too low to support the idea that alpine grasslands are a refuge. Stoats were the most frequent predator of artificial nests in both habitats, but 95 % confidence intervals overlapped the predation rate by possums, which was also high. 
 These findings illustrate the need for a comprehensive landscape approach to stoat control in montane National Parks, for two reasons: 1) endemic biodiversity in alpine grasslands may be under threat from stoat predation, 2) alpine grasslands may act as a source for dispersing stoats that reinvade lowland stoat control areas. In the absence of heavy beech seedfall and peak mouse abundance, stoats occurred at densities of around 1 km&#8315;&#65533; in both habitats and there was recruitment into these populations. This raises the important question: What regulates the distribution and abundance of stoats in years of low beech seedfall and low mouse abundance? In these years birds, ground weta and hares may be as important as mice are in years of peak abundance following heavy beech seedfall.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ermine</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">predatory animals</field><field name="subject">grassland ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fiordland National Park</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070330.160940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of expertise in face perception : processing configural information in own-race and other-race faces</field><field name="creator">Schuchinsky, Maria</field><field name="description">The effects of expertise, such as better recognition of own-race than other-race faces, have been attributed either to poor encoding of configural information (the dual-mode theory) or to representation of faces on dimensions attuned to own-race faces and, hence, inappropriate for coding of other-race faces (the ABC model). Neither framework alone has been able to account for the variety of past results. It is proposed that a composite account derived from the dual-mode theory and the ABC model may offer a more complete explanation of the effects of race. To evaluate the composite account, six experiments using perceptual paradigms were carried out. 
 The structure of face space and the effects of expertise on configural processing were assessed in a dissimilarity perception task (Experiment 1). Caucasian and Chinese participants judged dissimilarity of own-race and other-race faces with various configural distortions relative to their unaltered versions. As predicted by the composite account, face spaces derived from the dissimilarity ratings for own-race and other-race faces were comparable. Consistent with the premise that expertise affects configural coding, Caucasian participants exhibited greater sensitivity to configural changes of own-race than other-race faces. 
 The effects of expertise on configural encoding were further examined in a bizarreness perception paradigm (Experiments 2-4). Caucasian participants rated bizarreness of unaltered and distorted faces rotated from upright to inverted in 15&#65533; increments. The distortions involved either simple component alterations (i.e., whitened pupils and blackened teeth), global configural changes (i.e., inverted eyes and mouth), or more local configural transformations (e.g., moving the eyes closer together and upwards, and shifting the mouth down). Similar bizarreness ratings for all faces with component distortions confirmed that expertise does not affect processing of simple component information. Differences in the perceived bizarreness of own-race and other-race faces in the unaltered and global configural distortion conditions corroborated the hypothesis that expertise influences holistic configural encoding. Variations in the perceived bizarreness of faces with more local configural changes, however, indicated that expertise might also affect local configural coding. 
 The effects of expertise on local configural processing were further examined in a discrimination paradigm (Experiments 5 and 6). Participants made same-different decisions with upright and inverted face pairs comprising either two identical faces (same trials) or unaltered and distorted versions of the same face (different trials). To distinguish between holistic and local processing of configural information, partial faces were created in addition to whole faces. Higher accuracy for own-race than other-race faces at both upright and inverted orientations in both whole and partial face conditions substantiated the argument that expertise modulates local configural encoding. 
 Altogether, the present investigation offers direct evidence for the composite account of the effects of race. As ventured by the composite account, the own-race face bias in face perception was shown to be due to variations in configural processing. In addition, the reported experiments support the argument that configural information can be encoded both locally and holistically.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">face perception</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070412.162508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation and characterisation of nanoparticles from biocompatible microemulsions</field><field name="creator">Krauel, Karen</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to prepare poly (ethylcyanoacrylate) (PECA) nanoparticles on the basis of different types of microemulsions, to investigate the entrapment within and release of a bioactive from these particles and to establish a set of delivery systems with varying entrapment and release characteristics, thereby giving the formulator the opportunity of a more tailor-made approach in the development of a delivery system. Furthermore the scale up of particle preparation and the possible enhancement of the immunogenic properties of PECA particles by incorporation of the adjuvant Quil A was investigated. 
 Methods: Four phase triangles were established and microemulsion samples, used as a template to prepare nanoparticles, were characterised by viscosity and conductivity measurements, polarising light microscopy, freeze fracture transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo field emission electron microscopy (cryo FESEM) and self-diffusion NMR to determine their microemulsion type (droplet, bicontinuous, solution type). PECA nanoparticles were prepared from different types of microemulsions by interfacial polymerisation. Particle size, polydispersity index (PI) and [zeta]-potential were measured by photon correlation spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility respectively. Normal scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo FESEM were used to visualise particles. Fluorescently labelled ovalbumin (FITC-OVA) was used as a model protein/antigen and entrapment within and release from nanoparticles was investigated. To scale up nanoparticle preparation an instrumental set-up with reactor, peristaltic pump and stirrer was used. A 2&#8311; fractional factorial study was designed to observe possible factors or their interactions that could influence particle formation under scale up conditions. For an immunological study freeze dried formulations of PECA nanoparticles, having FITC-OVA and Quil A entrapped, were prepared, and activation and uptake of formulations by murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in vitro were monitored. 
 Results: Results obtained from the measurements described above, for formulations from the four different phase triangles, indicated that microemulsions of w/o droplet, bicontinuous or solution type could be formed. It was possible to prepare PECA nanoparticles from all of the different types of microemulsions. Particles had an average size of 265 nm &#65533; 24, with an average PI of 0.18 &#65533; 0.05 and an average negative [zeta]-potential of -17 mV &#65533; -5. Particle size, PI and [zeta]-potential were not influenced by the type of microemulsion that was used as a polymerisation template. Entrapment and release were however influenced by the type of microemulsion and although entrapment of FITC-OVA was generally high for PECA particles, it was highest for particles prepared from a droplet type microemulsion. Entrapment could also be increased by increasing amounts of monomer. The rate of release was dependent on the amount of monomer used for polymerisation and the type of microemulsion used for particle preparation, with nanoparticles prepared from a w/o droplet type microemulsion showing the slowest release. Furthermore it was shown that particle preparation could be scaled-up with the instrumental set-up used in this study, but conditions need to be refined as the average particle size and polydispersity index were considerably larger (441 nm &#65533; 101, 0.68 &#65533; 0.14) when compared to particles prepared by the beaker-pipette method (see above). The adjuvant Quil A could efficiently be entrapped into PECA nanoparticles together with FITC-OVA. Incubation of DCs and T cells with the various formulations did, however, not result in increased uptake or activation. 
 Conclusions: PECA nanoparticles with high entrapment efficiency of antigen and adjuvant can be prepared from different types of microemulsions. Particles show different rates of entrapment and release depending on the type of microemulsion used as a polymerisation template, possibly because two different types of nanoparticles form. Nanocapsules are believed to form on the basis of droplet type microemulsions and nanospheres form on the basis of bicontinuous and solution type microemulsions. Freeze dried formulations of PECA nanoparticles, containing Quil A and FITC-OVA, were not able to induce an immune response, which might be due to charge repulsion effects between the negatively charged PECA nanoparticles and the negatively charged surface of dendritic cells. Moreover, no adjuvant effect of Quil A was apparent, perhaps caused by total encapsulation of the compound into the particle matrix with no active groups extending out displaying adjuvanticity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">biomedical materials</field><field name="subject">biocompatibility</field><field name="subject">emulsions (pharmacy)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.130711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic approaches to the angucycline antibiotics</field><field name="creator">Osman, Hasnah</field><field name="description">The stereoselective synthesis of urdamycinone B (17) was achieved in a 21% overall yield from C-glycosyl-naphthoquinone 197. The key reaction was the Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of 197 and siloxydiene (&#65533;)-117 promoted by a chiral Lewis acid derived from (S)-3,3&#65533;-diphenyl-1,1&#65533;-binaphthalene-2,2&#65533;-diol (291), BH&#8323;.THF and acetic acid. An effective kinetic resolution of (&#65533;)-117 occurred. Four cycloadducts 199a-d were formed in a ratio between 84:8:2:6 and 70:9:2:19. Aromatisation of the mixture by treatment with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) gave 200a and 200b in 4:1 ratio. A sequence of reactions involving deacetylation, conversion of a phenyldimethylsilyl group into a hydroxyl group and photooxidation gave a 4:1 mixture of urdamycinone B (17) and its C-3 epimer (154). Separation of these products was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 
 The C-glycosyl donor, 1,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose (204), was synthesised from readily accessible tri-O-acetyl-D-glucal (237) using two approaches. The first involved a sequence of deacetylation, tosylation, lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH&#8324;) reduction and acetylation to give di-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-D-glucal (242). The triphenylphosphine hydrogen bromide (TPPHBr) catalysed addition of acetic acid to 242 gave 204 in overall yields ranging from 0 to 32%. The step involving the reduction of the tosylate intermediate was the cause of the variable yields. 
 The alternative synthesis started with the TPPHBr catalysed addition of benzyl alcohol to 237. Subsequent deacetylation, tosylation and reduction with LiAlH&#8324; gave benzyl 2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranoside (250). Acetylation and hydrogenolytic debenzylation gave 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose (247). Acetylation gave 204 in 40% overall yield. 
 A third approach to 204 involved selective tosylation of methyl &#945;-D-mannopyranoside (258) and subsequent treatment with 2,2-dimethoxypropane under acidic conditions to give acetonide 255. LiAlH&#8324; reduction of the tosylate gave methyl 6-deoxy-2,3-O-isopropylidene-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (256). Acidic hydrolysis of 256 and subsequent acetylation afforded 1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (260). Treatment of 260 with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid and subsequent reductive elimination with a zinc-copper couple gave 242. The addition of acetic acid catalysed by TPPHBr afforded 204 in 18% overall yield. 
 The final synthesis of 204 started with thiophenyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (269). A sequence of deacetylation, tosylation and LiAlH&#8324; reduction gave thiophenyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-6-deoxy-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (274). The structure of 274 was confirmed from a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. Hydrolysis of the isopropylidene group of 274 and subsequent acetylation afforded thiophenyl 6-deoxy-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-&#945;-D-mannopyrannoside (282). Treatment of 282 with iodine monobromide and subsequent reductive elimination with zinc-copper couple gave 242. The TPPHBr catalysed addition of acetic acid to 242 afforded 204 in 19% overall yield. 
 Differentially protected C-glycosyl donor, 1,3-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-mannopyranose (265), was synthesised from 274. The benzylation of 274 gave thiophenyl 6-deoxy-2,3-O-isopropylidene-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (276). Acidic hydrolysis followed by acetylation afforded thiophenyl 6-deoxy-1,2-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (278) which, upon bromination by iodine monobromide, gave thiophenyl 6-deoxy-1,2-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl bromide (279). The reductive elimination of 279 with zinc-copper couple gave 3-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-6-deoxy-D-glycal (264). The TPPHBr catalysed addition of acetic acid to 264 afforded 1,3-di-O-acetyl-4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-D-mannopyranose (265) in 16% overall yield from 274. The instabillity of bromide 279 affected the yield of 265. 
 A C-glycosylation study of 2-naphthol 227 and 1,4-dimethoxy-5-hydroxynaphthalene (205) with 2-deoxy-glycosyl acetates was undertaken. Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF&#8323;.Et&#8322;O) and scandium triflate [Sc(OTf)&#8323;] proved effective promoters. For example, the glycosylation reaction of donor 265 and 227, promoted by 0.5 equivalents of Sc(OTf)&#8323;, afforded C-glycoside 2-hydroxy-1-[3&#65533;-O-acetyl-4&#65533;-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-&#946;-D-manno-hexopyranosyl]-naphthalene (289) in 85% yield.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antibiotics</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">glycosides</field><field name="subject">Diels-Alder reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070426.160307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent multiwavelength sources for tropospheric aerosol lidar</field><field name="creator">Rawle, Christopher B.</field><field name="description">The monitoring and study of the earth&#65533;s atmosphere is becoming an increasingly important task given the current uncertainties in climate prediction. Areas where lidar has been used to further understanding of the atmosphere include monitoring of greenhouse gases, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, photochemical smog and aerosol photochemistry. However, the potentially severe long term effects of anthropogenic aerosols on earth&#65533;s biosphere are poorly understood. This project seeks to apply state of the art laser technology to develop an innovative multiwavelength lidar system capable of providing new information and new insights into the field of tropospheric aerosol lidar. 
 Several novel tunable laser and laser-like sources have been investigated and developed for the purpose of tropospheric aerosol lidar at The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), Central Otago. Multiwavelength operation in the visible and near infrared portion of the spectrum has been emphasised with the sources developed collectively spanning the wavelength interval of 400-1369 nm. The laser sources investigated were the LiF:F2+ colour centre, Titanium Sapphire (Ti:sapphire) and barium nitrate Raman lasers. In addition to the laser sources, the &#946;-barium borate optical parametric oscillator (BBO OPO) was characterised. For each of the sources, lidar relevant aspects were studied. The results recorded include conversion efficiency with respect to the pump source, linewidth and tuning characteristics, beam quality, temporal behaviour, and device reliability and ruggedness. 
 It was found that the LiF:F2+ laser offered significantly lower threshold, broader tuning and higher output pulse energies than the Ti:sapphire laser in the 900-1000 nm region. The high optical gain of the LiF:F2+ medium facilitated cavity optical alignment and operation of the system. The high gain also resulted in temporal behaviour well suited to the existing Niwa lidar detection scheme. When using a 5 ns pump source, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) was found to limit the laser tuning range and efficiency. 
 The barium nitrate Raman laser was based on a simple linear cavity arrangement which resulted in a compact and robust device with no moving components. The stimulated Raman scattering process offers relatively narrow linewidth laser operation at the first and second Stokes wavelengths of 1197 nm and 1369 nm respectively. This laser offered efficient operation once the high operation threshold was reached. Second harmonic generation was used to extend the number of potential lidar transmitter lines produced. The barium nitrate Raman laser possessed high beam divergence and a maximum of three discrete transmitter wavelengths. 
 The BBO OPO used a type I collinear signal resonant configuration. A plane-plane cavity configuration with pump reflection was found to provide simplicity of design, low threshold, highly efficient operation and output pointing stability. The BBO OPO signal wavelength could be tuned over the wavelength interval of 400-700 nm. The disadvantage of the plane cavity was high output beam divergence. However, this was successfully brought within the required limits through the use of a 40 mm long cavity in conjunction with an expanding and collimating telescope. 
 As a result of the study, a Tunable lidar Transmitter (TLT) system based on the BBO OPO was designed and constructed at the Physics Department. The TLT was computer-controlled using custom written software and constructed in a self contained modular manner with all required mechanical, electrical and optical components. A user manual was also written to accompany the TLT. The TLT was installed at Niwa and was successfully used to gather preliminary multiwavelength lidar data. 
 The TLT BBO OPO threshold occurred for a pump energy of 5.2 mJ (10.6 MW/cm2) and had a maximum slope efficiency of 53%. Signal efficiency varied from 24-41-35% over the intervals of 410-500-600 nm. A maximum signal energy of 21 mJ was obtained for a signal wavelength of 492 nm when using the maximum available pump energy of 42 mJ. OPO signal linewidth varied from 0.1-1-8 nm over the signal wavelength intervals of 400-600-700 nm. The associated OPO finesse varied between 370 and 100 as the signal wavelength was tuned over the wavelength interval of 400-600 nm. The temporal behaviour of the BBO OPO was a slowly varying function of pump energy and closely followed the temporal behaviour of the pump laser, making it well suited to the existing Italian lidar detection and timing scheme.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical radar</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">tropospheric aerosols</field><field name="subject">optical properties</field><field name="subject">wavelength division multiplexing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.114533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectroscopic investigation and quantitation of polymorphism and crystallinity of pharmaceutical compounds</field><field name="creator">Strachan, Clare</field><field name="description">Spectroscopy is increasingly used to investigate and monitor the solid state forms of pharmaceutical materials and products.

 In this thesis, the spectroscopic techniques Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, terahertz pulsed spectroscopy and second harmonic generation were used to characterise and quantify polymorphism and crystallinity of pharmaceutical compounds. Where possible, the multivariate analysis technique partial least squares was used for quantitative analysis. Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy detects polarisability changes mainly associated with molecular vibrations. Terahertz pulsed spectroscopy is a new spectroscopic technique that operates between the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and detects dipole moment changes mainly associated with crystalline phonon vibrations in the solid state. Second harmonic generation is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that depends on the dipole moment in crystals and crystal symmetry. 
 Several materials capable of existing in different solid state forms were used. FT-Raman spectroscopy was able to differentiate carbamazepine forms I and III, enalapril maleate forms I and II and &#947;-crystalline and amorphous indomethacin. Combined with partial least squares the technique could quantify binary mixtures of CBZ forms I and III with a limit of detection as low as 1%, and mixtures of enalapril maleate with a limit of detection of as low as 2%. 
 Terahertz pulsed spectroscopy obtained very different spectra for carbamazepine forms I and III, enalapril maleate forms I and II, &#947;-crystalline and amorphous indomethacin, crystalline and supercooled thermotropic liquid crystalline fenoprofen calcium, three forms of lactose, and five forms of sulphathiazole. At present the modes in the spectra cannot be attributed to specific phonon modes. Quantitation of binary mixtures of different forms of a compound using partial least squares analysis usually resulted in a limit of detection of about 1%. 
 Second harmonic generation was used to quantify binary mixtures of different forms of enalapril maleate and lactose, as well as binary mixtures of enalapril maleate form II and polyvinylpyrrolidone. A quantitative relationship was present for each of the mixtures, however the limits of detection were usually above 10%. The high value is probably due to the machine being a prototype and univariate analysis associated with a single output variable. Future improvements to the apparatus and measurement parameters are likely to reduce the limits of detection. Ranitidine hydrochloride polymorphs could also be differentiated using second harmonic generation, however &#947;-crystalline and amorphous indomethacin and forms I and III of carbamazepine could not. 
 The methods used in this thesis were successfully used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of polymorphism and crystallinity of pharmaceutical compounds. TPS and SHG are useful additions to the range of experimental techniques that can be used to investigate and monitor properties of pharmaceutical solids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">spectra</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">polymorphism (crystallography)</field><field name="subject">crystallization</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.141108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making news at Pakaitore: a multi-sighted ethnography</field><field name="creator">Tait, Sue</field><field name="description">As a public medium and a vehicle of "culture", which frames and comprehends social priorities, relations and identities, news has received scant anthropological attention (Spitulnik 1993).
	Whanganui Iwi&#65533;s occupation of Moutoa Gardens in 1995 was made available to a public as "news". My project reveals a range of exclusions around these mediations, which conjure wider issues regarding the production of representations within (post) colonial contexts. As a contribution to anthropology, my ethnography responds to the limitations of traditional ethnographic praxis, providing a productive response to criticisms of the discipline and revealing the public value of ethnographic sensibilities.
	Whanganui Iwi believed the Gardens to be the historical site of Pakaitore pa. The area was reclaimed as a marae, shelters were built, the perimeter fenced, and Iwi lived on site for 80 days. The initiative constituted an expression of Iwi&#65533;s experiences of exteriority within Wanganui and their frustration with the delay of the Crown&#65533;s response to their claims alleging breaches of Treaty of Waitangi. Iwi temporarily inverted their relationship to the Pakeha community by establishing a literal boundary to the marae, which rendered those who were not supportive of Iwi aspirations "outsiders". While access to the marae was controlled, and restrictions were placed on news workers, the only group banned from the marae were the employees of the city&#65533;s newspaper, the Wanganui Chronicle.
	My project details the production of news about Pakaitore, and the attempts of Iwi to control their representation; specifying the role of "location" (both spatial and ideological) in the production of written and photographic accounts (Haraway 1991). I examine how the structures of news production are deployed and contested by news workers, and the manner in which news texts may or may not be "inhabited" by their subjects and public.
	I compare the journalistic practices of Chronicle workers, prior to and following their ban, with those of out of town newsworkers from press and television. The mechanisms, codes, and values of what makes "good" news structure particular locations for news workers, and this largely precluded conveying the intention and experience of nga Iwi at Pakaitore. This extended to the reports gathered by the reporter for TVNZ (the state owned broadcaster), who, as Iwi wha&#772;nau, was allowed unfettered access to the marae.
	Being "the news" interfered with agendas inside the marae. From this location, Pakaitore was about building relationships between hapu and strengthening a sense of community. Hui addressed the status of Iwi within Wanganui, and rangatahi and visitors were educated in tribal history and tikanga. These priorities contest the "outside" perspective that Pakaitore was simply an attempt to antagonise Pakeha authorities.
	Throughout the course of my fieldwork visual aspects of media representations of Pakaitore were cited by a range of my informants as conveying particular authority. In some contexts this was by way of revealing the "truth" about the threat of protest to social cohesion, while in others it provided evidence for the media&#65533;s inability to represent the initiative in a manner that was sympathetic to, or representative of, Iwi whanau. I argue that the privileging of the disembodied visual reproduces myths of "otherness", covering over experiences of embodied "difference" and the history which renders activism intelligible.

It was introduced and developed by Maori nurses initially, as they recognised the effect culture had on health and understood safety as a common nursing concept. The concept of cultural safety has developed into a disipline which is taught as part of all nursing and midwifery curricula in Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand. As cultural safety has developed the concept of culture has been extended to include people who differ from the nurse by reason of: age, migrant status, sexual preference, socioeconomic status, religious persuasion, gender, ethnicity, and in Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu/New Zealand, the Treaty of Waitangi status of the nurse and recipient/s of her/his care.
	Nationally and internationally, health experience and health outcomes are poorer for people of minority group status than for people who are part of the dominant group. Public-health research is therefore generally conducted on, or with, people with minority group status. Public-health researchers, by education, are members of the dominant culture and may be unaware that their own and their clients; responses may relate to one/other or both cultures being diminished do not always ensure the safety of their own culture or the culture being researched.
	This study&#65533;s objective was to develop a flexible, culturally safe public health research framework for researches to use when researching people who are culturally different from themselves. The study will argue that the use of such a framework will contribute significantly to improved health outcomes for people with minority status and will assist the movement towards emancipatory social change.
	The methods undertaken included: gaining permission from Irihapeti Ramsden, the architect of cultural safety to undertake the research, conducting a literature review, consideration of primary sources and their key concepts, consulting widely with people in the field of public health and cultural safety, self reflecting on the writers own personal and professional experience and finally designing the culturally safe public health research framework.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">medical care</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">tikanga</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070524.120343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicine amongst the Maoris in ancient and modern times.</field><field name="creator">Buck, Peter Henry (Te Rangi Hiroa)</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 My excuse for attempting this thesis is firstly, that I am a graduate in medicine of the University of New Zealand and secondly, that my mother was a Maori.
	It seems to me that with a young university such as that of New Zealand, without the facilities for research work provided by older and richer homes of learning, the scope for original work, which it is the duty of every University to encourage and foster, is somewhat limited. In the philology, history and ethnology of the Polynesian Race, however, is provided a wide field for research work which it is the bounden duty of this University to explore and lead the way. As an obligation to my &#65533;alma mater&#65533; I take up the subject nearest to my family - medicine amongst the Maoris, in ancient and modern times.
	As another reason, I have the honour through my mother of belonging to the Maori race. As a result of four years work amongst them as an officer of Health, I am much struck by the different view-point with which the two races, European and Maori, approach the subject of disease. As a member of the Race I am perhaps enabled to understand my mother&#65533;s people more intimately than the more progressive but some what forgetful Anglo-Saxon. My experience of Maori ideas and customs dates from beyond the time of graduation in medicine. In childhood&#65533;s days, I experienced the bitter taste of the decoction prepared from phorium tenex and I heard around me the whispered diagnosis of &#65533;makutu&#65533; and &#65533;mate Maori&#65533;. Constantly throughout youth and early manhood, I have seen the European doctor wax impatient with what he terms prejudices or superstitions which retard or prevent the recovery of Maori patients. I have understood and sympathised with him. At the same time, with the priveledge of the half-breed inheriting the blood and ideas of both races I have been able to detach myself from European thought and look at the question of disease from my Maori countryman&#65533;s viewpoint. I understood the burden of the neolithic man&#65533;s fears and I symathise with him more deeply still. There are deep holes in the Urenui river which flows through our tribal territory wherein, so my Maori mother taught me, dwelt &#65533;taniwhas&#65533; or &#65533;dragons of slime&#65533; who destroyed the transgressor of the multitude of Maori laws and observances. Years of College and University education, combined with the unbelief inherited from a European father, have not been able to suppress the involuntary shudder and contraction of the erector pilae which the suggestion of bathing in those dark holes gives rise to. We inherit our fears in our blood, we imbibe them at our mother&#65533;s breast. The schools and teaching of a father appeal to us as we grow older. We subject customs and faiths to the light of comparative criticism and we ridicule the ideas of more primitive races as absurd. But in times of stress, despondency and lowered vitality, there is a tendency to revert to the mother&#65533;s fears which slumber within beneath the veneer of civilisation. How much more so in the case of the full Maori who has not had the advantage of even primary education! Clodd says, "In structure and inherited tendencies each of us is recent". The Maori has not been civilised for a century yet. As a duty to my kin, I have attempted to put on record their view of disease, in the hope that though anthropologist&#65533;s and others have done so much in collecting the ideas and customs of races on a lower culture stage, this thesis may serve as a small contribution to ethnology.</field><field name="date">1910</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">medicine</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">hauora</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.130005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian statistical models for predicting software effort using small datasets</field><field name="creator">Van Koten, Chikako</field><field name="description">The need of today&#65533;s society for new technology has resulted in the development of a growing number of software systems. Developing a software system is a complex endeavour that requires a large amount of time. This amount of time is referred to as software development effort. Software development effort is the sum of hours spent by all individuals involved. Therefore, it is not equal to the duration of the development. 
 Accurate prediction of the effort at an early stage of development is an important factor in the successful completion of a software system, since it enables the developing organization to allocate and manage their resource effectively. However, for many software systems, accurately predicting the effort is a challenge. Hence, a model that assists in the prediction is of active interest to software practitioners and researchers alike. 
 Software development effort varies depending on many variables that are specific to the system, its developmental environment and the organization in which it is being developed. An accurate model for predicting software development effort can often be built specifically for the target system and its developmental environment. A local dataset of similar systems to the target system, developed in a similar environment, is then used to calibrate the model. 
 However, such a dataset often consists of fewer than 10 software systems, causing a serious problem in the prediction, since predictive accuracy of existing models deteriorates as the size of the dataset decreases. 
 This research addressed this problem with a new approach using Bayesian statistics. This particular approach was chosen, since the predictive accuracy of a Bayesian statistical model is not so dependent on a large dataset as other models. As the size of the dataset decreases to fewer than 10 software systems, the accuracy deterioration of the model is expected to be less than that of existing models. The Bayesian statistical model can also provide additional information useful for predicting software development effort, because it is also capable of selecting important variables from multiple candidates. In addition, it is parametric and produces an uncertainty estimate. 
 This research developed new Bayesian statistical models for predicting software development effort. Their predictive accuracy was then evaluated in four case studies using different datasets, and compared with other models applicable to the same small dataset. 
 The results have confirmed that the best new models are not only accurate but also consistently more accurate than their regression counterpart, when calibrated with fewer than 10 systems. They can thus replace the regression model when using small datasets. Furthermore, one case study has shown that the best new models are more accurate than a simple model that predicts the effort by calculating the average value of the calibration data. Two case studies has also indicated that the best new models can be more accurate for some software systems than a case-based reasoning model. 
 Since the case studies provided sufficient empirical evidence that the new models are generally more accurate than existing models compared, in the case of small datasets, this research has produced a methodology for predicting software development effort using the new models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="subject">computer</field><field name="subject">software</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">mathematical</field><field name="subject">models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071009.120134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular basis of orthodontic tooth movement : cytokine signaling by PDL cells in tension an in vitro study</field><field name="creator">Pinkerton, Mark Neil</field><field name="description">The pressure-tension hypothesis is the governing dogma of orthodontic tooth movement. This theory proposes that the application of loads to the crown of a tooth during orthodontic mechano-therapy results in differential site-specific reactionary strains in the para-dental tissues. Briefly, following the application of orthodontic load the bone and periodontal ligament (PDL) on one side of the tooth is placed in compression favoring bone resorption, while on the other side of the tooth they are placed in tension favoring osteogenesis The present in vitro model provides a surrogate for the PDL on the tension side of the tooth during orthodontic tooth movement and aims to identify mechanically induced changes in the expression of osteo-regulatory cytokines in human PDL cell cultures in response to tensile mechanical strain. 
 Materials and Methods: PDL explants were obtained from pathology free bicuspids of two human subjects following extraction of the teeth for orthodontic purposes. Following serial passage, cells were plated on Uniflex&#65533; plates and consigned to either the experimental or control groups. Experimental cells were exposed to a cyclic uniaxial tensile mechanical strain for 6,12 or 24 hours using the Flexercell FX 4000 strain unit. Total RNA was extracted using a two-step procedure and samples were analysed using real-time RT-PCR assays for a range of osteo-regulatory cytokines. 
 Results: Human PDL cells expressed mRNA for a range of cytokines of known significance to osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in response to mechanical stimulation. 
 Conclusions: The production of osteo-regulatory cytokines by PDL cells in response to mechanical strain suggests that these cells have the potential to contribute to the osseous modeling of orthodontic tooth movement. The presence of osteogenic signalling drive in response to tensile strain tends to support the basic assertions of the pressure-tension hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teeth</field><field name="subject">movements</field><field name="subject">molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">cytokines</field><field name="subject">mechanism</field><field name="subject">periodontal ligament</field><field name="subject">orthodontics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071207.161056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of intermittent tensile strain on RANKL, OPG, M-CSF and IL-1&#946; expression by periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro</field><field name="creator">Gaffey, Benjamin James</field><field name="description">Mechanical stress has been shown to play a role in bone remodelling during orthodontic tooth movement. Receptor activator of nuclear factor k&#946; - ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and interleukin 1-&#946; (IL-1&#946;) play key roles in the regulation of bone remodelling, but the role of these cytokines in orthodontic tooth movement is poorly understood. 
 Aim: The aim of this experiment was to examine the response of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts in monolayer culture to intermittent tensile stress as regards RANKL, OPG, M-CSF and IL-1&#946; production. 
 Methods: Human PDL fibroblasts were dissected from premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes. Explants were seeded out in 1cm wells and grown to confluence in Dulbecco&#65533;s modification of Eagle&#65533;s medium, containing 10% foetal calf serum and antibiotics, at 37&#65533;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO&#8322;/95% air. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were passaged into sequentially larger flasks. Fibroblasts were passaged 6 times. After reaching confluence in T175 flasks, the cells were detached and plated at a cell density of 10&#8309;/dish in 35mm Bioflex&#65533; Plates coated with type 1 collagen. The cells were placed under a continuous uni-axial strain of 12% for 6s of every 90s by a Flexercell FX 4000C[TM] for 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Cells were then detached and stored in RNAlater. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the mRNA of the cytokines of interest. 
 Results: Tensile force led to the down regulation of mRNA expression for OPG and IL-1&#946; at 12 and 24 hours respectively, while M-CSF was up-regulated at 6 hours. RANKL was not detected at a significant level for quantification. 
 Conclusion: This osteoclastic-type response indicates the complexity of mechanotransduction in an in vitro setting.

Although there have been studies on borders carried out in the past for various purposes, there remains a distinct lack of research into cross-border leisure-oriented mobility, particularly in Southeast Asia. As a result, examining constraints and permeability on leisure-oriented cross-border mobility may well help to overcome the tourist behaviour and cross-border mobility divide in literature, thus the subject of this thesis. The aims of this thesis are to investigate an identifiable sector of the population (i.e. Thai university students) and to analyze the motivations that drive, and constraints that limit their ability to travel to the neighbouring countries of Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar. 
 Using a self-administered closed-questionnaire, data was collected from 750 students in seven universities in three provinces: Assumption, Kasetsart, and Thammasart Universities in Bangkok, Naresuan, and Pibunsongkram Rajabhat Universities, in Phitsanulok, and Mae Fah Luang and Chiang Rai Rajabhat Universities in Chiang Rai. The data was collected from October to December 2005. A response rate of approximately fifty percent was achieved. 
 Analysis of the data showed that Thai university students were motivated by visiting heritage and historical sites to cross borders to Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar; whereas, the driving force for visits to Malaysia was to see new things and places. Interestingly, fear emerged as the constraint which most limited the students from travelling over the border to each of Thailand&#65533;s neighbouring countries. Psychological constraints were reported as having more influence on the respondents&#65533; border crossings than physical constraints. Distance from the borders also influenced cross-border ability. The study showed that cross-border travel behaviour was related to gender and income, but unrelated to the respondents&#65533; age. The research revealed that the respondents felt the easiest way to overcome their constraints to travel was to gain more travel experience and search for more information on their destination of choice. 
 Interviews were gathered from fifteen key persons employed in five different fields of the travel industry and whose work related either directly and indirectly to cross-border mobility. The interviews took place during November 2005 to February 2006 at informants&#65533; workplaces in Bangkok and Chiang Rai. It was revealed that tourism development in border areas is regarded by society as having substantial social and economic benefits to the local people and their communities. It also revealed that borders do not have any direct physical effects toward people&#65533;s movement. 
 It was found that the tenets of people&#65533;s leisure-oriented cross-border mobility were formed by both motivations and constraints; therefore, individuals must find a way to negotiate or overcome constraints before achieving the actual action. The uniqueness of the study was to illustrate the dynamic and simultaneous treatment of the fundamentals contributing to cross border mobility. 
 This thesis has broken new ground in analyzing the theories developed predominantly in Western contexts of travel motivations and leisure constraints in an Asian setting, particularly in the context of Thai studies. It was found that the Thai tourist behaviour especially the university students, who are an important and significant and separate population, are difference from those students in the Western society in that Thai university students more concern in cross-border travelling to gain knowledge than to enjoy nightlife (sex, alcohol, and drugs).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">boundaries</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">travelers</field><field name="subject">college students</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071018.114257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine-scale ecology of alpine patterned ground, Old Man Range, Central Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scott, Matthew B</field><field name="description">This study is an interdisciplinary ecological study addressing the fine-scale relationships between plants, invertebrates and the environment in an alpine ecosystem. Alpine environments are marked by steep environmental gradients and complex habitat mosaics at various spatial scales. Regular forming periglacial patterned ground landforms on the Old Man Range, Central Otago, South Island, New Zealand present an ideal medium for studying plant-invertebrate-environment relationships due to their partitioning of the landscape into discrete units of contrasting environmental conditions, and the existence of some baseline knowledge of the soil, microclimate, vegetation and flora. 
 The study was conducted in three types of patterned ground (hummocks, stripes and solifluction terraces) on the Old Man Range. Each component of the study was sampled at the same spatial scale for comparison. Temperature was recorded in the soil and ground surface from April 2001 to March 2004 in microtopographic subunits (microsites) of each patterned ground landform. Plant species cover was sampled within each microsite; invertebrates were sampled from soil cores taken from the same locations as plant samples in April 2001 and September 2001. The two sampling occasions coincided with autumn before the soil freezes, and winter when maximum freezing was expected. 
 Fine-scale changes in the topographic relief of the patterned ground led to notable differences in the timing and duration of snow. The steepest environmental gradients existed during periods of uneven snow distribution. The soil in exposed or south-facing microsites froze first, beginning in May, and typically froze to more than 40cm depth. Least exposed microsites rarely froze. Within the microtopography, patterns of freezing at specific locations were consistent between years with only minor differences in the timing or depths of freezing; however, notable variation in freezing existed between similar microsites. 
 Within the microtopography, different assemblages of organisms were associated with different microsites. In total, 84 plant and lichen species were recorded, grouping into six community types. Species composition was best explained by growing degree-days, freeze-thaw cycles, time frozen and snow-free days; species diversity and richness increased with increasing environmental stress as indicated by freeze-thaw cycles, time frozen and exposure. 
 In total 20,494 invertebrates, representing four Phyla, 12 Classes, 23 Orders and 295 morpho-taxa were collected from 0.17m&#65533; of soil. Acari, Collembola and Pseudococcidae were the most abundant invertebrates. Over 95% of the invertebrates were found in the plant material and first 10cm depth of soil. Few significant relationships were found between diversity, richness or abundance of invertebrate taxa and the microsites; however, multivariate analyses identified distinct invertebrate assemblages based on abundance. Invertebrate composition was best explained by recent low temperature and moisture, particularly in winter; however, plant composition also explained invertebrate composition, but more so in autumn. 
 This research has shown that organisms in the alpine environment of the Old Man Range are sensitive to fine-scale changes in their environment. These results have implications as to how historical changes to the ecosystem may have had long-lasting influences on the biota, as well as how a currently changing climate may have further impacts on the composition and distribution of organisms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="subject">mountain</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">natural areas</field><field name="subject">mountain plants</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">plant-snow relationships</field><field name="subject">ecological surveys</field><field name="subject">Old Man Range (N.Z.)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080130.093120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of perceived occupational stress, burnout and sense of community among New Zealand nurses</field><field name="creator">Ditzel, Elizabeth Mary</field><field name="description">This research shows that sense of community reduces the effect of job stress on burnout among a sample of 672 New Zealand nurses. Sense of community - a feeling that members matter to one another (and to the group) and a shared faith that members&#65533; needs will be met through their commitment to be together - consists of four elements: membership, integration and fulfilment of needs, influence and shared emotional connection. Results indicate that nurses have a moderate to high level of sense of community. Apart from the influence element, subscale reliabilities for the other three elements were acceptably high on the Nurse Sense of Community Index, an instrument that was developed for use in this study. 
 In relation to occupational stress, the study results indicate that high workload, rather than any difference in the practice requirements of various types of nursing work is the most important factor contributing to nurses&#65533; job stress. Public hospital nurses experience significantly higher levels of perceived job stress than their private sector counterparts because high workloads and problems of recruiting and retaining nurses are more typical of the public sector. Nurses who work full-time experience more job stress than those who work part-time, and those in the 20 to 30 age group experience the highest frequency of perceived job stress. 
 Burnout is a syndrome of high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalisation in the presence of a lack of personal accomplishment. Nurses who work full-time experience significantly higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation than those who work part-time. Accident and emergency nurses have the highest level of burnout and intensive care unit nurses the lowest level of burnout among public hospital nurses. 
 Overall, the majority of nurses experience a low to moderate degree of burnout. Yet, a substantial proposition of the sample population acknowledge experiencing some aspect of burnout, and as has been found by other nursing studies, a nurse&#65533;s age influences burnout levels, with younger nurses experiencing more burnout than older nurses. A clear relationship between an increased frequency of perceived job stress and burnout was identified. Results suggest that nurses with a high level of sense of community have lower frequencies of perceived job stress, experience lower burnout than those with low and moderate levels of sense of community. Findings demonstrate that burnout remains a serious issue for nurses the nursing profession and, as the demands on professional workers increase, the health care sector.

In the light of these proposals and taking into account more recent narrative theory, this study of early Moses scenes in art takes up the suggestion that a large range of visual narrative scenes, closely following a given text and with a tendency for these scenes to be arranged in narrative sequence, might indicate the presence of a lost illustrated manuscript which artists are using as their model. 
 Stories about Moses originate from within Judaism, and are mentioned also in Christian texts for the first three centuries AD, when Moses is regarded as the forerunner of Christ. While earlier Jewish art largely conformed to the proscription against figural art, narrative figure scenes illustrating Old Testament stories are known from the late second century AD. In the synagogue at Dura Europos (AD c.250), the range of biblical imagery includes five or six scenes illustrating stories from Exodus and Numbers, although Weitzmann&#65533;s criteria are only partially fulfilled. 
 During the third century AD, when the earliest Christian art is found, Christians use Old Testament imagery as well, including a cycle of scenes illustrating the story of Jonah. The decoration in the baptistery in the Christian house at Dura, like that in the synagogue there, shows some interest in visual narrative, although in this case no Moses scenes are involved. At this time there is only one Moses story certainly illustrated in Christian art, The miracle of the spring (based on Exodus 17), which occurs in funerary art in Rome. The iconography for this scene is used "emblematically" to promote ideas rather than stories about Moses. If at this time Christian artists know of a narrative cycle involving Moses, they show very little interest in reflecting this.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moses (Biblical leader)</field><field name="subject">Jewish art</field><field name="subject">early Christian art</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080318.163116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hospitality management perspectives on casino tourism in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Jitpraphai, Supatcharajit</field><field name="description">Apparently, gambling seems to be valued as a leisure activity and a form of entertainment in many parts of the world. Public attitudes toward gambling have shifted from viewing it as a vice to treating it as an opportunity to exploit (Eadington 1997, 2000). Relaxation of constraints on existing commercial gaming activities and legislative change in authorising gambling has occurred extensively. The proliferation of casinos makes people perceive gambling as a legitimate activity and as an economic hope. According to Pizam and Pokela (1985), casino gambling however is a controversial tourism development strategy. Eadington (1986) also points out that legalised gambling causes economic and social changes in communities and changes their image. Thus, both the character and reputation of the community may be altered as a result of initiating casinos as a tourist attraction. 
 The legalisation of gambling has been a subject of considerable debates in Thailand for a decade and it has been brought into the cabinet&#65533;s meeting from time to time. Some politicians and academic scholars suggest that casinos should be introduced as a tourism development strategy to combat the country&#65533;s economic and financial crisis. Many people are attached to strong belief that gambling is a sinful activity. It is inherently immoral and contrary to accepted family and social values. It is a voluntary regressive tax in which its effects fall most heavily on lower-income groups. It is morally wrong, and can cause an addiction that is often linked to personal and family tragedies. It also attracts criminal activities and political corruption (Piriyarangsan et al. 2003; Cornwel-Smith 2005). As social acceptance of casino gambling has globally increased, this research aims to gauge hospitality management perspectives on gambling and casino tourism. The focus of the paper is to investigate hospitality executives&#65533; attitudes towards relationship between Thai tourism and casino gambling; to explore their views on casino legalisation and regulation; as well as to examine their opinions about casino impacts, operation and management if casinos are legalised in Thailand. 
 Mail questionnaires were carried out during September 2003 - February 2004, resulting in 212 returns of respondents. Then, 18 semi-structured interviews with hotel and tour executives, politicians, policemen, government officials, directors of social service organisations and religious leaders were undertaken in May - July 2005 to acquire more insights into the issues. A combination of quantitative and qualitative data indicates that Thai people have mixed feelings about casino tourism. Although quantitative findings show hospitality group welcome the idea, but they do not want it in their own backyard. Qualitative results are more in opposition. Majority of interviewees hold the differing views. The study concludes that casinos gambling may function simply as a value added or an enhancement to a destination in Thailand, not a main tourism attraction. It is strongly suggested that casino gambling and Thai tourism industry should not be connected. Instead, &#65533;Thai&#65533; hospitality and cultures should be promoted as a unique tourism product of Thailand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">casinos</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080523.122348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical aggression among high school students in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Louise</field><field name="description">Recent New Zealand (NZ) research found rates of physical fighting and weapon carrying among high school students in Dunedin were equal to that of rates for the United States (US). The NZ Government has identified violence as a priority health issue. However, NZ is lacking information on the prevalence of the problem, and the identification of factors which may provide clues for prevention. The current understanding of the social context in which physical aggression takes place, has focused on risk factors that are present in the adolescents&#65533; ecological frame. Emerging protective factors are increasingly being recognised as major determinants that can moderate the adverse effects of risk factors. However, little research into protective factors has been conducted in NZ. 
 The aim of this thesis was to investigate physical aggression among adolescents in NZ. This was explored through four in-depth studies: i) a national survey of secondary school principals and counsellors ii) focus groups with students in Otago; iii) an online survey with students in Otago and iv) a survey with teachers in Otago. 
 The national survey of secondary school principals and counsellors points to a degree of concern about physical violence in NZ. One in ten reported fights occurred frequently, and over a quarter of principals and over one third of counsellors reported that at least one student at their school had been caught carrying a weapon. 
 Focus groups with Otago adolescents indicated that fights often began as verbal disagreements escalating to physical fights, that a fight should be defined as serious as opposed to a play fight; and differences were also found between fighting at school and outside of school. Participants suggested that items may be reported as weapons, even though they are not being carried for such purposes. Previous estimates of aggressive behaviours may have been unjustifiably high and possibly hid signifcant differences in the nature of the aggression being reported. 
 A quantitative cross-sectional online survey was undertaken with Otago secondary school students, and confirmed that physical aggression among NZ adolescents is a significant problem. Mutivariate analyses identified the school as an important factor in the social system of adolescents; in particular feeling safe, not feeling alienated and being treated fairly. The results highlighted the need to concentrate on strategies that improve students&#65533; positive engagement with school as a means to reduce physical aggression. 
 The final study of Otago secondary school teachers showed that while teachers did not consider physical aggression as a major problem in their schools, they did report frequent occurrences of physical fighting. Respondents also reported some teachers experienced significant physical aggression from students. 
 Physical aggression among NZ adolescents is a significant public health problem that needs addressing. This behaviour impacts directly on the education offered to students, the safety of the environment in which learning takes place, and the stress of the work place for teachers. This thesis has identified school engagement as the most promising protective factors for young people against involvement in physical aggression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">aggressiveness in adolescence</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080710.115418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adding to nature : can artificial retreats be used to monitor and restore lizard populations?</field><field name="creator">Lettink, Marieke</field><field name="description">Artificial retreats are increasingly used to sample animal populations and in attempts to boost animal numbers in degraded habitats. Here, I test potential applications of artificial retreats for lizards inhabiting a coastal environment of high conservation value (Kaitorete Spit, New Zealand). I first conducted a pitfall-trapping survey examining the distribution and relative abundance of lizards in duneland, farmland and shrubland habitats, and tested the influence of trap placement on capture rates. Capture rates of the diurnal skinks Oligosoma maccanni (McCann&#65533;s skink) and O. nigriplantare polychroma (common skink) were highest in duneland and farmland, respectively, and were most sensitive to the distance separating traps from the nearest cover (the greater the distance, the lower the capture rate). Captures of O. lineoocellatum (spotted skink) and Hoplodactylus maculatus (common gecko) were rare. 
 Secondly, in separate chapters I test the utility of artificial retreats for monitoring: 1) a preference trial examining relative use of three types of artificial retreats by skinks (O. maccanni and O. n. polychroma) and geckos (H. maculatus); 2) a comparison of the effectiveness of artificial retreats relative to pitfall traps for detecting cryptic and primarily nocturnal geckos (H. maculatus) following translocation; and 3) capture-recapture estimation of population parameters (survival and abundance) of H. maculatus. I found that: 1) geckos strongly preferred retreats made of Onduline over corrugated iron and concrete tiles, whereas skinks exhibited no apparent preferences; 2) artificial retreats were more effective than pitfall traps for detecting geckos following translocation; and 3) monthly survival and recapture probabilities of geckos varied with age-class and over time. Estimated survival was unexpectedly low, possibly due to excessive trap spacing. I developed a new capture-recapture model specifically for population size estimation with data from artificial retreats, which gave estimates that were up to 50% greater than those predicted by conventional capture-recapture models. I caution that permanent placement of artificial retreats in long-term studies may be inappropriate for estimation of population parameters due to potential habitat-enhancement effects and/or altered predation risk. 
 Thirdly, I conducted a capture-recapture field experiment, using a replicated Before-After-Control-impact (BACI) design, to test the relative effects of habitat manipulation (artificial retreat addition) and partial predator removal (by fencing) on annual survival of duneland skink (O. maccanni) populations. Survival increased at sites with predator exclosures, but not at control sites or following the addition of artificial retreats, either alone or in combination with a predator exclosure. The magnitude of the increase in survival for the exclosure-only treatment was small, but sufficient to change the trajectory of an apparently stable population into an increasing one, suggesting that the population is limited by predators. Predator control, but not the addition of artificial retreats, is predicted to benefit O. maccanni. 
 To conclude, the Onduline design developed here appears to be particularly useful for sampling cryptic, terrestrial geckos; however, artificial retreats must be used appropriately to avoid bias arising from habitat-enhancing effects and/or altered predation risk. The restoration value of artificial retreats requires further testing on other species and in areas where natural retreat sites are limited.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">geckos</field><field name="subject">habitations</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">reptile populations</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Kaitorete Spit</field><field name="subject">McCann's skink</field><field name="subject">Hoplodactylus maculatus</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma</field><field name="subject">Oligosoma lineoocellatum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080715.091040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a novel inhibitor of apoptosis expressed by Orf virus</field><field name="creator">Westphal, Dana</field><field name="description">Apoptosis plays important roles in host defences against virus infection. It is therefore not surprising that viruses have developed a vast array of modulators that block this process at different stages within the apoptotic pathways. Intrestingly, Orf virus (ORFV), a member of the Parapoxvirus genus, did not reveal any of the known poxviral inhibitors of apoptosis, but was found to express a unique anti-apoptotic protein, ORFV125. The aim of this PhD project was to determine the subcellular localisation of this protein and to further characterise its anti-apoptotic activity. This included exploring its ability to inhibit early, intermediate and late events of apoptosis and identifying the mechanism by which this viral protein functions to prevent cell death. 
 Experiments revealed that ORFV125 was localised to the mitochondria through a C-terminal mitochondrial-targeting motif, and this specific location was necessary for the protein&#65533;s anti-apoptotic function. Furthermore, the viral protein inhibited UV-induced apoptotic events at and downstream of the mitochondria such as cytochrome c release, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. However, it was not able to prevent UV-induced activation of the c-Jun-NH&#8322; kinase (JNK), an event occurring upstream of the mitochondria, consistent with its localisation to this organelle. The ability to prevent apoptosis was comparable with that of the cellular anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, which belongs to a family of mitochondrial regulators of apoptosis. 
 Although standard BLAST analysis failed to detect homology to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, a manual alignment of the primary sequence of ORFV125 with these proteins revealed characteristic residues of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains within ORFV125. These motifs are conserved within the Bcl-2 proteins and important for their structure and function. In addition, mutating amino acids within the ORFV125 BH domains led to a loss of the anti-apoptotic function of the mutated proteins, indicating the functional importance of these residues for the viral protein. These observations suggest that ORFV125 might be classified as a viral Bcl-2-like protein. 
 To provide evidence for this hypothesis, it was investigated if ORFV125 acts in a Bcl-2-like manner to inhibit apoptosis. The viral protein was able to entirely block the activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax, although it did not directly bind to these proteins. Instead, ORFV125 interacted with a subset of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, which can trigger the activation of Bax and Bak. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that ORFV125 could inhibit apoptosis induced by BH3-only proteins to which the viral protein could bind. On the other hand, ORFV125 was not able to prevent the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins that it failed to interact with. This shows that ORFV125&#65533;s mechanism of action is to inhibit the activity of BH3-only proteins by binding and neutralising their function. 
 Overall, these results provided evidence that ORFV125 is potent anti-apoptotic protein that can prevent UV-induced cell death without the participation of other ORFV proteins. Furthermore, the viral protein shared primary sequence and secondary structure similarities to Bcl-2 family members and acted in a Bcl-2-like manner to inhibit apoptosis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Orf virus</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080922.162136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive and emotional effects of vestibular damage in rats and their medial temporal lobe substrates</field><field name="creator">Goddard, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment are increasingly being described in patients with vestibular pathology. Yet frameworks that describe the link between emotion, memory and the vestibular system have yet to reach maturity, partly because studies have not yet provided detailed accounts of behavioral changes in experimental animals, or in man. One of the goals of this thesis was to use experimental psychology to define changes in memory and emotional behaviour in rats given bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD, n=18) or sham surgery (Sham, n=17). In an elevated-plus maze task, BVD rats made up to 166% greater open arm entries and spent up to 42% more time in the open arms compared to Sham rats. In an elevated-T maze task, BVD rats failed to develop a normal learned inhibition response to open space. In an open field maze BVD rats consistently showed 50-60% greater movement velocity, spent on average 35% more time in the inner most aversive part of the arena, and failed to show the normal boundary-seeking behaviour (thigmotaxis) typical of untreated or Sham rats. In a social interaction test BVD rats spent up to 34% less time engaged in social contact compared to Sham rats. In a hyponeophagia test, BVD rats&#65533; latency to eat was 70% greater than Sham rats at 3-weeks post-op., however this difference disappeared at 3- and 5-months. These findings suggest that BVD treatment may in some cases disrupt normal behavioral inhibition. Memory performance was also affected. In a T-maze task BVD rats achieved 40-60% correct arm entries, compared to 90-100% for Sham controls. In a foraging task carried out in darkness, BVD rats&#65533; initial homing angle was random, homing paths were ~70% longer, and reference memory errors were ~56% greater compared to Sham rats. To elucidate possible neurochemical substrates for these behavioral changes, western blot assays on monoamine proteins were carried out on tissue from a nai&#776;ve set of rats (BVD n=6; Sham n=6). In BVD rats, serotonin transporter protein expression was 39% lower in CA1 hippocampus and 27% lower in the forebrain region, despite forebrain tryptophan hydroxylase expression being 34% upregulated. Tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the forebrain region was 27% lower in BVD rats. Proteins related to synaptogenesis were also investigated. In the dentate gyrus SNAP-25 was 37% upregulated in BVD rats, while in area CA2/3 of the hippocampus neurofilament-L was 13% upregulated. Forebrain and entorhinal cortex drebrin expression was 28% and 38% downregulated in BVD rats. Neurofilament-L was also 31% downregulated in the forebrain region of BVD rats. To test whether any of these behavioral or biochemical changes may have been attributable to chronic physiological stress, a corticosterone assay was carried out at the conclusion of behavioral testing; however, the no significant between treatment differences were found. In conclusion, vestibular information appears to be needed for the acquisition of spatial and reference memory as well as the normal expression of emotional behaviour. The neurochemical changes described herein point toward possible substrates for these behaviors, however their full significance has yet to be determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vestibular apparatus</field><field name="subject">temporal lobes</field><field name="subject">pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080923.091605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who cares? : the role of attachment assessments in decision-making for children in care</field><field name="creator">Atwool, Nicola</field><field name="description">In this practice-based research the use of attachment assessments to assist with decision-making about the placement of children in State care is explored. In Aotearoa New Zealand care and protection legislation emphasises the importance of working with families. The central decision-making forum is the Family Group Conference where families, their support people and statutory social workers come together to work out a plan for children considered to be in need of care and protection. This research focused on conflicted situations where agreement could not be reached about where children should live. 
 The research was structured around one over-arching objective: the examination of a specific aspect of practice, namely the use of attachment assessments in decision-making, with a view to identifying elements of best practice. Within this were three other objectives: an exploration of the impact of attachment assessments on decision-making processes; an exploration of the experience of participants in this process; and an examination of perceived outcomes for children who have an assessment completed. In order to achieve these objectives the historical and cultural context influencing these decision-making processes was explored; the theoretical framework underpinning the use of attachment assessments was critically examined; recent literature on children&#65533;s experience in foster care was reviewed; the role of assessment in decision-making was explored; and the use of attachment assessments was evaluated from the perspective of social work practitioners. 
 The outcomes of this research indicate that attachment assessments are theoretically sound processes, which provide relevant information that facilitates decision-making in conflicted situations and the achievement of positive outcomes for children. It was, however, found that attachment assessments have an indirect influence by providing a pivotal point in the decision-making process rather than a direct impact. A number of variables influencing outcomes for children were identified and explored: availability of suitable placements; management of contact with birth family; provision of support networks including attention to ongoing cultural connectedness; and support through adolescence. Children&#65533;s absence from participation in decision-making was highlighted. I conclude with an outline of guidelines for best practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child welfare</field><field name="subject">children's rights</field><field name="subject">foster home care</field><field name="subject">kinship care</field><field name="subject">social work with children</field><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081212.143625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use and Giardia in Otago</field><field name="creator">Winkworth, Cynthia Lee</field><field name="description">Agriculture is key to New Zealand&#65533;s economy with land-use conversions in response to market forces occurring regularly. Recently, high-intensity dairy farming has replaced low-density livestock farming, often degrading surrounding waterways. Of particular concern is that dairy cattle can be a source of the parasite Giardia, which in humans is a common cause of gastrointestinal infection. Thus, this thesis evaluated whether dairy farm conversions posed significant consequences for public health. 
 First I examined the prevalence of Giardia in calves in a rapidly intensifying dairying region of New Zealand. A total of 1190 faecal samples were collected from calves one to seven weeks old during two spring calving seasons and screened by direct immunofluorescent microscopy. Giardia cysts were detected in 31% of samples. 
 To evaluate the potential risk that this environmental source of Giardia posed to the human population, molecular genotyping was used to compare forty Giardia strains isolated from calves with thirty isolates from humans collected in the same region and period. Sequencing the &#946;-giardin gene, Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B were identified from both hosts, with genotype comparisons revealing substantial overlap of identical genotypes for both assemblages, implying zoonotic transmission. 
 Environmental agencies routinely promote the planting of streamside edges to decrease nonpoint pollution from dairy farms entering waterways. However, current methods for tracking pathogens across farmland and into waterways via surface runoff are limited and typically have been developed using artificially created landscapes. Furthermore, no studies have investigated how Giardia moves across the landscape in farm surface runoff. I developed a field-based tracking method specific for Giardia and used this technique to compare the ability of recently planted vegetation strips with bare soil strips cleared of vegetation at decreasing pathogen concentrations; a typical scenario when planting barriers to reduce waterway contamination. A spike containing a bromide tracer and inactivated Giardia cysts was applied in drip-irrigated surface runoff, with one-minute samples collected from the bottom of the plot. A significant treatment effect was identified for Giardia, with 26% fewer detected in runoff from the planted strip, highlighting the immediate benefit of vegetation planting in removing pathogens. 
 Next I evaluated the effects of four riparian treatments on Giardia runoff: exotic pasture grass and weeds growing in the absence of cattle grazing due to fencing, in comparison to monocultural plantings of three New Zealand native grassland species. Runoff experiments were performed after planting, both prior to and following the main summer growing season. Bromide recovery was high from all four treatments (54 - 99%), with no significant treatment effects. By comparison, Giardia recovery was low (1 - 13%). Prior to summer, two native species reduced Giardia in runoff more than the pasture grass/weed treatment which was almost vegetation-free at this time. After summer, Giardia recoveries were uniformly lower in all treatments. These results demonstrate that after one growing season, fencing waterways produces riparian buffers, via the growth of exotic pasture plants released from grazing, that decrease pathogen concentrations in surface runoff to concentrations indistinguishable from native plantings. 
 Given infectious organisms are known to be in the environment, it is important to assess the risk these pose to human populations. Findings from this research can be used to improve currently available risk-assessment models for Giardia transmission from infected dairy animals via water to humans.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="subject">Giardia</field><field name="subject">dairy farming</field><field name="subject">animal waste</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">water in agriculture</field><field name="subject">riparian areas</field><field name="subject">streambank planting</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081219.162139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enthusiasm for disease screening : an ethical critique with a sociological perspective</field><field name="creator">Lau, Yvonne</field><field name="description">Screening is generally considered a useful strategy in the prevention of chronic diseases. The notion is that early detection through the use of certain screening tests can facilitate effective preventive measures to be undertaken which can then lead to improved prognosis from or ultimate avoidance of serious clinical diseases. The enthusiasm for screening in the United States is high and can be seen by the size of public demand for it. Rapid technological advances and knowledge expansion in the past decade have further facilitated the introduction of new tests and screening opportunities. In the mean time, the concept of screening has undergone subtle changes. Previous emphasis on clear and demonstrable population health benefits has been slowly replaced by an emphasis on individual responsibility for the surveillance of personal health risks. Disease screening is frequently advocated as part of a health promotion programme. As a clinician who has worked in breast cancer screening and who is wary of the complexities and problems associated with disease screening, my contention is that the enthusiasm for screening may not ultimately be conducive to health and well-being. 
 This thesis represents an effort to understand the popularity and enthusiasm for disease screening, how it has come about and, why it may not be conducive to health and well-being. The thesis begins with a description of the phenomenon to be followed by a detailed examination of the scientific principles behind disease screening. It then moves on to discover how the phenomenon might have come about by first considering the evolution of biomedicine over the centuries and then its present endeavour in the form of surveillance medicine as well as the latter&#65533;s relationship with today&#65533;s market economy. Using relevant case studies that involve, for example, cancer and prenatal genetic screening, this thesis explores different concerns relating to health and well-being, including such topics as the creation of health roles, the reconfiguration of human values and interpersonal relationships as well as medicalisation. A final chapter offers an account of health and well-being and sums up why the enthusiasm for screening may not be conducive to health and well-being. 
 The enthusiasm for screening compels people to assume health as a moral virtue. Screening is turned into a ritual that people consume to attain salvation. Since diseases may lead to death, diseases must be avoided though screening. Yet health is not just about the absence of disease. Health and well-being can only be realised by the individual within the context of the individual&#65533;s life as a whole. The institution of biomedicine has undeniable responsibility to ensure that screening will not be used to the detriment of individuals&#65533; health and well-being. Without condemning disease screening as a potentially useful tool in the prevention of disease, this thesis advocates prudence in its utilisation. People must not be compelled to attend screening through programmes of promotion (commercially related or not). Rather, autonomous decisions must be facilitated as far as possible through the provision of clear, accurate and factual information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical screening</field><field name="subject">sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090121.085918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of an Orf virus RING-H2 protein, B5L : a mimic of cellular anaphase promoting complex subunit 11</field><field name="creator">Mo, Min</field><field name="description">The anaphase promoting complex (APC/C) is an ubiquitin ligase that is an essential regulator of multiple steps in the cell cycle. The complex consists of at least 12 subunits with a catalytic core formed by a scaffold protein, APC2, and a RING-H2 protein, APC11. The Parapoxvirus, Orf virus (OV), encodes a RING-H2 protein, B5L, with clear sequence similarities to APC11. The disruption of APC/C function leads to pre-mature entry into S phase and a delayed M phase exit and, potentially, apoptosis. This investigation explored the functional significance of the similarity between B5L and APC11 and specifically sought to determine if B5L manipulates cell cycle regulation by targeting APC/C function. 
 Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from lysates of cells expressing a range of constructs revealed an interaction between B5L and APC2 in the same manner as seen with APC11. Furthermore, B5L was found to associate with endogenous APC/C. However, although APC11 promoted the formation of polyubiquitin chains in substrate-independent in vitro assays, B5L was inactive in this assay. Bioinformatics comparisons of APC11 and other known RING ubiquitin ligases with B5L and its poxviral homologues revealed some subtle differences. In particular a domain of APC11 (amino acids 61-74), that is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity is not conserved in B5L or its homologues. When this APC11 domain was incorporated in place of the corresponding region of B5L (amino acids 59-67), the mutated B5L acquired ubiquitin ligase activity. On the other hand, APC11 protein in which the domain was replaced with that of B5L lost ubiquitin ligase activity. 
 Stable cell lines expressing B5L showed an increased number of cells in G2/M phase (30&#65533;4%) compared with cell lines expressing APC11 (11&#65533;2%, n=3, p&lt;0.05, ANOVA, Tukey&#65533;s), consistent with impaired APC/C function. APC/C substrates such as cyclin A, cyclin B and the thymidine kinase were stablized in B5L-expressing cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, transient hyper-expression of B5L induced apoptosis in 25&#65533;2% (n=3, p&lt;0.05) of the cell population compared with only 6&#65533;1% apoptotic cells when APC11 was hyper-expressed. Analysis of the DNA content of OV-infected cells revealed enhanced DNA synthesis compared with cells infected with a B5L knockout OV. 
 These observations indicate that B5L is a non-functional mimic of APC11. It associates with APC/C, but lacks ubiquitin ligase activity, and hence disrupts APC/C function. These abilities may enable OV to induce a cellular environment that enhances viral replication.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orf virus</field><field name="subject">ubiquitin</field><field name="subject">ligases</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090220.085825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conduct of counsel causing or contributing to a miscarriage of justice</field><field name="creator">O'Driscoll, Stephen James</field><field name="description">The Crimes Act 1961 and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provide that a person accused of a criminal offence in New Zealand has the right to be represented at trial by counsel. The purpose of representation by counsel is to protect the accused&#65533;s interests; ensure that the accused is able to present their defence to the Court; ensure that the accused receives a fair trial; and ensure that the accused is not the subject of a miscarriage of justice. 
 It is implicit that criminal defence counsel must be competent if they are to be effective advocates on behalf of their clients. If counsel is not competent, there is a risk that counsel&#65533;s acts or omissions may cause or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
 The Crimes Act 1961 allows an accused to appeal against their conviction on the basis that they have been the subject of a miscarriage of justice through the conduct of their counsel. The thesis analyses the Supreme Court decision of R v Sungsuwan that sets out the test that an appellate court must consider when deciding to allow an appeal based on the conduct of counsel. 
 The thesis examines 239 Court of Appeal decisions between 1996 and 2007 that have considered appeals from jury trials where at least one of the grounds of appeal was that defence counsel caused or contributed to a miscarriage of justice. The thesis notes the increasing trend to use "conduct of counsel" as a ground of appeal. In 1996 there were 4 appeals; in 2006 there were 43 such appeals and in 2007 there were 29 appeals. 
 During the period under review the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and specifically held that counsel&#65533;s conduct, either alone or in combination with other grounds, caused or contributed to a miscarriage of justice in 41 cases. The thesis analyses the common complaints made by an accused against trial counsel and the common areas where the Court of Appeal upheld complaints against counsel. 
 The thesis takes into account the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006 and the Lawyers and Conveyancers (Lawyer: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 that came into existence on 1 August 2008. The new legislation places particular emphasis on the obligations of counsel to uphold the rule of law and to facilitate the administration of justice in New Zealand. Counsel also has an obligation to protect the interests of their clients. 
 The thesis concludes that the plethora of cases coming before the Court of Appeal, and the number of appeals allowed by the Court, demonstrate defence counsel do not always protect the interests of their clients and can cause or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
 The thesis makes a number of recommendations that may reduce the risk of both an accused appealing on the basis on the conduct of counsel and an appeal being allowed on the basis of the conduct of counsel. In particular, it is suggested that there should be greater degree of co-operation between the New Zealand Law Society and the Legal Services Agency to ensure the maintenance of high standards among criminal defence lawyers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">judicial error</field><field name="subject">lawyers</field><field name="subject">complaints against</field><field name="subject">malpractice</field><field name="subject">negligence</field><field name="subject">criminal law</field><field name="subject">conduct of court proceedings</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.091357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metalloid mobility at historic mine and industrial processing sites in the South Island of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haffert, Laura</field><field name="description">Rocks of the South Island of New Zealand are locally enriched in metalloids, namely arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) and boron (B). Elevated levels of As and Sb can be found in sulphide minerals mostly in association with mesothermal gold deposits, whereas B enrichment occurs in marine influenced coal deposits. The mobility of these metalloids is important because they can be toxic at relatively low levels (e.g. for humans &gt;0.01 mg/L of As). Their mobilisation occurs naturally from background weathering of the bedrock. However, mining and processing of coal and gold deposits, New Zealand's most economically important commodities, can significantly increase metalloid mobility. In particular, historic mines and associated industrial sites are known to generate elevated metalloid levels because of the lack of site remediation upon closure. This work defines and quantifies geological, mining, post-mining and regional processes with respect to metalloid, especially As, mobility.
At the studied historic gold mines, the Blackwater and Bullendale mines, Sb levels in mineralised rocks were generally negligible (&lt;14 ppm) compared to As (up to 10,000 ppm). Thus, Sb concentrations in solids and in water were too low to yield any meaningful information on Sb mobility. In contrast, dissolved As concentrations downstream from mine sites were found to be very high (up to 59 mg/L) (background = 10&#8315;&#65533; mg/L). In addition, very high As concentrations were found in residues (up to 40 wt%) and site substrate (up to 30 wt%) at the Blackwater processing sites (background &lt; 0.05 wt%). Here, roasting of the gold ore converted the orginal As mineral, arsenopyrite, into the mineral arsenolite (As[III] trioxide polymorph) and volatilised the sulphur. The resultant sulphur-defficient chemical system is driven by arsenolite dissolution and differs significantly from mine sites where arsenopyrite is the main As source.
Arsenolite is significantly more soluble than arsenopyrite. In the surficial environment, arsenolite dissolution is limited by kinetics only, which are slow enough to preserve exposed arsenolite over decades in a temperate, wet climate. This process results in surface waters with up to ca. 50 mg/L dissolved As. In reducing conditions, dissolved As concentrations are also controlled by the solubility of arsenolite producing As concentrations up to 330 mg/L.
Field based cathodic stripping voltammetry showed that the As[III]/As[V] redox couple, in particular the oxidation of As[III], has a major control on system pH and Eh. Site acidification is mainly caused by the oxidation of As[III], resulting in a close link between As[V] concentrations and pH. Similarly, a strong correlation between calculated (Nernstian) and measured (electrode) Eh was found in the surface environment, suggesting that the overall Eh of the system is, indeed, defined by the As[III]/As[V] redox couple.
Once the metalloid is mobilised from its original source, its mobility is controlled by at least one of the following attenuation processes: (a) precipitation of secondary metalloid minerals, (b) co-precipitation with - or adsorption to - iron oxyhydroxide (HFO), or (c) dilution with background waters. The precipitation of secondary minerals is most favoured in the case of As due to the relatively low solubility of iron arsenates, especially at low pH (~0.1 mg/L). Observations suggest that scorodite can be the precursor phase to more stable iron arsenates, such as kankite, zykaite, bukovskyite or pharmacosiderite and their stability is mainly controlled by pH, sulphur concentrations and moisture prevalence. Empirical evidence indicates that the sulphur-containing minerals zykaite and bukovskyite have a similar pH dependence to scorodite with solubilities slightly lower than scorodite and kankite. If dissolved As concentrations decline, iron arsenates potentially become unstable. Their dissolution maintains a pH between 2.5 and 3.5. This acidification process is pivotal with respect to As mobility, especially in the absence of other acidification processes, because iron arsenates are several orders of magnitude more soluble in circum-neutral pH regimes (~100 mg/L). From this, it becomes apparent that external pH modifications, for example as part of a remediation scheme, can significantly increase iron arsenate solubility and resultant As mobility. In contrast to As, the precipitation of secondary Sb and B minerals is limited by their high solubilities, which are several orders of magnitude higher than for iron arsenates. Thus, secondary Sb and B minerals are restricted to evaporative waters, from which they can easily re-mobilised during rain events.
Metalloid adsorption to HFO is mainly controlled or limited by the extent of HFO formation, which in turn is governed by the availability of Fe and prevailing Eh-pH conditions. Thus, mineralisation styles and associated geochemical gradients, in particular pyrite abundance, can control the amount of HFO and consequent metalloid attenuation, and these can vary even within the same goldfleld. Furthermore, it was found that there is a mineralogical gradation between ferrihydrite with varying amounts of adsorbed As, amorphous iron arsenates and crystalline iron arsenates, suggesting that the maturity of mine waste is an important factor in As mineralogy.
Once dissolved metalloids enter the hydrosphere, dilution is the main control on metalloid attenuation, which is especially pronounced at the inflow of tributaries. Dilution is, therefore, closely related to the size and frequency of these tributaries, which in turn are controlled by the regional topography and climate. Dilution is a considerably less effective attenuation mechanism and anomalous metalloid concentrations from mining related sites can persist for over 10 km downstream.
The complex and often inter-dependent controls on metalloid mobility mean that management decisions should carefully consider the specific site geochemistry to minimize economic, health and environmental risks that can not be afforded.
On a regional scale, background metalloid flux determines the downstream impact of an anomalous metalloid source upstream. For example, the Bullendale mine is located in a mountainous region, where rapidly eroding slopes expose fresh rock and limit the extent of soil cover and chemical weathering. Consequently, the background As flux is relatively low and As point sources, such as the Bullendale mine, present a significant contribution to the downstream As flux. In contrast, the bedrock at the Blackwater mine has undergone deep chemical weathering, resulting in an increased background mobilisation of As. Thus, the Prohibition mill site discharge, for example, contributes only about 10% to the downstream As flux. This information is relevant to site management decisions because the amount of natural background metalloid mobilisation determines whether site remediation will influence downstream metalloid chemistry on a regional scale.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arsenic</field><field name="subject">antimony</field><field name="subject">boron</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">gold mines and mining</field><field name="subject">coal mines and mining</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090921.144328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value of organisational learning and structure in entrepreneurial strategy development in dynamic environments</field><field name="creator">Chagoubatov, Alexandre</field><field name="description">Modern perspectives on strategy often attempt to address one question &#147;whether the strategy will achieve wealth transfer or create new wealth?&#148; While wealth transfer strategies may deliver one time gains to shareholders, they don't fundamentally change a company's long-term earning potential. These strategies don't create new wealth because they don't create new products, new markets, or new customers. The increasing difficulty of finding new wealth creation is a result of a fundamental shift in the business operating environment in which opportunities are sought after. Competing in such an environment is increasingly difficult and as a result, the value of strategic resources has shifted to more intangible resources. This study is concerned with exploring relationships that are considered to be instrumental to creating new wealth. It identifies entrepreneurial strategic posture as a widely supported approach to creating new wealth. The thesis also discusses organisational learning and structure as two intangible strategic resources that are increasingly valuable to successful strategy formulation and implementation. Furthermore the thesis considers organisational perceptions about the operating environment and seeks to relate resource configuration and strategic decision-making to these perceptions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational learning</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Ao o te whaiko&#772;rero</field><field name="creator">Rewi, Poia</field><field name="description">Te Ao o te Whaiko&#772;rero, the &#65533;world of Ma&#772;ori oratory&#65533;, explores the complexity of &#770;Ma&#772;ori oratory, both past and present. What makes whaiko&#772;rero more than merely a theatrical speech is the origin and function of the various components, the rites associated with the selection and qualification of its exponents, and its delivery. This thesis delves into the underlying philosophies inherent in whaiko&#772;rero which impact on, and are influenced by, a diverse range of systems within the Ma&#772;ori world, its culture, etiquette, and belief system. We must also recognise the effect of colonisation and urbanisation on Ma&#772;ori practices. Whaiko&#772;rero is tragically undermined by some of its &#65533;performers&#65533; and observers alike, and possibly, through ignorance, arrogance and complacency, a sense of disregard has developed about its true value. The effect of this is whaiko&#772;rero of inferior quality. With this in mind, this thesis expounds the &#65533;underlying philosophies&#65533; of whaiko&#772;rero through both oral and literary sources, as well as objective and subjective discussion.
	The chapters illustrate the inter-tribal, intra-tribal, and individual variations which make each delivery of whaiko&#772;rero unique. The thesis begins with the origin of whaiko&#772;rero, after which modes of learning and the acquisition of whaiko&#772;rero are discussed. This provides the basis to discuss the locations where whaiko&#772;rero takes place and who is permitted to deliver whaiko&#772;rero. Having designated the people to deliver whaiko&#772;rero and their &#65533;space&#65533; for delivery there is an exploration of the speaker, and the attributes which qualify a particular individual, or the type of delivery that is acceptable. The issue of &#65533;quality&#65533;, or lack of it, is of paramount importance in terms of the mana of the individual performer, and the people (s)he represents. The range of information discussed up to this point is historical and tracks the evolution of whaiko&#772;rero to the present; the conclusion, therefore, also addresses some of the issues raised which are potentially challenging in regard to current adherence to custom and etiquette. This opens the window into the future of whaiko&#772;rero, and what adaptations may lie ahead. Perhaps with broader, and more in-depth discussion, and in particular, the explanation of the diversity of whaiko&#772;rero, this thesis will provide a) a means by which the spirit of older whaiko&#772;rero can be reinvested in the modern context by current and potential orators, and b) raise the awareness of speakers whereby they themselves can seek excellence in their own whaiko&#772;rero. Perhaps with an invigorated approach to both the delivery, observance, and a more informed appreciation of whaiko&#772;rero, there will be a resurgence of excellence in whaiko&#772;rero.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Maori language</field><field name="subject">Maori speeches</field><field name="subject">Spoken Maori</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060705.121343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the eukaryotic translation termination sequence element</field><field name="creator">Cridge, Andrew Graham</field><field name="description">Termination of protein synthesis occurs in response to the translocation of a stop codon (UAA, UAG or UGA) into the A site of the ribosome. Unlike sense codons, stop signals in the mRNA are recognized by two classes of specialized proteins called release factors (RFs): the class I or decoding RF, which recognizes the stop codon and promotes peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and class II RF, a G-protein that promotes the dissociation of the decoding RF from the ribosome. The discovery that stop codons are decoded by a protein factor rather than a specific tRNA opened up the possibility that the signal for termination of protein synthesis might extend beyond the stop codon itself. Biochemical and genetic experiments in prokaryotes confirmed that bias in nucleotide usage around stop codons correlates with translation termination efficiency. The objective of the current investigation was to define the eukaryotic termination signal by determining the bias in the nucleotide sequence surrounding eukaryotic stop codons and to identify whether this was a determinant of translation termination efficiency. 
 Bioinformatic analysis of five diverse eukaryotic genomes was undertaken to identify potential eukaryotic translation termination signal elements. Significant nucleotide bias was identified both 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon in all the genomes investigated. Correlations were identified between nucleotide bias and gene expression levels, and between nucleotide bias and natural recoding sites predicting that nucleotides 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon affect termination efficiency. These correlations were common to all organisms investigated and suggested the existence of a eukaryotic termination signal. 
 Termination signals identified from the bioinformatic analysis were assayed to determine the efficiency of termination in an in vitro dual luciferase reporter assay. Results indicated that nucleotides both 5&#65533; and 3&#65533; of the stop codon could significantly alter termination signal efficiency, although readthrough did not vary by greater than 1%. The effect of nucleotides 3&#65533; to the stop codon on termination efficiency was investigated further in mammalian cultured cells using the dual luciferase reporter assay. Results showed a significant relationship between the identity of these nucleotides and observed termination efficiencies with nucleotides at positions +4 and +8 giving the strongest correlation. Termination sequence elements of the form UGA CUN NCN mediated up to 5% readthrough in cultured cells. 
 Investigations into the underlying mechanisms that were responsible for the variation in termination efficiency were also undertaken. Co-transfection of specific suppressor tRNAs enhanced but did not change the pattern of observed termination efficiency, indicating that the mechanisms mediated by the termination signal element was not mediated through suppressor tRNA binding. Alignments of 18S rRNA sequences indicated potential extensive interactions between the rRNA and the mRNA termination signal element. Experiments that assessed the effect of eRF1 levels on termination at inefficient termination signals in vitro revealed that increased levels of eRF1 could improve termination efficiency. 
 These results indicate that, as in prokaryotes, specific nucleotides beyond the stop codon modulate translation termination efficiency in eukaryotes, and that the translation termination signal should be considered a sequence element.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eukaryotic cells</field><field name="subject">protein synthesis</field><field name="subject">RNA protein interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060804.095722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of web metrics for online strategic decision-making</field><field name="creator">Weischedel, Birgit</field><field name="description">"I know but one freedom, and that is the freedom of the mind" Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 
 Web metrics offer significant potential for online businesses to incorporate high-quality, real-time information into their strategic marketing decision-making (SDM) process. This SDM process is affected by the firm&#65533;s strategic direction, which is critical for web businesses. A review of the widely researched strategy and SDM literature identified that managers use extensive information to support and improve strategic decisions and make informed decisions. Offline SDM processes might be appropriate for the online environment but the limited literature on web metrics has not researched information needs for online SDM. Even though web metrics can be a valuable tool for web businesses to inform strategic marketing decisions, and their collection might be less expensive and easier than offline measures, virtually no published research has combined web metrics and SDM concepts into one research project. 
 To address this gap in the literature, the thesis investigated the differences and commonalities of online and offline SDM process approaches, the use of web metrics categories for online SDM stages, and the issues encountered during that process through four research questions. A preliminary conceptual model based on the literature review was refined through preliminary research, which addressed the research questions and investigated the current state of web metrics. 
 After investigating various methodologies, a multi-stage qualitative methodology was selected. The use of qualitative methods represents a contribution to knowledge regarding methodological approaches to online research. Four stages within the online SDM process were shown to benefit from the use of web metrics: the setting of priorities, the setting of objectives, the pretest stage and the review stage. The results identified the similarity of online and offline SDM processes; demonstrated that Traffic, Transactions, Customer Feedback and Consumer Behaviour categories provide basic metrics used by most companies; identified the Environment, Technology, Business Results and Campaigns categories as supplementary categories that are applied according to the marketing objectives; and investigated the results based on different types of companies (website classification, channel focus, size and cluster association). Three clusters were identified that relate to the strategic importance of the website and web metrics. 
 Modifying the initial conceptual model, six issues were distinguished that affect the use of web metrics: the adoption and use of web metrics by managers; the integration of multiple sources of metrics; the establishment of industry benchmarks; data quality; the differences to offline measures; as well as resource constraints that interfere with the appropriate web metrics analysis. Links to offline marketing strategy literature and established business concepts were explored and explanations provided where the results confirmed or modified these concepts. 
 Using qualitative methods, the research assisted in building theory of web metrics and online SDM processes. The results show that offline theories apply to the online environment and conventional concepts provide guidance for online processes. Dynamic aspects of strategy relate to the online environment, and qualitative research methods appear suitable for online research.

An increasing number of studies are suggesting that imprinted genes have a major influence on medically, agriculturally and evolutionarily important traits, such as disease severity and livestock production traits. While some genes have a large effect on the traits of an individual, quantitative characters such as height are influenced by many genes and by the environment, including maternal effects. The interaction between these genes and the environment produces variation in the characteristics of individuals. Many quantitative characters are likely to be influenced by a small number of imprinted genes, but at present there is no general theoretical model of the quantitative genetics of imprinting incorporating multiple loci, environmental effects and maternal effects. This research develops models for the quantitative genetics of imprinting incorporating these effects, including deriving expressions for genetic variation and resemblances between relatives. Imprinting introduces both parent-of-origin and generation dependent differences in the derivation of standard quantitative genetic models that are generally equivalent under Mendelian expression. Further, factors such as epistasis, maternal effects and interactions between genotype and environment may mask the effect of imprinting in a quantitative trait. Maternal effects may also mimic a number of signatures in variance and covariance components that are expected in a population with genomic imprinting. This research allows a more comprehensive understanding of the processes influencing an individual&#65533;s characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">genomic imprinting</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060811.134008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A bioeconomic analysis of marine reserves for Paua (Abalone) management at Stewart Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Viktoria</field><field name="description">Marine reserves have increasingly been recognised for their potential to address the pervasive problem of unsustainable harvest of fisheries worldwide. Biologists advocate the benefits of increased spawning biomass, larger modal sizes and greater densities of fish within marine reserves, and the possibility of spillover to adjacent fishable areas. Bioeconomic studies, however, find that pay-offs from stand-alone marine reserves rarely compete with sustainable yield management schemes, but that they can be beneficial when stocks are heavily exploited. Most of these bioeconomic models are analytical and deterministic in nature, and therefore ignore the redistribution of effort in response to closure and the inherent uncertainty of the marine environment. 
 We present a bioeconomic analysis of a network of no-take areas around Stewart Island in New Zealand applied to the shellfish species paua (abalone) that incorporates both predicted redistribution and reduction in effort, as well as stochastic recruitment. A nested logit model is applied to spatially recorded catch and effort data by the Ministry of Fisheries between 1998 and 2003 to capture the two level decision-making process of divers. On any given day, divers decide whether to go diving at all, and if so, which of the 16 statistical areas around Stewart Island to visit. Weather conditions, spatially varying levels of catch per unit of effort and distance are used as explanatory variables to select areas for closure according to the &#65533;least economic impact&#65533; in terms of loss of diving trips. An age-structured biological model is developed with parameters specifically applied to paua stocks around Stewart Island. Virgin paua biomass as of 1974 is estimated on the basis of growth, survival, post-larval recruitment and egg production in the absence of fishing. Historic catch rates are then applied to find overall and area-specific levels of exploitation rates, spawning biomass, egg production, legal biomass and numbers of paua. In a final step, the economic model is linked to the biological model to simulate the imposition of no-take areas when taking account of the initial disproportional shift of harvest to fished areas in the first year, and the increase in overall pressure on legal biomass in the years thereafter. 
 We contribute to the marine reserve debate by showing that in the very long run, the overall yield under closure of a relatively small area approaches and even slightly surpasses the yield under no closure for an assumed spillover gradient of 40% despite the redistribution of effort. The most important benefits of marine reserves emerge when stochastic recruitment is included in the recruitment function. In practice, predictions about the stock status and the impact of different harvest levels become much more difficult when acknowledging the inherent variability of the marine environment. The likelihood of stock collapse depends on the assumed value of two recruitment parameters, which highlights the effects of parameter uncertainty and emphasizes the role of marine reserves for population persistence. We also show that under uncertainty average yields under a management regime of a network of no-take areas in addition to the quota system can equal yields under no closure for an assumed spillover gradient of 40%, despite the increased pressure on areas adjacent to the closed areas. 
 Our findings have significant implications for the management of the paua fishery at Stewart Island. For a heterogeneously abundant species, such as paua, spatial management in addition to quota limits could be vital in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the fishery given the inherent variability of the marine environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abalone</field><field name="subject">paua fisheries</field><field name="subject">marine parks and reserves</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island</field><field name="subject">econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060823.160930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dimensions of intangible value in business-to-business buyer-seller relationships: an intellectual capital model</field><field name="creator">Baxter, Roger</field><field name="description">A firm&#65533;s relationships with its customers contribute to its organizational capital and represent an important part of its shareholder value, so the nature of the value in these relationships needs to be understood well and managed carefully. Marketing managers therefore require techniques that will assess relationship value comprehensively in order to manage their portfolio of customer relationships effectively and in order to argue for a sufficient share of the firm&#65533;s resources to develop these market based assets for competitive advantage. At present, there is a well-established technique for assessing customer profitability analysis which assigns revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities to customers and algebraically sums their value to reach a profitability figure for each customer. 
 However, even in its more sophisticated forms, the primary focus of customer profitability analysis as it is currently used tends to be the management of profitability by way of the management of existing situations, and particularly of cost, rather than the management of the value that is potentially available in the future from the intangible aspects of a relationship. Without knowledge of the dimensions of intangible value in the relationship, the technique is restricted to assessing those relationship aspects that can be easily quantified in dollar terms by the modification of existing accounting information. 
 This leaves a gap in the available toolbox for managers in assessing relationship value, because much of the value of a relationship may be in its intangible aspects, which at present can not be readily assessed other than by a manager&#65533;s experience and intuition. In order to develop techniques specifically for intangible value assessment, it is necessary to understand the dimensions of this intangible value. Development of scales to measure the dimensions of this intangible relationship value and development of an understanding of its structure is thus a useful research goal, which is supported by calls in the literature for the quantification of market-based assets and their value Elucidation of the dimensions and structure of intangible relationship value is therefore the goal of this thesis. 
 Although there are recent reports in the literature of studies that include the intangible aspects of relationship value, most of those that have been conducted in a business-to-business context appear to be primarily concerned with investigating the drivers of value rather than its dimensions, and those that deal with the business-to-consumer context describe techniques to assess the aggregated value of many consumers, rather than an individual buyer as is required for business-to-business applications. The thesis therefore proposes a conceptual framework, synthesised from the intellectual capital literature, which provides a set of six dimensions and a structure of intangible business-to-business buyer-seller value. The six proposed dimensions are unique in that they cover the human aspects of the relationship extensively. 
 The thesis describes the testing of the proposed conceptual framework. This was achieved primarily by the use of the structural equation modelling technique on survey data that was collected from managers in the New Zealand manufacturing industry, following qualitatively analysed interviews with managers. The tests support the framework and its value dimensions.

Furthermore, most investigations in the area of mood-related response styles have relied on participants self-report responses of their mood reactivity, which is considered to be susceptible to demand characteristics and response bias. Psychophysiological measures are thought to offer a unique and alternative measure of mood reactivity that can corroborate, or challenge self-report findings. They are considered to be less susceptible to demand effects than self-report, and can detect subtle changes in mood reactivity activity when an overt response is not apparent. In view of this, the primary objective of this thesis was to move beyond a reliance on subjective self-report measurements of mood reactivity, and to investigate the consequences of depressed mood-related cognitive response styles from a psychophysiological perspective. As part of this investigation, this thesis aims to address a number of theoretical and practical questions relating to the use of psychophysiological measures in mood research and clinical practice. 
 The research is divided into four studies, each one focusing on a particular aspect of the investigation. 
 The aim of Study 1 was to select and trial a laboratory-based mood induction procedure (MIP) and a self-report mood measure, with the intention of developing a reliable method of inducing and measuring depressed mood. Two film clips that contained either positive or negative affective content were presented to participants. Self-report responses on the Mood Scale confirmed that the negative film clip elicited a very unpleasant mood state with high emotional arousal, and that the positive film clip elicited a mildly pleasant mood state with low emotional arousal. The positive and negative Film Clip MIPs were then used in Studies 2 and 2a, to investigate participants&#65533; psychophysiological reactivity to induced mood. 
 The aim of Studies 2 and 2a was to identify a set of psychophysiological measures that would differentiate between participants&#65533; mood states. In Study 2, the positive and negative Film Clip MIPs, from Study 1, were again presented to participants. Corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity, zygomaticus major facial EMG activity, skin conductance activity (SCA), heart rate (plethysmograph, sphygmomanometer), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and self-report ratings on the Mood Scale were recorded. Results confirmed that participant self-reported affective responses were similar to those reported in Study 1; however, mixed results were obtained in regards to individuals&#65533; psychophysiological responses to the MIPs. Facial EMG activity and heart rate (plethysmograph) were consistent with participants&#65533; self-reported mood, whereas, SCA and systolic blood pressure were inconsistent with participants&#65533; self-reported mood. Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (sphygmomanometer) did not differentiate between the MIPs. As the results were somewhat contradictory to expectations, it was decided to further investigate the psychophysiology of induced mood in Study 2a, using a revised set of psychophysiological measures. 
 In Study 2a, the positive and negative Film Clip MIPs were again presented to participants. Corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity, zygomaticus major facial EMG activity, SCA, heart rate (ECG), and finger temperature, were recorded along with participants&#65533; Mood Scale ratings. It was found that facial EMG activity and SCA, paralleled participant self-report as expected, and were most responsive to participants&#65533; change in mood state. Heart rate (ECG) and finger temperature did not clearly differentiate between the induced mood states. 
 The aim of Study 3 was to conduct an experimental, laboratory-based investigation, into the psychophysiological and subjective mood consequences of two cognitive response styles: self-focused depressive rumination and external-focused distraction. As in the previous study, the negative Film Clip MIP and the Mood Scale were used to induce depressed mood and to measure participants&#65533; subjective mood state. Psychophysiological reactivity was recorded by measuring participants&#65533; corrugator supercilii facial EMG, zygomaticus major facial EMG, SCA, heart rate (sphygmomanometer), systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Trait response style was measured using the Response Style Questionnaire (RSQ; Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1991) and social desirability was measured using the Marlowe Crowne-Social Desirability Scale (MC-SDS; Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960). As predicted by the Response Style Theory of depression (RST), increased self-reported negative mood was found when participants responded to the induced depressed mood, using a self-focused depressive rumination response style, rather than an external-focused distraction response style. Psychophysiological activity increased over the course of the negative Film Clip MIP for all psychophysiological measures, however, only corrugator supercilii facial EMG activity clearly differentiated between the cognitive response styles, in a way predicted by individuals&#65533; self-report responses. There was no evidence of a relationship between participants&#65533; trait response style and their psychophysiological reactivity or mood responses during the experiment. However, individuals high in trait rumination reported greater depressive symptomatology, and less mood reactivity during the experiment, than those high in trait distraction. Furthermore, participants&#65533; ratings of social desirability were positively associated with their level of depressive symptomatology and trait rumination. 
 The aim of Study 4 was to conduct a pilot study to investigate the psychophysiological consequences of two further cognitive response styles: negative automatic thoughts and positive autobiographical recall. A series of twelve single-case (ABC-ABC) experiments were carried out using a procedure analogous to a clinical therapy process. Initially a depressed Story MIP was used to induce a depressed mood in participants (A). Participants were then required to respond to their depressed mood using negative self-statements (B), and positive autobiographical recall (C). Consistent with previous studies, zygomaticus major facial EMG and corrugator supercilii facial EMG clearly paralleled participants&#65533; mood reactivity throughout the experiment, whereas SCA and heart rate showed less consistent patterns of reactivity. 
 This thesis has made an important contribution to mood and psychophysiological research by presenting the first in-depth investigation into the psychophysiological consequences of how people respond to depressed mood, from both a theoretical and a clinical perspective. It is anticipated that the findings of this research will bring about further investigation into the comparative efficacy of various brief mood-related cognitive intervention techniques, which will ultimately assist scientist-practitioners in selecting suitable brief cognitive intervention techniques for helping clients ameliorate their negative mood, emotional, and cognitive states.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mood (psychology)</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">psychophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060831.114812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an understanding of the effect of revival evidenced in the writings of George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards</field><field name="creator">Jull, David</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the revivalist writings of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) and George Whitefield (1714-1770) for evidence that the Great Awakening altered their perspective on revival. It is principally based on primary sources written between 1736 and 1743. Six separate chapters explore their background, their understanding of revival, their efforts at propagating it, their techniques in managing the revival, their defense of revival, and their institutionalization of revival. 
 Both their understandings of revival came from their own observations of the revivals that accompanied their evangelistic efforts. Their theological background, heavily influenced by Calvin, insisted that God was responsible for both conversions and revival. 
 The thesis notes that Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; use of four primary techniques to propagate revival evolved as they experienced revival. Their preaching, their organization of small, religious education groups, their publishing of sermons, and their written narratives of revival all show signs of adaptation to changing circumstances. 
 Both managed revival by using small groups and publications to guide people way from inappropriate spiritual expressions. These groups and documents also provided opportunities to educate new converts about their spiritual experiences. Edwards and Whitefield had the opportunity to clarify their understanding of revival as they defended the revival against those critics who questioned their claims about God&#65533;s role in the religious events of 1735-1743. 
 Both institutionalized revival by interacting with the next generation of evangelical ministers and by making available their doctrines and their own experiences in their published narratives. This propensity to publish their reflections on revival allowed future generations access to their revival principles. 
 The overriding hypothesis of this study is that Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; understanding of revival grew out of their involvement in revival in the eighteenth century religious revivals of colonial North America and that their revival writings and preaching were attempts to codify and transfer the lessons they had learned about revival to future generations of Christians who might, they hoped, themselves experience a God-ordained time of revival. 
 The key conclusions of this study are that 1) Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; positions on revival issues developed through repeated exposures to revival, 2) Whitefield and Edwards used similar means to propagate, manage, defend, and institutionalize revival, 3) Whitefield&#65533;s sermons and journals themselves express a clear and concise theology, 4) a comparison of Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; theology refutes the suggestion that the lack of a uniform theology throughout the colonies negates the reality of the Great Awakening, 5) a careful study of Whitefield&#65533;s and Edwards&#65533; revival writings produces a heightened awareness of the nature of their narrative works, 6) Edwards&#65533; revival writings show a concern for worship that is too often missed in studies of his work, 7) Edwards and Whitefield were actively involved in developing, recording, and teaching the principles of authentic revival.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">George Whitefield (1714-1770)</field><field name="subject">Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)</field><field name="subject">evangelical revival</field><field name="subject">Great Awakening</field><field name="subject">preaching</field><field name="subject">United States church history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060908.150022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning algebra in an activity-based mathematics programme</field><field name="creator">Linsell, Chris</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the findings of a research project which explored students&#65533; learning during an activity-based mathematics programme. The research investigated what students learnt about solving linear equations and examined the role of activities in this learning. 
 The investigation of learning in the classroom was guided by the principles of naturalistic enquiry. A longitudinal study was used to investigate students&#65533; learning during a unit of work that that made extensive use of activities and contexts. The longitudinal design of the study allowed the development of algebraic thinking to be investigated. The ideas of both Piaget and Vygotsky suggest that it is necessary to study the process of change in order to understand the thinking of students. A group of four students, two girls and two boys, were studied for twenty-seven lessons with each student interviewed individually within six days of each lesson, using the technique of stimulated recall. All lessons and interviews were recorded for subsequent transcription and analysis. 
 Learning to solve equations formally, using inverse operations, proved to be difficult for all the students. For two of them, their poor understandings of arithmetic structure and inverse operations were impediments that prevented them from doing more than attempt to follow procedures. Two of the students did succeed in using inverse operations to solve equations, but were still reasoning arithmetically. There was little evidence in the data that any of the students got to the point of regarding equations as objects to act on. They consistently focussed on the arithmetic procedures required for inverse operations. Even by the end of the topic the most able student, like the others, was still struggling to write algebraic statements. One of the most striking features of the results was the slow progress of the students. For at least two of the students, lack of prerequisite numeracy skills provided a good explanation of why this was so. However for the other two, poor numeracy did not appear to be a reason. The findings are, however, perhaps not too surprising. For children learning about arithmetic, the change from a process to an object view, from counting strategies to part/whole strategies, seems a particularly difficult transition to make. To move from a process to an object view of equations appears to be a similarly difficult transition. 
 The way in which the students made use of the contexts showed that the activities did not directly facilitate the students to develop an understanding of formal solution processes. The students did not usually make use of the contexts when solving equations, working at the abstract symbolic level instead. Although it was hoped that, by engaging students in meaningful activities, the students would construct understandings of formal solution processes, this did not occur. None of the activities used in the study provided a metaphor for the formal method of solving equations. It is suggested that, for a context to be of great value for teaching a mathematical concept, the physical activity should act as a metaphor for the intended mathematical activity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">algebra</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">activity programs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061016.161725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dislocation: deinstitutionalisation in the lives of families of people with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Mirfin-Veitch, Brigit</field><field name="description">This thesis is based on a research project that explored the deinstitutionalisation and eventual closure of a large residential facility for people with an intellectual disability. The thesis is focused on family experiences of deinstitutionalisation in order to understand how families interacted with this major process of social change, and pays specific attention to the role of adult siblings within this context. 
 Unstructured interviews were held with thirty-five families who had family members with an intellectual disability who were being resettled from an institution to alternative disability support services. Families were interviewed at three specific phases during the deinstitutionalisation process: prior to the resettlement of their family member; 1-3 months following resettlement; and one year after resettlement. In keeping with the constructivist paradigm that underpinned this qualitative study, repeated contact with families enabled me to develop some insights into how families made decisions relevant to their family members&#65533; transitions from the institutional environment. 
 The study findings highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of families. While families who participated in this study were found to have shared a similar journey toward institutionalisation, their responses and reactions to deinstitutionalisation and the decision-making associated with such a process were more diverse. My analysis presents the notion that taking a constructivist approach to theorising can facilitate an understanding of how families are influenced in their decision-making with regards to the resettlement of a family member with an intellectual disability. That is, we may be able to gain greater understanding of families&#65533; perceptions of their family members who have an intellectual disability and, subsequently, the decisions that families make regarding the care of that person by exploring the meanings they assign to their world. Ascertaining how families come to construct their understandings of disability is, in my view, critical to responding appropriately to families&#65533; needs within the context of disability support and service provision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">people with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">deinstitutionalization</field><field name="subject">community mental health services</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061024.151035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invertebrate diversity and vegetation heterogeneity : plant-invertebrate relationships in indigenous New Zealand grasslands</field><field name="creator">Rate, Stephen R.</field><field name="description">Spatial heterogeneity of the environment, as measured by floral diversity, composition and structure, is known to influence the distribution and diversity of invertebrates. Heterogeneity brought about by anthropogenic disturbance may be a threat to invertebrate diversity. This thesis investigates the impacts of vegetation heterogeneity at a range of scales on the diversity of invertebrate populations in modified high-altitude indigenous grasslands on the Rock and Pillar Range, Central Otago. 
 Invertebrates were sampled in and on the edges of snow tussock fragments to assess whether species richness increased systematically with fragment area. Invertebrate composition was poorly related to fragment area, plant composition and environmental variables. Taxon richness, abundance and/or diversity for three invertebrate groups increased as fragment area decreased, perhaps reflecting an influx of species from the surrounding matrix. For snow tussock leaf invertebrates in autumn, richness and abundance were at least two times lower in tussocks exposed to the wind than those in the centre of fragments, suggesting selection of habitat may be based on microclimatic characteristics. 
 Invertebrates were sampled from the bases of tussocks after they were clipped to simulate three levels of vertebrate grazing. Invertebrate community composition differed between sites and sampling dates but was unaffected by clipping treatment. At the higher altitude site invertebrate abundance was 1.45 times greater and Shannon-Wiener diversity (H&#65533;) 1.22 times lower than at the lower altitude site. The latter sampling date had higher abundance (2.12 times) and taxon richness (1.14 times) than the earlier date. 
 Pitfall-trapped invertebrates in cushionfield, herbfield and snow tussock differed in community composition and often by taxon richness, abundance and diversity. Across habitats, plant composition, plant diversity and some environmental variables were correlated with invertebrate variables, but could not be separated from vegetation type. 
 The invertebrates collected in the course of the study are listed. Four Phyla, eight Classes, 24 orders and over 300 taxa were recorded. Almost all taxa are endemic and many have limited distributions and/or are undescribed. A species list is provided with collection altitude, method and habitat type. 
 Invertebrate assemblages from sites differing in altitude, vegetation type and level of habitat modification on the Rock and Pillar Range are compared. Sites differed in species composition and rank orders of abundance and richness. At lower elevations, invertebrate richness was at least 25% less, and standardised trap abundance at least 44% less, than that at the highest elevation. Richness and abundance of exotic invertebrates decreased with increasing altitude. 
 This thesis highlights several points concerning the study of grassland invertebrates and heterogeneity on the Rock and Pillar Range. First, there are differences in invertebrate assemblages at a range of scales. Conserving invertebrate diversity will therefore require altitudinal sequences and different habitat types, including disturbed areas. At high elevations, tussock habitat may be disproportionately important due to its relative rarity. Second, the effects of disturbance on invertebrates were only visible at large spatial scales. Third, there is a paucity of research on New Zealand invertebrates, especially in regard to terrestrial disturbance, which has resulted in a shortfall of biological, distributional, taxonomic and ecological knowledge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">invertebrate populations</field><field name="subject">grassland</field><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">Rock and Pillar Range</field><field name="subject">sampling (statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061025.144447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of the representational mind</field><field name="creator">Walker, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Theory of mind has been described in philosophical and psychological literature as "folk psychology", and is the tacit understanding that our behaviour is driven by our thoughts, desires and beliefs (Wellman, Cross, &amp; Watson, 2001). Children are widely considered to have attained theory of mind understanding when they are able to pass the test of false belief understanding devised by Wimmer and Perner (1983), at around 4 years of age. There are many theories as to how a child comes to hold a folk psychology, including innate modularism (Leslie, 1987, 1988, 1994), theory change (Gopnik &amp; Wellman 1992), developing representational understanding (Perner, 1991, 1995, 2000), and experiential understanding developed in a socio-linguisitic context (Nelson, 1996). In addition, theory of mind has been linked to the development of symbolic understanding (Deloache &amp; Smith, 1999; Perner, 1991), pretend play (Leslie, 1987; Taylor &amp; Carlson, 1997; Youngblade &amp; Dunn, 1993), language (Astington &amp; Jenkins, 1999; Nelson, 1996; Olson, 1988) and executive function (e.g. Hughes, 1998a; Kochanska et al., 1996; Reed et al., 1984). The present study sought to bring together these diverse findings and to attempt to provide an integrated account of the emergence of theory of mind understanding during the preschool years. Sixty-four New Zealand children were assessed on their mental state understanding, deceptive abilities, symbolic functioning, language, and executive skills, when they were aged 30, 36, 42 and 48 months of age. 
 There were a number of key findings in the present study. Language was a powerful predictor of false belief performance both within and across time, and was also related to many of the other variables included in the study. Performance on the scale model test of symbolic functioning was related across time to children&#65533;s concurrent and later false belief understanding. Scale model performance was also intertwined in a bidirectional relationship with language, and language appeared to play an increasingly important role in mediating the relationship with false belief understanding across time. False belief understanding and scale model performance were also related within and across time to executive function. There was evidence to suggest that the importance of working memory was due to its role in conflict inhibition. Although deception has sometimes been posited to be a precocious manifestation of theory of mind (Chandler, Fritz, &amp; Hala, 1989), in the present study deceptive ability lagged false belief understanding. Furthermore, false belief understanding was related to children&#65533;s subsequent (but not earlier) responses to a protagonist&#65533;s intention. This supports the hypothesis that false belief understanding allows a qualitative change in the execution of deception, whereby children can move from simple physical strategies to more sophisticated mentalist strategies. Overall, the present study provides some evidence to suggest that symbolic functioning, language, and later theory of mind may form part of a single developing skill set of symbolic representation. In dynamic interaction with social understanding, and supported by cognitive abilities such as executive function, and the socio-linguistic context, it is argued that understanding of one&#65533;s own and other minds emerges. Children&#65533;s ability to solve the false belief problem at 4 years of age is presented as a milestone on a developmental continuum of social understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognition in children</field><field name="subject">thought and thinking</field><field name="subject">philosophy of mind</field><field name="subject">ethnopsychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061106.161621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENac) by ubiquitination</field><field name="creator">Wiemuth, Dominik</field><field name="description">The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the central component of the sodium absorption pathway in epithelia. It is critical for sodium homeostasis and blood pressure control, which is demonstrated by rare genetic disorders such as Liddle&#65533;s syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, that are associated with hyper- and hypotension, respectively. 
 ENaC is mainly regulated by mechanisms that control the expression of active channels at the cell surface. Ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4-like family, such as Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 decrease epithelial sodium absorption by binding to and targeting ENaC for endocytosis and degradation. This is most likely achieved by catalyzing the ubiquitination of ENaC. Conversely the serum- and glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) increases ENaC activity. This effect is partly mediated by the interaction of SGK with the ubiquitin ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. SGK is able to bind to both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2, however only Nedd4-2 is phosphorylated by SGK. The phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 inhibits its interaction with ENaC, thus reducing ENaC ubiquitination, thereby increasing surface expression and sodium absorption. 
 Nedd4-like proteins interact with ENaC via their WW-domains. These domains bind PY-motifs (PPXY) present in ENaC subunits. Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 both have four highly similar WW-domains. Previous studies have shown that interaction between Nedd4 and ENaC is mainly mediated by WW-domain 3. SGK also has a PY-motif; therefore it was analyzed whether the WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK. Here, it is shown that single or tandem WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mediate binding to SGK and that, despite their high similarity, different WW-domains of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are involved. These data also suggest that WW-domains 2 and 3 of Nedd4-2 mediate the interaction with SGK in a concerted manner, and that in vitro the phosphorylation of SGK at serine residue 422 increases its affinity for the WW-domains of Nedd4-2. 
 The stimulatory effect of SGK on ENaC activity is partly mediated via Nedd4-2 and will decrease if competition between Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 for binding to SGK occurs. Here it is shown that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are located in the same subcellular compartment and that they compete for binding to SGK. 
 Besides its function in the proteasomal degradation pathway ubiquitination is involved in the regulation of membrane protein trafficking, including their endocytosis. ENaC was shown previously to be ubiquitinated. Here, we provide evidence that ENaC can be ubiquitinated differentially depending on its cellular location. Channels residing in the plasma membrane are multiubiquitinated and we suggest that this serves as an internalization signal for ENaC and a control for further trafficking. Cytosolic ENaC is mainly polyubiquitinated, and therefore probably targeted for proteasomal degradation. However, mono- and multiubiquitination of ENaC located within the cytosol is very likely to occur as well. In addition, it is shown that both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways are involved in the regulation of ENaC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sodium channels</field><field name="subject">ubiquitin</field><field name="subject">blood pressure regulation</field><field name="subject">epithelium</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20061127.162243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in torsion theory</field><field name="creator">Charalambides, Stelios</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to generalize to the torsion-theoretic setting various concepts and results from the theory of rings and modules. In order to accomplish this we begin with some preliminaries which introduce the main ideas used in torsion theory, the major ones being [tau]-torsion and [tau]-torsionfree modules as well as [tau]-dense and [tau]-pure submodules. In the first chapter we also introduce a new concept, that of a [tau]-compact module, which is basic enough to deserve a place among the preliminaries. 
 The results that we obtain fall into three areas which are to a certain degree interrelated. The first area is on [tau]-Max modules, which we introduce as a torsion-theoretic analogue of Max modules. The main aim is to generalize a well-known result by Shock which characterizes Noetherian rings by using the socle, the radical and Max modules. All of these concepts have torsion-theoretic counterparts which we utilize in our generalization. Furthermore, we define and characterize left [tau]-Max rings and apply the torsion-theoretic version of Shock&#65533;s theorem to obtain a characterization of [tau]-short modules motivated by a recent article in which short modules were introduced. 
 The second area deals with various flavours of [tau]-injectivity, some known and some new. We introduce [tau]-M-injective and s-[tau]-M-injective modules and examine their relationship with the known concepts of [tau]-injective and [tau]-quasi-injective modules. We then provide an improved version of the Generalized Fuchs Criterion which characterizes s-[tau]-M-injective modules, and give a generalization of Azumaya&#65533;s Lemma. We also prove that every M-generated module has a [tau]-M-injective hull which is unique up to isomorphism and show how this is linked to the [tau]-quasi-injective hull. We then examine [Sigma]-[tau]-injectivity, generalizing well-known results by Faith, Albu and Na&#774;sta&#774;sescu and Cailleau which provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the [Sigma]-[tau]-injective property, the [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective property and for a direct sum of [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective modules to be [Sigma]-s-[tau]-M-injective. 
 In the third area we introduce a couple of new concepts with the aim of bringing to the torsion-theoretic setting the concept of a CS or extending module. The approach is twofold. The first is via [tau]-CS modules which serve as a generalization of CS modules as well as [tau]-quasi-continuous, [tau]-quasi-injective and [tau]-injective modules, and the second is via s-[tau]-CS modules which are a special case of CS modules. Our motivation is to provide a torsion-theoretic analogue of a well-known result by Okado which characterizes Noetherian modules. We have some partial results using s-[tau]-CS modules and a nice torsion-theoretic analogue, albeit without the use of [tau]-CS or s-[tau]-CS modules. We also examine the relationship between our relative versions of CS modules with those of other authors and obtain refinements to some of their results.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">torsion theory (algebra)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070216.161043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The One-China controversy, 1996-2002 : the impact of Taiwan&#65533;s democratisation on the cross-strait policies of Taipei, Beijing and Washington</field><field name="creator">Lin, Chin-sheng</field><field name="description">The one-China issue before the 1990s was not particularly complex as both sides of the Taiwan Strait claimed that there was only one China in the world and Taiwan was part of China. Nevertheless, after Taiwan accelerated democratisation in the early 1990s, and especially after 1996 when it entered a stage of democratic consolidation, the one-China issue has become a bitter controversy. 
 Taiwan was transformed from an authoritarian regime to a democracy through the revision of the constitution and the reform of elections for the Legislative Yu&#776;an and the presidency between 1991 and 1996. Democratisation not only legitimised the government&#65533;s rule on Taiwan, but also brought about Taiwanese nationalism, which forced the government to defend the sovereignty to which its democratic and economic achievements now entitled it. As the PRC has always claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, the one-China controversy has thus focused on Taiwan&#65533;s international status since the 1990s. In order to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence, the PRC adopted a carrot and stick strategy, but failed. Its "peaceful reunification" policy and the "one country, two systems" formula could not attract the Taiwanese, and its military threats were blocked by the US, which has strongly demanded a peaceful resolution for cross-Strait disputes since 1979. 
 As the US also needs the PRC&#65533;s cooperation in many international areas, it did not support Taiwan&#65533;s formal independence. Under such circumstances, maintaining the status quo of the Taiwan Strait becomes the best choice for the three sides. The one-China controversy is not expected to be resolved in the near future. 
 Democracy has been promoted as a universal value since the Cold War. As Taiwan has not ruled out the possibility of future democratic unification with the Mainland, the best way to resolve the one-China controversy might be the successful democratisation of the PRC, which the international community would welcome.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese reunification question (1949-)</field><field name="subject">democratization</field><field name="subject">foreign relations</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070220.142540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) in relation to oceanographic features</field><field name="creator">Clement, Deanna Marie</field><field name="description">Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) is an endangered coastal species endemic to New Zealand. Their distribution, like other marine organisms, is intertwined with the dynamics of their local habitats, and at a larger scale, the coastal waters around New Zealand. The main purpose of this thesis was to identify specific habitat requirements of this rare dolphin. 
 Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution around the South Island was quantified along several temporal and spatial scales. Large-scale density analyses of abundance surveys found over half of the South Island&#65533;s current population occurred within only three main regions. Two of these strongholds are along the west coast and the third is located around Banks Peninsula on the east coast. Smaller-scale analyses at Banks Peninsula found the majority of the dolphin community was preferentially using core regions within the marine mammal sanctuary. Monthly surveys showed that in summer and autumn statistically more dolphins occurred within inshore regions ([less than or equal to]one kilometre), spread throughout the surveyed coastline. From May through winter, dolphin densities rapidly declined. Remaining dolphins were significantly clumped in more offshore waters of eastern regions. The lowest encounter rates occurred between August and September. Certain 'hotspots' consistently had higher dolphin densities throughout the study period while others were preferred seasonally. 
 To address habitat preferences, surveys simultaneously collected oceanographic samples using a CTD profiler. In general, physical variables of the Peninsula&#65533;s eastern and southeastern waters varied less, despite being regularly exposed to upwellings and the varied presence of sub-tropical waters. Semi-sheltered bays and shallow inshore waters were highly variable and more susceptible to spatially discrete influences, such as localised river outflows and exchange events. Several hydrographic features were seasonally predictable due to their dependence on climate. The stratification and location of the two dominant water masses (neritic and sub-tropical) accounted for over half of the temporal and spatial variability observed in oceanographic data. 
 Possible relationships between oceanographic features and aggregations of dolphins within Banks Peninsula were examined using global regression and a spatial technique known as geographical weighted regression (GWR). GWR models out-performed corresponding global models, despite differences in degrees of freedom and increased model complexity. GWR results found relationships varied over localised scales that were concealed by global methods. Monthly GWR models suggested the seasonal presence and strength of local oceanographic fronts influenced dolphin distribution. Dolphin aggregations coincided with the steepest gradients between water masses along eastern regions of the Peninsula, and strong exchange events along the edges of the study area. 
 The continued survival of this endangered species is contingent on its protection. Long-term monitoring programmes are needed for the three main strongholds identified in this study. The occurrence of Hector&#65533;s dolphin 'hotspots' along frontal zones within Banks Peninsula also suggests alternative and increased protection strategies are needed for this sanctuary to be effective. In light of this thesis&#65533; findings and based on marine protection research, future sanctuaries need to consider why Hector&#65533;s dolphins are preferentially using particular regions and how their association with certain oceanographic features can help make informed decisions on more appropriate protected areas.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">dolphins</field><field name="subject">protection</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">West Coast</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula District</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070221.122411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic basis for the host-specific nitrogen fixation phenotype of Caucasian clover rhizobia</field><field name="creator">Miller, Simon Hugh</field><field name="description">Trifolium ambiguum (Caucasian clover) is being released in New Zealand for use in areas where growth of T. repens (white clover) is marginal. Although closely related to T. repens, T. ambiguum has unique and highly specific nodulation requirements and as rhizobial strains capable of effectively nodulating T. ambiguum are not naturally found in New Zealand soils, they must be introduced with the seed. Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strains such as ICC105 form effective nodules on T. ambiguum but ineffective (Fix&#8315;) nodules on T. repens. The T. repens nodules nevertheless develop normally and contain bacteroids. R. l. bv. trifolii strains that are effective on T. repens such as NZP561, fail to nodulate T. ambiguum. As the host-specific nitrogen fixation defect of Caucasian clover rhizobia on T. repens has potentially adverse agronomic implications, the genetic basis for this Fix&#8315; phenotype was investigated. 
 Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain ICC105 was converted to Fix&#8314; on T. repens by the introduction of an 18-kb fragment of DNA from a white clover rhizobial strain (NZP514) symbiotic plasmid. This fragment contained several nif and fix genes, including nifHDKEN, fixABCX, nifA, nifB, fdxN and fixU. Tn5 mutation of these white clover rhizobial genes demonstrated that most were required to impart the Fix&#8314; phenotype on T. repens to ICC105, with the exception of nifA. Mutagenesis of the ICC105 nifA gene and subsequent complementation with various combinations of the white clover rhizobia nif/fix genes as well as transcriptional lacZ fusion studies of the ICC105 nifA and nifH genes demonstrated that ICC105 nifA is expressed and functional during the ineffective nodulation of T. repens and able to activate expression of nifHDKEN and fixABCX operons derived from white clover rhizobium but not from ICC105. 
 Sequence analysis and comparison of the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed nif/fix operons revealed a conserved 111-bp region found between the nifH/fixA promoters of Caucasian clover rhizobia, but not in white clover rhizobia. Attempts to modify this region in ICC105 failed in creating a strain which was Fix&#8314; on T. repens; however recombination of the nifHD/fixAB region from a white clover rhizobium into the ICC105 genome produced several strains with a &#65533;swapped&#65533; nitrogen fixation phenotype (i.e. Fix&#8314; on T. repens and Fix&#8315; on T. ambiguum). A hypothesis was therefore proposed by which differences in the nifH/fixA promoter regions of Caucasian clover rhizobia and white clover rhizobia modulate the expression of the upstream genes in response to the particular plant host they are nodulating. 
 The incompatibility between the symbiotic plasmid of R. l. bv. trifolii ICC105 and the white clover rhizobium symbiotic plasmid cointegrate, pPN1, was also investigated and potential regions of each plasmid involved in this incompatibility were identified. 
 The research presented in this thesis has contributed to the genetic knowledge of the nitrogen fixation genes, and regulation of these genes in R. l. bv. trifolii. It has also provided progress towards the goal of creating a suitable inoculant strain for T. ambiguum that is able to fix nitrogen in symbiosis with both T. repens and T. ambiguum.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen-fixing plants</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">clover</field><field name="subject">Rhizobium leguminosarum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070306.155157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The composition and interactions of catalytic surfaces in working environments</field><field name="creator">Warren, David Stephen</field><field name="description">In order to clarify the role that water plays in the photocatalytic process, changes in the IR and Raman spectra of P25 TiO&#8322; thin films were observed upon exposure to liquid water. Further investigation of these spectral changes via dehydration of thin films under nitrogen and oxygen of different humidities led to the observation of spectroscopic features that have been assigned to localised surface phonon modes. When the effect of UV irradiation on these features was investigated, a broad IR absorption due to transitions of electrons in shallow traps was detected under dry nitrogen but not under dry oxygen. 
 Further investigation of the photocatalytic properties of P25 TiO&#8322; showed a complete removal of a stearic acid film. The final products have been tentatively assigned to a mixture of short chain carbonyl species and adsorbed carbonates as well as carbon dioxide and water. 
 The IR spectrum of the fuel cell membrane material Nafion is complex and literature data varies in some of the assignments. The compound perfluoro(2-ethoxyethane)sulfonic acid was used as a model compound for the Nafion side chain resulting in a clearer assignment of the Nafion IR spectrum. In light of these new assignments changes induced in the region 1100-1300 cm&#8315;&#65533; by variation in humidity and ion exchange have been shown to be mainly the result of changes in the sulfonate asymmetric stretching modes. 
 By flowing a series of solutions containing tetramethylammonium ions and perchlorate ions the surface charge characteristics of a Pt black film were determined in the pH range 2-12. There proved to be a weak positive charge below pH 4 and a weak negative charge above pH 9. Between these points there appeared to be no overall charge on the surface. 
 When perfluoro(2-ethoxyethane)sulfonic acid was adsorbed to a Pt black film changes in its IR spectrum indicated a strong binding via interactions between the sulfonate groups and the Pt surface. The nature of the adsorption of Nafion was less clear cut and, whilst adsorption is strong, it seems possible that hydrophobic interactions between the Nafion backbone and the surface are involved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalysis</field><field name="subject">metallic oxides</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">surface chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070312.133709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Requirements for splicing by Cne PRP8, a novel intein from cryptococcus neoformans</field><field name="creator">Pearl, Esther</field><field name="description">Inteins are autocatalytic protein domains that splice out of the nascent polypeptide shortly after translation, requiring no co-factors to facilitate splicing. There is an intein coding sequence within the Prp8 gene of Cryptococcus neoformans, a human pathogen that causes cryptococcosis in immunocompromised people. The intein, Cne PRP8, is a drug target as Prp8 is a central component of the spliceosome and thus believed to be essential to the fungus. Improved knowledge of the intein and its requirements for splicing can contribute to design of a screening system and the search for an inhibitor of intein splicing. 
 Purification of Cne PRP8 for crystallisation was performed using either an N- or a C-terminal His&#65533;Tag&#65533;, where the N-terminal His&#65533;Tag&#65533; was removed by 3C protease prior to crystallisation trials. C-terminally His&#65533;Tagged&#65533; Cne PRP8 formed the largest crystals. The crystals were triangular plates with stepped faces. A 2.8 A&#778; data set was collected with an R[merge] of 0.151 and a mosaicity of 2.1&#65533;. A smaller crystal gave a 3.6 A&#778; data set with an R[merge] of 0.085 and a mosaicity of 1.5&#65533;. Molecular replacement was not sufficient to solve the structure, likely because the data were weak and the molecules in the asymmetric unit too numerous. Purified Cne PRP8 was additionally shown by circular dichroism to lack regular secondary structure, suggesting that regions of Cne PRP8 could be natively unstructured. 
 Cne PRP8 was expressed as a fusion protein between Haemophilus influenzae trigger factor (HiTF) and a chitin binding domain (CBD). Antibodies to the different parts of the fusion protein facilitated the observation of splicing ability by western blotting. From this it was determined that Cne PRP8 is capable of splicing in a foreign protein context. Context is important, with maximum splicing occurring when Cne PRP8 has two native N-terminal extein residues and one native C-terminal extein residue. The first residue and the last two residues of Cne PRP8 are essential for splicing; additionally the conserved threonine (T62) and histidine (H65) were shown to be catalytically important. Also required for splicing are arginine 154, tyrosine 162, and aspartate 166. Leucine 161 undergoes ~50% splicing when mutated to alanine, and tryptophan 151 undergoes limited C-terminal cleavage, but no splicing, when mutated to alanine. Tryptophan 151 was identified as a potentially crucial residue, which may function to prevent C-terminal cleavage before the N-terminal rearrangements have taken place. Overall it appears that Cne PRP8 residues that are more diverged from the general intein consensus are less essential for splicing. 
 Wild type Cne PRP8 is insensitive to zinc inhibition in vivo. It is also unresponsive to cadmium, calcium, cobalt, lithium, magnesium, manganese and nickel. However, a partially splicing-deficient mutant exhibited further inhibition in response to zinc and cadmium. This mutant also showed a limited increase in splicing efficiency in response to temperatures lower than 37&#65533;C. 
 This study has identified critical residues, in addition to those at the splice junctions necessary for catalysis, which participate in splicing intermediates.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryptococcus neoformans</field><field name="subject">genetic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.145703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the dental therapist in New Zealand's public health system</field><field name="creator">Tane, Helen Rose</field><field name="description">This study examines aspects of how dental therapy began and developed, since it was introduced as one of the first public health occupations in New Zealand, in 1921. Dental therapy began as dental nursing, and was introduced by visionary dentists in order to treat widespread dental disease within the New Zealand population. The occupation gained international recognition. Dental nurses performed their tasks under the direct supervision and direction of a public health dentist and the occupation was restricted to females and child-patients.
	Investigating issues that have influenced the development of dental therapy is critical in today&#65533;s climate. Background research in the thesis reveals an interplay of issues relating to gender, professional development and measures of how successful the occupation has been in relation to oral health need. The latter is particularly questionable for our indigenous people in New Zealand. How has the role of the dental therapist in New Zealand been utilised? Has the delivery of care been based on sound knowledge and dental need? Has the role progressed in order to provide effective and appropriate care within a publicly funded system? These issues are important issues, particularly when New Zealand&#65533;s dental therapy profession becomes one of the many health professions that will be affected by the new Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act when it is implented over the following year.
	In order to improve oral health for the population, it is vital that the dental therapist is appropriately and effectively utilised. How oral health workers perceive the past role and future role in achieving oral health gain is investigated in this study by using interviews and postal surveys, and the results are discussed.
	The findings show that the dental therapist has not always been utilised and developed using sound epidemiological evidence. Elements of professional protection by the dental profession coupled with depleted health funding rather than dental need have appeared as driving factors. Furthermore, the dental therapy profession has remained in a sub-ordinate role to the dental profession. The findings of this study show that a large number of the current dental therapy workforce do not feel that they are ready to provide dental care autonomously.
	Information in the thesis argues that past legislation and subordination to the dental profession has largely affected the development of dental therapy, and whether this has always assisted in improving oral health for the New Zealand population is questioned in this work. With a depleted number in the workforce, the role has become focussed on a reparative form of care, not one that promotes and improves oral health. This is not acceptable in a publicly funded system.
	Implementing changes to the dental therapy role must be undertaken, but undertaken with caution and based on progressive health-promoting ideology.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental assistants</field><field name="subject">dental hygienists</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">dental care</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070507.114703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of polaron, bipolaron and exciton structures in oligothiophenes : a resonance raman and theoretical study</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Tracey Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a spectroscopic and computational study of a variety of substituted oligothiophenes. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the structural properties of their neutral, oxidised and excited states. This was accomplished using a number of spectroscopic methods, including electronic absorption, resonance Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Analysis of the data provided by these methods was aided by the application of density functional theory (DFT) to the neutral and charged species, allowing conclusions regarding bond length changes and molecular orbitals to be drawn. Advancing the understanding of the structural properties of conductive materials such as oligothiophenes is important due to their potential application in plastic electronic devices (organic solar cells, field effect transistors and light emitting diodes, for instance) and the need to clarify the charge transport mechanism. 
 The compounds examined in this thesis are primarily based on 3&#65533; styryl-substituted terthiophene. Substituted derivatives of this molecule include those with groups on the para position of the phenyl ring or methyl &#945;,&#945;&#65533; end caps. Larger ethenyl-aryl groups were also investigated, as were analogous thiophenes and sexithiophenes. Indeed, the 3&#65533;-substituted sexithiophenes formed an integral part of this investigation since they rapidly form in the head-to-head orientation from the oxidation and consequent [sigma]-dimerisation of the substituted terthiophenes. 
 DFT calculations on the sexithiophene charged species have indicated the presence of a full polaronic or bipolaronic structural defect in the centre of the thiophene backbone, as defined by the reversal of the CC bond length alternation to create a domain of quinoidal bond sequence. However, the structural defect of the styryl sexithiophenes is more strongly localised than that observed for unsubstituted sexithiophene; indeed, the charged defect appears to be confined by the positions of the styryl substituents. This defect confinement along the thiophene backbone is particularly apparent in the styryl sexithiophene dications. 
 Electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy have been applied to the oxidation products of the styryl terthiophenes. Only sexithiophene charged species are observed when the &#945; termini are unsubstituted; these include sexithiophene radical cations, [pi]-dimers (a stabilising face-to-face interaction between two radical cations) and dications. The resonance Raman spectra of these charged species are characterised by a very intense symmetrical CC stretching mode of the thiophene inter-ring bonds, which is also evident in the theoretical spectra. The extensive differences between the styryl and unsubstituted sexithiophene dication Raman spectra have been attributed to defect confinement: the strongest Raman band of the unsubstituted sexithiophene dication is due to a vibrational mode localised over the entire sexithiophene backbone while that of the styryl sexithiophenes is localised over the central two thiophene rings - the same area occupied by the confined defect. 
 A combined steady-state and picosecond time-resolved emission study on the styryl terthiophenes revealed that by judicious choice of the para R group in styryl terthiophenes it is possible to tune the nature of the first excited singlet state from [pi],[pi]* to charge transfer character. Charge transfer states may offer possible strategies for solar cells in which charge separation is a key step.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oligomers</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070420.150451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lasting neuroprotection with clomethiazole following hypoxia-ischaemia-induced neurodegeneration : a mechanistic study</field><field name="creator">Clarkson, Andrew N.</field><field name="description">Subsequent to an hypoxic-ischaemic (HI)-insult a multi-faceted complex cascade of events occurs that ultimately results in cellular and neurological impairments within cortical and sub-cortical central nervous system (CNS) regions. In the present studies a modified &#65533;Levine&#65533; rat-pup model of HI (left carotid artery ligation + 1 hour global hypoxia on post-natal day (PND) 26) was employed to assess the neuroprotective properties of clomethiazole (CMZ; a &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor agonist). In this study, histological and electrophysiological paradigms were used to assess the long-term neuroprotective properties of CMZ (414mg/kg/day via mini-pumps). Key enzymes involved in inflammation, namely nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase, were also examined to assess other potential CMZ mechanisms. Assessments were carried out 3- and 90-days post-HI, with extensive ipsilateral CNS lesions evident at a gross histological level, at both the early and long-term stages, with CMZ significantly decreasing the lesion size at 3- and 90-days (P&lt;0.01; P&lt;0.05). Evoked field potential analyses were used to assess hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity ex vivo. Electrophysiological measurements contralateral to the occlusion revealed impaired neuronal function following HI relative to short- and long-term controls (P&lt;0.001, 3- and 14-days; P&lt;0.01, 90-days), with CMZ providing near complete protection (P&lt;0.001 at 3- and 14-days; P&lt;0.01 at 90-days). Both inducible NOS (iNOS) and arginase activities were significantly increased at 3-days (P&lt;0.01), with arginase activity remaining elevated at 90-days post-HI (P&lt;0.05) ipsilaterally. CMZ suppressed the HI-induced increase in iNOS and arginase activities (P&lt;0.001; P&lt;0.05). These data provide evidence of long-term functional neuroprotection afforded by CMZ in a model of HI-induced neurodegeneration. In addition, under conditions of HI, functional deficits were not restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere and were due, at least in part, to changes in the activity of NOS and arginase. 
 Underlying mitochondrial dysfunction is eminently present in many neuropathological conditions. The full extent of mitochondrial dysfunction in cortical, hippocampal and cerebellar tissues was assessed following HI. Assessment of mitochondrial FAD-linked respiration at both 1- and 3-days post-HI revealed a significant decrease in activity from ipsilateral cortical and hippocampal regions (P&lt;0.001). In addition, significant changes in respiratory function were also evident in contralateral regions and cerebellum, 3-days post-HI (P&lt;0.05). Assessment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (complexes I-V) and mitochondrial markers of integrity (citrate synthase) and oxidative stress (aconitase) confirmed ipsilateral mitochondrial impairment following HI. Complexes I, II-III, V and citrate synthase were also impaired, in contralateral regions and cerebellum, 3-days post-HI. CMZ treatment provided significant protection to all mitochondrial aspects of neuronal tissue assessed. This study provides evidence of the full extent of mitochondrial damage following an HI-insult and may contribute, in part, to the impairment seen contralaterally. In addition, protection afforded by CMZ extends to preservation of mitochondrial function and integrity. 
 Cerebral ischaemia-induced angiogenesis has been shown within and around infarcted regions and may contribute to a more favourable neurological outcome. The level of angiogenesis was examined using platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1 / CD31). CD31 immunolabelling 7-days post-HI revealed a significant increase in angiogenesis compared with non-intervention controls (P&lt;0.001). Treatment with CMZ decreased the level of angiogenesis compared to HI + saline (P&lt;0.001) back to non-intervention control levels. Conversely, N[omega]-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) treatment (5mg/kg/day) exacerbated the ischaemic lesion (P&lt;0.001) and resulted in a marked decrease in angiogenesis compared to non-intervention controls (P&lt;0.001). The extent of cerebral infarction in these studies is dependent on the level of NOS activity with CMZ increasing total NOS levels compared to HI + saline, while L-NAME halted the HI-induce increase in total NOS activity (P&lt;0.001). These results show for the first time, that angiogenesis may be used as an assessment of neurodegeneration / neuroprotection in pathologies of cerebral ischaemia and are directly correlated with changes in NOS activity. 
 These studies have therefore shown that following HI, damage also occurs contralateral to the occlusion, and is not restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of CMZ have been shown to extend out to 90-days post-HI, whereby significant protection to CA1 neuronal activity was seen. These studies also provide in vivo evidence that CMZ may also afford neuroprotection via anti-inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by a decrease in iNOS and arginase activities. Furthermore, these studies have also show evidence that angiogenesis (CD31) can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess neuroprotection / neurodegeneration.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clomethiazole</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="subject">anoxemia</field><field name="subject">cerebral ischemia</field><field name="subject">neuroprotective agents</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070424.120005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geology of central southern Fiordland : with emphasis on the cause of polybaric Cretaceous metamorphism in western New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Powell, Nicholas Garth</field><field name="description">Central southern Fiordland, New Zealand, is underlain extensively by metasediments and associated metavolcanics. These are mapped in three lithostratigraphic units, from west to east Edgecumbe Group, Cameron Group and Cumbrae Supergroup. Lower Cameron Group units lithocorrelate with Central Fiordland Belt lithological associations and with those of Fraser Complex, Westland. 
 Eastern Fiordland Belt metavolcanics and lacustrine metasediments are tectonostratigraphically unrelated to Cameron Group, from which they are separated by the Grebe Fault. They instead have affiliations with the Loch Burn Formation, Largs Volcanics, Drumduan Group and Paterson Group. These units (collectively, "Cumbrae Supergroup") represent remnants of a Triassic-Jurassic calc-alkaline arc. 
 Six deformational episodes are identified in central southern Fiordland. The earliest, D&#8321;, is obliterated by D&#8322; and M&#8322; metamorphism. D&#8323; is restricted to the Southwest Fiordland Block. D&#8324; occupied a brief interval of M&#8323; time. D&#8324; of the Central and Western Fiordland Belts corresponds to earliest deformation in Eastern Fiordland Belt metavolcanics. The Grebe Fault is a left-lateral reverse D&#8324; fault; now vertical, it previously dipped eastward. The Dusky Fault, a reactivated D&#8325; left-lateral transfer structure, accommodated the dip-slip component of displacement at low-angle normal faults during mid-Cretaceous extension. Open folds represent D&#8326;. Post-glacial scarps mark the post-D&#8326; Kilcoy and Vincent Faults. Their merged northward continuation is intersected by the tailrace tunnel of the Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station. 
 Southwest Fiordland Block pelites were metamorphosed at 665 &#65533;C, c. 3 kbar during M&#8322;. Early M&#8323; is of contact metamorphic aspect. Late M&#8323; is distinctively polybaric: Central Fiordland Belt kyanite-garnet pelites recrystallised at c. 8.5 kbar after metamorphism in the sillimanite field at c. 3.5 kbar. Western Fiordland Orthogneiss 12 kbar granulite assemblages formed during late M&#8323;. South of the Dusky Fault, late M&#8323; is almost asymptomatic. The M&#8323; field gradient is continuous across the Grebe Fault: in the Eastern Fiordland Belt, late M&#8323; staurolite and garnet supersede chloritoid in lacustrine (meta-)sapropel-silts. 
 The Grebe Fault is an important tectonostratigraphic break; it may separate New Zealand&#65533;s Western and Eastern Provinces. Its relationship to any "Median Tectonic Zone" is unclear, as no such zone has been found in southeastern Fiordland. Cumbrae Supergroup rocks within the "Median Tectonic Zone" represent the arc that nourished the Eastern Province&#65533;s Barretts Formation, Murihiku Supergroup and Stephens Subgroup. The Cumbrae arc was &#65533;obducted&#65533; westwards during Early Cretaceous continent-arc collision. This event simultaneously halted Eastern Province volcanogenic sedimentation and tectonically buried Fiordland, imposing late M&#8323; pressure increments. Drumduan Group lawsonite is coeval. 
 Cretaceous collision induced glaciation. Late Cretaceous climatic deterioration and extensional tectonism caused icecap development. The Otago "Peneplain" is a Late Cretaceous subglacial floor. Accumulation of voluminous perennial Cretaceous ice on Earth has hitherto not been inferred. 
 Facultative psychrophily in New Zealand&#65533;s ancient endemics and their preference for dark conditions reflect passage through a hitherto-unsuspected evolutionary bottleneck: prolonged winter darkness and harsh climate of near-polar Late Cretaceous New Zealand exerted extraordinary evolutive pressures on ancestral forms after biotic links with Gondwana were severed.

A study of a convenience sample of 40 families with children (58 adults and 92 children) whose sole income was a government welfare benefit was undertaken. Two-thirds of these households regularly relied on a limited variety of food; one-half did not have a sufficient amount of food because of lack of money and outstanding debts. Over the previous year two-thirds had sourced food from a food bank and one-third had been gifted food from friends or relatives. Women&#65533;s intakes were compromised regularly but not children&#65533;s. All of the women experienced worry about feeding their household. One-fifth were overweight and over 40% obese despite low reported daily energy intakes (median (SE) 5.7 (0.5) MJ) compared to national data. Six repeated 24-hour diet recalls collected randomly over a two-week period enabled calculation of usual daily intake and the prevalence of inadequate intake for eight micronutrients which were disturbingly high. The children&#65533;s growth patterns compared favourably with US population percentiles. 
 The National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) allowed the adaption of eight questions--developed by Reid using qualitative methods--to eight indicator statements about food security to be addressed by each participant on behalf of them or their household. Prevalence was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) for females compared to males for the majority of indicator statements among New Zealand European and Others (NZEO) and Maori. NZEO reported the most food security; Pacific people reported the least and Maori fell between the two. There was a significant increasing linear trend of food security with age (p&lt;0.001) after adjusting for gender. 
 Rasch analysis was performed on 1868 households where participants reported some food insecurity. The responses were ranked according to the proportion and ordering of their positive responses to eight indices of food security, achieving reliability (Cronbach&#65533;s Alpha) close to the conventionally accepted level of 0.7. The eight indices were ranked on the same scale; the minimum score -1.66 was achieved by the index &#65533;use special food grants/banks&#65533; (the index least reported and most severe) and the maximum score 1.86 was achieved by the index &#65533;variety of foods eaten limited&#65533; (the index most reported and least severe). 
 Categories of food security were assigned using scale cut points: &#65533;fully/almost fully food secure&#65533;; &#65533;moderate food security&#65533;; &#65533;low food security&#65533;. Category status was associated with consumption of recommended number of daily serves of fruit, vegetables, fruits and vegetables, consumption of leaner meats, fatty meats and daily serves of bread. By ANOVA and controlling for sex, ethnicity, Index of Deprivation, urban/rural location, age, level of education, income, and household size, category of household food security was associated with the level of daily intake of total fat, saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, glucose, fructose, lactose, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin C. Dietary data were from the primary 24-hour diet recall of respondents. Participants in the fully/almost fully food secure category of households had a mean BMI of 28.7 compared to those moderately secure (29.2) and of low food security (29.5) (p=0.015 for difference among categories). 
 In the Children&#65533;s Nutrition Survey 2002 (CNS02) data set, the same eight indices were used and food insecurity was experienced significantly more often by children in the largest households, those in the most deprived areas of residence (NZDep01 Quintile) and those of Pacific and Maori ethnicity compared to NZEO children. Rasch analysis was performed on responses for 1561 households with children which reported some food insecurity. Subject reliability was close to 0.7 (the conventionally acceptable level). The distribution of the eight indices on the Rasch scale was similar to that observed among the NNS97 households and almost identical to the sub-set of households with children, from that dataset. Categories of food security status were assigned as in the NN5S97 and they predicted daily nutrient intake levels of children: total sugars, lactose, vitamm A, &#946;-carotene, vitamin B12 and calcium. A more rigorous assigning of categories at the low/moderate scale cut-off, resulted in a further association with level of intake of glucose, fructose and folate. Mean BMI across categories of food security did not differ. 
 Collectively these data provide unequivocal evidence that food insecurity exists in New Zealand, that it can be quantified and associated with nutrition outcomes. It has a negative impact on the nutrient intakes of both adults and children and a negative impact on the body weight status of adults. 
 These data have implications for nutrition and health professionals and policy makers in New Zealand. They also add to the world-wide body of knowledge of the experience of, and the measurement and predictive potential of food security in populations where the food supply appears plentiful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">low-income consumers</field><field name="subject">poor</field><field name="subject">household surveys</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070426.162526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-mortem personalisation : an ethnographic study of funeral directors in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Schafer, Cyril Timo</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the personalisation of Pakeha (European) post-mortem practices in New Zealand. While much of the discourse surrounding funerary and disposal processes maintains that contemporary practices demonstrate a &#65533;denial&#65533; of death and funeral director esurience, funeral directors themselves have argued that the austere Anglophone approach to death has been superseded by personalised practices. This transformation has become particularly evident in the last two decades and emphasises a historic shift to funeral services that encompass the heterogeneity of late-modern individuals. The aim of this thesis, however, is not to recapitulate funeral director rhetoric or reiterate the criticisms levelled at the industry, but to critically examine the implications and manifestations of personalisation, and explore the funeral directors&#65533; role in the provision of contemporary funeral services. In addition to archival research, this ethnographic endeavour includes in-depth interviews with funeral directors (and related occupational groups) and an extended period of participant observation. The theoretical issues explored in this thesis are grounded in this ethnographic data. 
 This study reveals that personalisation is integrally linked to constructions of grief, the pastoral role of funeral directors, and Foucault&#65533;s concept of bio-power. Funeral director participants asseverated that funeral practices had &#65533;evolved&#65533; to effect the &#65533;healthy&#65533; resolution of grief. Personalised funerals represented a re-alignment of &#65533;natural&#65533; human needs and cultural practices, and funeral director rhetoric amalgamated essentialist interpretations of grief with personalised memories and continuing bonds (Klass and Walter 2001). Funeral directors explicitly linked personalisation to secularisation, emphasising the perceived lack of &#65533;guidance&#65533; and &#65533;care&#65533; in contemporary society. Although &#65533;impersonal&#65533; religious funerals provided funeral specialists with an important point of departure, many funeral directors emphasised the pastoral dimension of contemporary funeral directing. This dimension constitutes a key component of the funeral directors&#65533; role and permeated all facets of funeral service - particularly the increasing range of after-care funeral options. 
 Although the funeral director rhetoric emphasises the democratisation of funeral practices and the primacy of individuality, an examination of the discourse reveals that this personalisation also demonstrates the normalising technologies integral to Foucault&#65533;s concept of &#65533;pastoral power&#65533;. I argue that funeral directors play a significant role in articulating the boundaries of &#65533;appropriate&#65533; funeral behaviour by accentuating the importance of &#65533;authenticity&#65533;, &#65533;dignity&#65533; and &#65533;healthy grief&#65533;. These concepts underline the expertise of funeral directors, define the acceptable parameters of post-mortem practices, and reify the integral involvement of funeral directors in the construction process. The specific subjectivity promoted by funeral directors constitute individuals that are not only &#65533;honest&#65533; and &#65533;real&#65533;, but recognise the &#65533;need&#65533; for a funeral service, emotional expression, and memorialisation. These individuals similarly realise the importance of integrating the deceased into their own biographies, while acknowledging the significance of guidance and control. This subjectivity clearly legitimises the role of the contemporary New Zealand funeral director. This thesis illustrates, therefore, that funeral directors play a salient role in articulating bio-power within New Zealand society, and that this endeavour is integrally linked to the occupations&#65533; continuing pursuit of professional identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">undertakers and undertaking</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">funeral rites and ceremonies</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.115528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#65533;The danger of vertigo&#65533; : an evaluation and critique of Theosis in the theology of Thomas Forsyth Torrance</field><field name="creator">Habets, Michael</field><field name="description">The Christian tradition, both East and West, has developed various models and theories of the atonement as explanations of what it means to speak of the reconciling activity of God in Christ. Central to these has been the claim that God has reconciled the world to himself in Christ. One way of testifying to the reconciling love of God has been the adoption of the metaphor theosis (&#65533;divinization&#65533;, &#65533;deification&#65533;) as an explanation of salvation. While central to Eastern Orthodoxy, a doctrine of theosis also has a rich tradition within Western, especially Reformed theology. The Reformed theologian, Thomas Forsyth Torrance, represents an attempt to construct a soteriology that incorporates both Eastern and Western models of the atonement around the controlling metaphor of theosis. A close reading of his theology presents a robust and clearly articulated doctrine of theosis as a key way of expressing God&#65533;s reconciling activity in Christ. As the true Man and the last Adam, Christ represents the arche and telos of human existence, the one in whose image all humanity has been created and into whose likeness all humanity is destined to be transformed from glory to glory. Through the Incarnation the Son becomes human without ceasing to be divine, to unite humanity and divinity together and effect a &#65533;deification&#65533; of human nature, mediated to men and women who are said to be &#65533;in Christ&#65533; by the work of the Holy Spirit. By means of a &#65533;wonderful exchange&#65533; Christ takes what is ours and gives us what is his. For Torrance, this is the heart of atonement. The goal of humanity is worship, something Torrance defines as the gift of participating through the Spirit in the incarnate Son&#65533;s communion with the Father. The locus of worship, and thus of theosis, is the church, the communion of saints created by the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Throughout Torrance&#65533;s doctrines of creation, anthropology, incarnation, reconciliation, and pneumato-ecclesiology, the concept of theosis plays a central and constitutive role in explaining a Christian theology of salvation. Theosis is thus foundational to Torrance&#65533;s theology and is one way in which he holds together in systematic fashion his diverse theological oeuvre.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thomas Forsyth Torrance (1913-)</field><field name="subject">doctrinal theology</field><field name="subject">deification</field><field name="subject">atonement</field><field name="subject">salvation</field><field name="subject">Christianity</field><field name="subject">History of Doctrines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.120857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope tracers of landfill leachate impacts on aquatic systems</field><field name="creator">North, Jessica C.</field><field name="description">The present study aimed to determine whether stable isotope techniques can be universally applied to detect landfill leachate contamination in aquatic systems. Results of analysis of &#65533;&#65533;C in dissolved inorganic carbon ([delta]&#65533;&#65533;C-DIC), deuterium and &#65533;&#8312;O in water ([delta]D-H&#8322;O and [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O-H&#8322;O), and &#65533;&#8309;N of dissolved inorganic nitrogen components ([delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NH&#8324;&#8314; and [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NO&#8323;&#8315;) were presented for leachate, surface, and ground water samples collected from seven landfills located throughout New Zealand between 2003 and 2006. The unique conditions within a landfill lead to measurable fractionations in the isotopic ratios of the products of degradation. Results of isotope and ancillary parameter analyses enabled the discernment of different types of leachate, resulting from different microbial processes within the landfill environment. The isotopic characterisation of leachate enabled improved interpretation of geochemical data from potentially impacted surface and ground waters, and provides useful insight to landfill development for landfill operators. A general isotopic fingerprint delineated by [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C-DIC and [delta]D-H&#8322;O values showed leachate to be isotopically distinct from uncontaminated surface and ground water for samples analysed in the present study. However, not all water samples identified as leachate-impacted via site-specific assessments exhibited isotopic values that overlapped with the general leachate fingerprint. This highlights the need to investigate each site individually, within the context of a possibly global leachate isotope signature. Site-specific investigations revealed the effectiveness of applying [delta]&#65533;&#8312;O-H&#8322;O and [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NH&#8324;&#8314; or [delta]&#65533;&#8309;N-NO&#8323;&#8315;, in addition to [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C-DIC and [delta]D-H&#8322;O analyses, to the detection of leachate impact on aquatic systems. Furthermore, ancillary parameters such as alkalinity and ammonium concentration enabled the construction of simple isotope mixing models for an estimate of the quantity of leachate contribution. Results of isotopic investigations of stream biota suggested potential for the development of bio-indicators to monitor leachate influence on aquatic ecosystems in landfill-associated streams. The present study demonstrated the probative power of stable isotope techniques applied to investigations of leachate impact on landfill-associated aquatic systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotope tracers</field><field name="subject">fills (earthwork)</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070504.144317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro and In vivo investigations of tolerance induction and the role of G-protein coupled kainate receptors</field><field name="creator">Hesp, Blair</field><field name="description">The excitotoxin domoic acid (DOM) acts at both kainic acid (KA)- and &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptors. Clinical reports suggest that elderly people are hypersensitive to the neurological effects of DOM intoxication. Young, but not aged hippocampal slices which have been preconditioned with low concentrations of DOM or KA exhibit an acute &#65533;tolerance&#65533; to subsequent high doses of DOM or KA; application of the selective AMPA agonist fluorowillardiine (FW) fails to induce tolerance to excitotoxins. The aim of this study was to further investigate the molecular mechanism of tolerance induction in vitro, and to examine the ability of compounds to cross-condition against excitotoxic insult. In addition, in vivo techniques were used to explore the age-related susceptibility to the neurological effects of DOM and acute in vivo tolerance induction. Here we show that low doses of &#65533;classical&#65533; ionotropic kainate receptor agonists and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists act as net inverse agonists at G-protein coupled receptors, reducing constitutive GTPase activity by up to 73% in the young hippocampus. Further evidence that inverse agonist activity at G-protein coupled receptors is responsible for acute in vitro tolerance induction by kainate receptor agonists and antagonists was also identified because preconditioning with the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-52466 significantly inhibited KA-induced population spike suppression in in vitro hippocampal brain slices from both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. The broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor H-7 partially blocked tolerance induction when preconditioning occurs in the presence of suggesting that protein kinases are one of the downstream effectors of this phenomenon. Tolerance-inducing compounds are also capable of cross-conditioning against the effects of other excitotoxins; with 250 nM FW suppressed population spike area by only 62.8 &#65533; 10.0% at 30 minutes following a 500 nM KA preconditioning dose, compared to almost complete spike suppression within twenty minutes in naive hippocampal brain slices. In vivo experiments indicated that despite aged animals exhibiting significantly higher cumulative behavioural scores in response to i.p. DOM (1 mg kg&#8315;&#65533;; young = 102 &#65533; 9, aged = 179 &#65533; 19; P &lt; 0.01) in response to DOM after two hours), and that this age-related supersensitivity is due to impaired renal clearance (young serum DOM = 41.5 &#65533; 30.3 ng ml&#8315;&#65533;, aged = 813.3 &#65533; 804.4 ng ml&#8315;&#65533; following administration of 1 mg kg&#8315;&#65533; DOM after 2.5 hours earlier). Tolerance to high doses of DOM was induced within a matter of minutes following i.p. preconditioning by low dose DOM in vivo. This was evidenced by severe seizure manifestations being almost absent in both young and aged animals, despite occurring frequently in naive animals. Therefore, this study concludes that tolerance is induced by kainate receptor ligands in vitro and in vivo within a matter of minutes, and is the result of a reduction in the turnover of G-protein coupled receptors and protein kinase activation. In addition, the increased sensitivity of aged rats to in vivo DOM is a result of elevated serum DOM concentrations most likely resulting from impaired renal clearance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">G proteins</field><field name="subject">domoic acid</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.150053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation approaches to minimise injection site reactions of poorly soluble drugs</field><field name="creator">Wu, Zimei</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of formulation approaches to minimise injection site reactions for poorly soluble drugs. The specific objectives were to modify the injection site reactions by identification of irritant components in the formulation and control of their release kinetics; and to gain understanding of formulation approaches to create a favourable microenvironment in the tissues allowing better tissue tolerance and drug absorption. 
 Methods: Physicochemical properties of the model drug, ricobendazole (RBZ) were characterised using conventional methods. Three formulation approaches to minimise irritancy of the low pH RBZ solution were assessed. An in vitro method using 96-well microplates and a microtiter plate reader was used for detection of drug precipitation on dilution for formulation characterisation. Cellular damage by the formulations was investigated in L929 fibroblasts using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Tissue tolerance and pharmacokinetics were simultaneously investigated after subcutaneous injection in sheep. A low pH RBZ solution was used as a reference formulation. 
 Results: Preformulation studies showed that RBZ was practically insoluble in water and oils, and was slightly soluble in commonly used co-solvents. Solubility was slightly improved by complexation with hydroxypropyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin (HP-&#946;-CD, K&#8321;:&#8321; = 311 M&#8315;&#65533;) or a combination of low pH (&gt; 2) with surfactants or co-solvents. A U-shaped pH-solubility profile in aqueous solutions indicated that RBZ is an ampholyte. pKa values measured by absorbance spectroscopy and pH solubility methods were 3.45 and 3.76 (basic) and 9.82 and 9.53 (acidic) respectively. The partition coefficient was 14.3 - 15.2 at pH 6 - 9 and less at higher or lower pH. In aqueous solutions, RBZ showed a V-shaped pH-degradation rate profile and was most stable at pH 4.8. Degradation pathways were identified as hydrolysis and oxidation. 
 Three RBZ injectables (5%) were obtained by modification of the low pH RBZ solution; addition of 20% HP-&#946;-CD, incorporation into a w/o emulsion, and a microemulsion (ME). On dilution with SPB, the onset time of drug precipitation was prolonged and the rate was reduced in the presence of HP-&#946;-CD. The w/o emulsion had a low viscosity (&lt; 60 mPa.s) and exhibited Newtonian flow. Drug release versus the square root of time was linear and the release rate could be adjusted by phase ratio and droplet size. Drug release was found to be by diffusion. A coarse emulsion layer appeared at the interface between the ME and buffer. Drug release from the ME was faster than from the emulsion and was linear with the square root of time. On titration into SPB, the three formulations showed controlling effects on the release of H&#8323;O&#8314; compared to the reference formulation. RBZ (0.1 mg/ml) was more toxic to L929 cells than the co-solvent propylene glycol (50 mg/ml). The formulations showed greater cytotoxicity than their vehicles in the order: ME &gt; RBZ solution = emulsion &gt; HP-&#946;-CD. HP-&#946;-CD and emulsion excipients showed little or no cytotoxicity. The MEs exhibited more toxicity in the LDH assay than in the MTS assay. 
 A reversed phase HPLC assay for simultaneous determination of RBZ and its metabolite in sheep plasma using an isocratic system with UV detection was developed and used in the pharmacokinetic studies. Plasma samples were prepared by solid phase extraction. A suitable internal standard was selected by quantitative structure-retention relationships analysis. The composition of a ternary mobile phase was optimised with the assistance of multiple linear regression. The assays were linear over the concentration range 10 - 1000 ng/ml for both analytes (r &gt; 0.999) with satisfactory inter-day and intra-day precision and accuracy (CV &lt; 10%). The recoveries for all analytes were &gt; 96%. 
 A pilot study in sheep suggests that injection of the vehicles (the CD, emulsion and ME) caused virtually no pain on injection or site reactions. Both the reference formulation and its vehicle induced pain on injection and resulted in swollen tissues. Histology after two weeks showed granulation for the formulation, but not the vehicle. In contrast, animals showed virtually no injection site reactions with the ME and emulsion. The HP-&#946;-CD formulation gave transient pain on injection but a two-fold increase in bioavailability compared with the reference. The emulsion produced sustained drug release and increased drug absorption. In the main study, the HP-&#946;-CD vehicle showed good tissue compatibility. Irritation by the HP-&#946;-CD formulation was attributed to the low pH. Cmax, tmax and AUC0-[infinity] for the reference formulation were 1.3 &#65533; 0.3 [mu]g/ml, 9.6 &#65533; 2.9 h and 36.7 &#65533; 9.2 [mu]g&#65533;h/ml respectively, while the corresponding data for the HP-&#946;-CD formulation were 2.9 &#65533; 0.8 [mu]g/ml, 5.0 &#65533; 0.6 h and 54.5 &#65533; 15.3 [mu]g&#65533;h/ml respectively. The half-life following the injection of the HP-&#946;-CD formulation (5.5 &#65533; 2.8 h) was shorter than that of the reference formulation (8.5 &#65533; 3.4 h). 
 Conclusions: Injection site reactions may be minimised by identification of irritant components in a formulation and by controlling their release. Controlling the burst release of the poorly water soluble drug RBZ in a low pH solution could improve tissue tolerance and minimise post-injection precipitation, and hence increase drug bioavailability. In addition, HP-&#946;-CD was a useful local injectable carrier which significantly enhanced the absorption of RBZ after subcutaneous injection in sheep.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">injections</field><field name="subject">side effects</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">solubility</field><field name="subject">bioavailability</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.122315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, language and translation issues in educational assessment : Maori immersion students in the National Education Monitoring Project</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Janet Aileen</field><field name="description">1999 was the first year that Year 8 Maori immersion students were included in national monitoring in New Zealand. The thesis explores how bilingualism, being a second language learner, and culture impact on student performance. It details the National Education Monitoring Project&#65533;s (NEMP) efforts to create fair and valid cross-language and cross-culture assessment. The thesis looks at overseas research on the development, translation and administration of tasks and relates this to NEMP&#65533;s processes. Issues and problems that arose during the development, translation and administration of tasks are discussed. 
 Several positions emerge from this thesis. Firstly, that despite the problems encountered, there were some clear &#65533;benefits&#65533;. Benefits lay primarily in: recognition of the complexity of cross-language and cross-cultural assessment, &#65533;improved&#65533; assessment and translation processes, professional development, new understanding and knowledge areas, identification of areas for future research and the accumulation of data (albeit in some instances problematic). Secondly, that NEMP went to great efforts to consult with and involve Maori. However, the relationship between NEMP and Maori was compromised in that some sectors within immersion education were ambivalent about participating in national monitoring. This ambivalence impacted in a number of ways on the project and the assessment of immersion students. Thirdly, that the inclusion of immersion students in national monitoring needs to be seen within the wider social, political and historical context of New Zealand. Assessment is not a neutral process. Assessment is a social and political activity that has the potential to advantage certain groups in society and disadvantage others. 
 Fourthly, despite NEMP&#65533;s efforts to be fair, inclusive and thorough in its processes there were significant issues that compromised students&#65533; performance and the quality of the information gathered. Limited language skills of some students, cultural differences, translation and task administration problems at times worked to the disadvantage of immersion students and raise questions about the validity of some findings. Finally, I suggest that the inclusion of Maori immersion students in national monitoring is in some respects premature and unfair. In particular, questions need to be asked about the fairness and validity of making comparisons between bilingual, second language learners in Maori immersion settings and monolingual Maori students learning in English in the mainstream.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">matauranga</field><field name="subject">immersion</field><field name="subject">kura kaupapa</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070516.152005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are New Zealand Treaty of Waitangi settlements achieving justice? : the Ngai Tahu settlement and the return of Pounamu (greenstone)</field><field name="creator">Kay-Gibbs, Meredith</field><field name="description">Achieving &#65533;justice&#65533; is the overriding aim of the Treaty settlement process. This process was established to resolve Maori historical grievances against the New Zealand Crown for alleged breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. Because historical injustices involve the interactions of cultures over time, justice in the Treaty settlement process is shaped, and constrained, by two main factors: &#65533;culture&#65533; and &#65533;time&#65533;. The settlement of Ngai Tahu&#65533;s historical grievances, and in particular the return of pounamu as part of the settlement, achieved a large measure of this limited kind of justice. The Ngai Tahu settlement and the return of pounamu suggest that Treaty settlements are achieving, and may continue to achieve, a large measure of the justice available in the Treaty settlement process.
	Examination of the return of pounamu to Ngai Tahu reveals, however, that new injustices may have been created in the Ngai Tahu settlement. These new injustices are critically analysed, and recommendations for maximising justice in the Treaty settlement process are suggested. If Treaty settlements are to achieve the maximum justice available in the Treaty settlement process, the Treaty partners must heed the warning signs arising from the possible creation of new injustices in the Ngai Tahu settlement.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">Waitangi Tribunal</field><field name="subject">land tenure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.111541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discourse on the nature of Te Whanake [kit] : a series of textbooks and resources for adult learners of Maori : a commentary on the body of work submitted for the degree of Doctor of Literature at the University of Otago</field><field name="creator">Moorfield, John C</field><field name="description">As suggested in the regulations for the degree, this discourse on the nature of the Te Whanake series of Maori language textbooks and resources is being submitted with the series in support of the application for the award of the degree of Doctor of Literature (LittD) at the University of Otago.
	The purpose of this discourse is to make explicit some of the principles that underlie what is contained in the textbooks, the audio-and videotapes and the teachers&#65533; manuals. Some of this commentary repeats information provided in Maori or English in the teachers&#65533; manuals. As well as concentrating information about the nature of the Te Whanake series into one document, it is also for the benefit of those who do not understand Maori.
	This commentary will:
	outline the author&#65533;s background leading up to the writing of the Te Whanake series;
	discuss the content of the textbooks and resources;
	make explicit the teaching methodology underpinning the series and how these methods are implemented;
	explain the principles used in creating the textbooks and tape-recorded exercises; and discuss the pedagogic grammar of the Maori language contained in the textbooks.
	While the four student textbooks are central to the submission, the total set of resources needs to be considered. The description in Chapter Two will give an insight into what the four student textbooks, the teachers&#65533; manuals, the study guides and the audio-and videotaped exercises contain.
	While the textbooks, teachers&#65533; manuals, study guides and audiotapes of the Te Whanake series are original work by the author, the series does draw on the work of fluent speakers and writers of Maori, especially in the more advanced textbooks and supporting resources. This was necessary to expose the learners to a variety of contemporary texts as well as examples by writers from last century when Maori was still very much the language of Maori communities.
	It seems that by 1929 Maori was being offered as a unit for the Bachelor of Arts degree by the University of New Zealand, although there is conflicting information regarding the precise date when this started. However, it was not until 1951 that the language was actually taught by a permanent member of the faculty at any constituent college of the University of New Zealand when Professor Bruce Biggs was appointed Lecturer in Maori Studies at the University of Auckland.The other universities in New Zealand have gradually followed. The University of Waikato introduced Maori as a subject for a Bachelors degree early in its life in 1970 under the leadership of Timoti Karetu, but the University of Otago, which was established in 1869, only introduced Maori as a subject in 1981 despite having produced some outstanding Maori graduates such as Sir Peter Buck.
	It was only with the production of the Te Whanake textbooks and resources that a comprehensive series designed to teach Maori as a second language to adults has become available. Prior to the production of these resources the material available for teaching Maori language to adults was limited to a few grammar textbooks, the best of which was Bruce Biggs&#65533; Let&#65533;s Learn Maori. Other textbooks available were designed for teaching the language to children, the most notable of which are the more advanced textbook by Timoti Karetu called Te Reo Rangatira. There were no Maori language textbooks designed for developing the receptive and productive skills of adult learners of Maori. Some European languages such as English, French, Spanish and German have a variety of helpful and well designed textbooks and accompanying resources for adult foreign language learners. Maori had no such resources.
	The Te Whanake series provides the basis for a structured Maori language programme from beginner level through to the advanced learner of Maori. While further resources will continue to be added to the series, with the publication in 1996 of Te Whanake 4 Te Kohure and its set of six videotapes there is finally a comprehensive set of resources for teaching Maori to adults.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">reo Maori</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.152527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can indigenous movements globalise?</field><field name="creator">McElwreath, Jennifer L</field><field name="description">The world&#65533;s indigenous peoples have been subjected to exploitation, discrimination, dispossession, relocation, assimilation and in some cases genocide since contact with the Western world. They have been the victims of an invasion which has since secured their position among the lowest social qualifiers. For centuries, they have been ignored by nation-states throughout the world. However, a new dawn has risen for the first peoples of the world, and for the past two decades thaey have experienced a cultural, political and social revival which has been gaining in popularity, intensity and effectiveness since it&#65533;s inception.
	The politicisation of indigenous movements and their fundamentally local characteristics has occurred at the same time that the world is experiencing a sense of accelerated globalisation. Economic integration through trade agreements has diminished boundaries and has allowed multinational corporations to travel, sell and trade at will. The sense that the world is &#65533;one place&#65533; has fast become a reality through "the increasing volume and rapidity of the flows of money, goods, people, information, technology and images." (Featherstone, 1995:81)
	The simultaneous globalisation and localisation of the world seems to be two contradictory phenomenon acting in opposition to one another. However, as several theorists have pointed out, the two are actually related and each to some degree attributes to the existence of the other (Eriksen, 1993:9; Featherstone, 1990:10; Friedman, 1990:327). In fact, indigenous movements themselves, while asserting local issues and rights, have undergone a recent transformation and now attempt to achieve their goals through global strategies. They have expanded their methods and now not only at the community and national levels, but also within the international arena.
	The Maori and the Native Hawaiians are two groups of indigenous peoples who have been fighting for their rights and land for over a century. Both groups represent small percentages of their nation-states&#65533; population. This has forced them to pursue their struggle with creative strategies and persistent, patient pressure. Thus, their struggles have undergone continouos transformations in attempts to discover the most effective formula which would eventually cause their respective nation-states to recognise and address their grievances.
	Recently, the Maori and the Native Hawaiians, have broadened their movement to incorporate an international tier. Activity on the international level includes international conferences, international visits/exchanges, ratification of indigenous declarations, indigenous networking, and international indigenous solidarity organisations. These activities have increased over the past twenty years as the effectiveness of such activity has also increased. New Zealand, the United States and other nation-states are being held more accountable for past injustices and are being driven to answer to the world&#65533;s indigenous community.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Hawaii</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">self-determination</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.144243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The recognition of Maori customary fisheries in New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries management regime : a case study of taiapure</field><field name="creator">Ririnui, Teneti</field><field name="description">The Treaty of Waitangi specifically recognises the rights of Maori to control and manage their fisheries resources. However, since the imposition of fisheries legislation in New Zealand, this right has been consistently eroded. It is only recently that Maori customary fisheries rights have been given a degree of recognition in New Zealand&#65533;s fisheries management regime.
	The taiapure provisions of the Fisheries Act 1996 are one of the few policy initiatives available for Maori to manage their fisheries resources in accordance with their customary tikanga. This study examines the effectiveness of the taiapure legislation in providing for Maori customary fisheries management. The Maketu taiapure in the Bay of Plenty is studied to analyse the implementation of the initiative at the local level.
	The study has found that there are limitations inherent in the legislation and that these are further complicated by inadequacies in its implementation. Recommendations regarding the size, management and establishment process, are made at the conclusion of the study to highlight the amendments needed for the taiapure provisions to properly recognise and provide for the role of Maori, as Treaty partners, in the management of their local fisheries.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">fishery law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070530.143237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Pakeha harp : Maori mythology in the works of four early New Zealand poets.</field><field name="creator">Barnhill, Helen M</field><field name="description">The Maori people - those Polynesians who moved to the cooler islands of New Zealand - possessed a mythology that matched their own great qualities. They had a myth of the Creation that rivals Genesis in beauty, a pantheon of gods and heroes who can be mentioned in the same breath as those of the Greeks, and a store of splendid tribal histories, half factual, half fabulous, ...
	These are the opening lines of the Preface to a recently published selection of Maori myths and legends in translation: they indicate how strongly many modern New Zealanders are attracted to the various forms of Maori literature. But this is no new phenomen. For the receptive Pakeha mind has been fascinated by Maori mythology since the very beginnings of European settlement in New Zealand. Indeed, if anything, the magnetic appeal of Maori myth and legend was probably most evident in the earliest years of intercultural contact.
	Thomas Kendall was one of the first missionaries to work among the Maori people. Unlike most of his fellow-evangelists, Kendall determined to study and so understand the religion and customs of his adopted flock. Unfortunately, this &#65533;tragic, Faustian figure&#65533; was soon out of his depth. Kendall wrote,
	I am now, after a long, anxious, and painful study, arriving at the very foundation and groundwork of the cannibalism and superstitions of these islanders. All their notions are metaphysical, and I have been so poisoned withh the apparent sublimity of their ideas that I have been almost completely turned from a Christian to a heathen.
	Another early missionary, Richard Taylor, also studied Maori beliefs in depth. But Taylor, though he felt impelled by his inter-course with the Maori to write a long and influential treatise on his interpretation of Maoritanga, did manage to retain a degree of scholarly objectivity towards his subject. Yet even so, Taylor acknowledges in his treatise that,
	The Maori mythology is extremely interesting, and quite different from what we should expect from a people sunk in barbarism. ... Their ideas in some respects are not so puerile, as those even of the more civilized heathens of old, and without the light of inspiration, could not be expected to be more advanced.
	Nor were secular scholars immune to "Maori fever." Sir George Grey wrote of the Maori that &#65533; their traditions are puerile&#65533; and their &#65533;religious faith ... is absurd&#65533;. Yet during the eight years that he was Governor of the nascent colony of New Zealand in a period of constant interracial stress, Grey devoted a great deal of what little spare time he had to the collection and publication of the myths and legends, and &#65533;the ancient traditional poems, religious chants, and songs, of the Maori race&#65533;-- Introduction. Four poets are considered: Alfred Domett (1811-1887), Arthur Henry Adams (1872-1936), Jessie Mackay (1864-1938), Blanche E.

E. S. (Marjorie Edith Stuart)</field><field name="description">Summary: 	 In order that one may approach the main theme of this thesis, the massacre at Poverty Bay, the events leading there to, and the effects thereof, some slight knowledge is required of the general situation in New Zealand in the years immediately preceding. The writer considers that no apology is needed for introducing into a work that has for its title "The Poverty Bay Massacre of 1868", such apparently unrelated topics as the campaigns of 1845 to 1868 and the cult of Pai-Marire.
	In any historical review, cause and effect are so closely related that it is difficult, when choosing a particular field of research, to decide how much to include and, more important, how much to discard. The Maori Wars in the Waikato and Taranaki districts spread through the whole of the North Island and in time to the East Coast. Here they were intensified by the blend of Christianity and savage barbarity that is known as Pai-Marire or Hauhauism. It was during this campaign on the Coast that Te Kooti Rikirangi first came into political prominence.
	A study of Hauhauism is interesting in itself; reviewed in connection with the central figure of this thesis, Te Kooti, it acquires new significance. It is doubtful how far he was sincere in the religious ritual he instituted, itself a modification, and an adaptation of the old Pai-Marire cult, but out of it he fashioned a powerful weapon against the Pakeha. Perhaps it deserves a place as a psychological study of the influence of community worship in a mysterious and militant ritual upon the religious emotionalism of any sect and when, as here, that sect was composed of semi-civilised or wholly savage Maoris at a critical period in the history of their race, it was inevitable that it should issue in action.
	This thesis represents an attempt at more than merely collecting loose threads about the massacre into one narrative.
	It has been the writer&#65533;s aim to place the massacre in its right setting in the history of New Zealand, and thus to show its significance. The method chosen has been that of grouping the events round one central figure, that of the perpetrator of the massacre, and the first four chapters therefore are incidental though necessary. The history of this man continues long after 1868, the date of the massacre and a small section has been added to cover the period 1868 to 1893, the year of his death on the plea that though irrelevant to the subject of the thesis it gives a rounded effect that might otherwise be lacking--Introduction.</field><field name="date">1935</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Pai-Marire</field><field name="subject">Hau-hau</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">land wars</field><field name="subject">Te Kooti Rikirangi</field><field name="subject">East Coast</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.110754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maori population of Otago.</field><field name="creator">Durward, Elizabeth Wallace</field><field name="description">Summary: Although a good deal of information is available about the Maoris of New Zealand, concerning their origin, customs, and culture, yet statistical data regarding their actual numbers at any time before 1857 are comparatively rare. It is a fact that the Maori population in any given locality was a fluctuating one and that their distribution in general was very variable and this constitutes a formidable difficulty in making any estimate of their numbers before the first cenus. A second obstacle is the difficulty of travel which faced the early European explorers. For example, when Cook visited New Zealand, he made an estimate of the population but it was largely conjectural as Cook saw the natives at only those places he touched around the coast, and had in fact no means of estimating what proportion of the total population those communities formed. Actually the Maoris were not confined to the coastline, and therefore Cook&#65533;s estimate cannot be regarded as based on adequate data. An evaluation of his estimate will be made later--Chapter 1.</field><field name="date">1929</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070625.123252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precipitation variability in the South Island of New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mojzisek, Jan</field><field name="description">Precipitation is one of the atmospheric variables that characterize the climate of a region. The South Island of New Zealand (SI of NZ) has an unusually large number of distinct regional climates and its climatic diversity includes the coldest, wettest, driest and windiest places in New Zealand. This thesis focuses on identifying precipitation trends and rainfall fluctuations for the SI of NZ. 
 First, homogeneity of 184 precipitation series is assessed with the combination of three homogeneity tests (Standard Normal Homogeneity Test, Easterling &amp; Peterson test, Vincent&#65533;s Multiple Linear Regression). More than 60% of tested time series are found to contain at least one inhomogeneity. About 50% of the inhomogeneities can be traced to information in the station history files with nearly 25% of all inhomogeneities caused by the relocation of the precipitation gauge. 
 Five coherent precipitation regions are defined by the Principal Component Analysis. The objective of identifying the periods of water deficit and surplus in spatial and temporal domains is achieved by using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI series (for 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 months time scales) are calculated for each region and used for analysis of dry and wet periods. Clear differences in the frequency, length and intensity of droughts and wet periods were found between individual regions. There is a positive (i.e. increase in wet periods) trend in SPI time series for the North, Westland and Southland regions during the 1921-2003 period at all times scales, and a negative trend for Canterbury during the same period. The results show longer wet periods than dry periods at all time scales. 
 Extreme heavy precipitation, which causes floods, is the most common type of natural disaster accounting for about 40% of all natural disasters worldwide. A set of ten extreme indices is calculated for 51 stations throughout the South Island for the period 1951-2003. The west-east division is found to be the dominant feature of extreme precipitation trends for all extreme indices with more frequent and more intense extreme precipitation in the west/southwest and with a declining trend in the east. The significant decrease in extreme precipitation frequency was detected in Canterbury with 3 days less of precipitation above the long-term 95th percentile by 2003 as compared to 1951. 
 The variability of precipitation, expressed by the SPI, is correlated with local New Zealand atmospheric circulation indices and large-scale teleconnections. The precipitation variability in the South Island is governed largely by the local circulation characteristics, mainly the strength and position of the westerly flow. The increase in precipitation in the West and SouthEast is associated with enhanced westerlies. The correlations between New Zealand&#65533;s circulation indices and regional SPI are seasonally robust. The SouthEast region exhibits a strong relationship with the Southern Oscillation Index on seasonal and annual time scales,and with Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation at the decadal scale. The predictability of seasonal precipitation one season ahead is very limited.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">precipitation variability</field><field name="subject">precipitation (meteorology)</field><field name="subject">precipitation forecasting</field><field name="subject">observations</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070503.151144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1961 Kampong Bukit Ho Swee Fire and the Making of Modern Singapore</field><field name="creator">LKSHIS@gmail.com</field><field name="description">By 1970, Singapore&#146;s urban landscape was dominated by high-rise blocks of planned public housing built by the People&#146;s Action Party government, signifying the establishment of a high modernist nation-state. A decade earlier, the margins of the City had been dominated by kampongs, home to semi-autonomous communities of low-income Chinese families which freely built, and rebuilt, unauthorised wooden houses. This change was not merely one of housing but belied a more fundamental realignment of state-society relations in the 1960s. Relocated in Housing and Development Board flats, urban kampong families were progressively integrated into the social fabric of the emergent nation-state. This study examines the pivotal role of an event, the great Kampong Bukit Ho Swee fire of 1961, in bringing about this transformation. The redevelopment of the fire site in the aftermath of the calamity brought to completion the British colonial regime&#146;s &#145;emergency&#146; programmes of resettling urban kampong dwellers in planned accommodation, in particular, of building emergency public housing on the sites of major fires in the 1950s. The PAP&#146;s far greater political resolve, and the timing of and state of emergency occasioned by the scale of the 1961 disaster, enabled the government to rehouse the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims in emergency housing in record time. This in turn provided the HDB with a strategic platform for clearing other kampongs and for transforming their residents into model citizens of the nation-state. The 1961 fire&#146;s symbolic usefulness extended into the 1980s and beyond, in sanctioning the PAP&#146;s new housing redevelopment schemes. The official account of the inferno has also become politically useful for the government of today for disciplining a new generation of Singaporeans against taking the nation&#146;s progress for granted. Against these exalted claims of the fire&#146;s role in the Singapore Story, this study also examines the degree of actual change and continuity in the social and economic lives of the people of Bukit Ho Swee after the inferno. In some crucial ways, the residents continued to occupy a marginal place in society while pondering, too, over the unresolved question of the cause of the fire. These continuities of everyday life reflect the ambivalence with which the citizenry regarded the high modernist state in contemporary Singapore.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singapore history</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">Bukit Ho Swee</field><field name="subject">kampong</field><field name="subject">PAP</field><field name="subject">HDB</field><field name="subject">social history</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">high modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090219.104739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fashion and the artworld : intersection, interplay and collusion since 1982</field><field name="creator">Smith, Natalie D.</field><field name="description">Fashion scholarship has prospered since the 1980s. Yet in spite of the stimulating research in this field, principally in the domain of design, gender, media and cultural studies, only a handful of scholars have written about fashion&#65533;s relationship with the artworld. This, inspite of the artworld increasingly drawing upon the idiom of fashion - &#65533;the new&#65533;, &#65533;the now&#65533; and hype, and the evolvement of sartorial fashion into an exciting new artistic medium as the result of an increasingly experimental attitude towards design. This thesis considers the idiom of fashion as part of art-making, and how we might critically approach fashion design as a visual arts practice. 
 The relationship between fashion and the artworld is explored using the ideas of intersection, interplay and collusion. In utilising these ideas to explore the rapport between fashion and the artworld the multi-faceted nature of fashion&#65533;s relationship with the artworld, the slippages between the commercial and creative imperatives of fashion, are brought to the surface. 
 This project grew out of a &#65533;debate&#65533; emerging in the 1980s and 1990s and occurring in articles and exhibitions which sought to identify and elaborate on a closer rapport between fashion and art. Based on this &#65533;debate&#65533; six sites of connection are considered, beginning with a discussion on writing about fashion from a visual arts perspective, and where a range of proponents and proposals are considered. The thesis then shifts to an analysis of the February 1982 special issue of Artforum which featured a garment designed by Issey Miyake on its cover. This is followed by an exploration of the value attached to fashion in the artworld. The fashion designer&#65533;s self-construction as a visual artist is the subject of the next chapter, followed by a look at the emergence of Conceptual Couture - ideas-based fashion. The final chapter considers fashion in the exhibition environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion and art</field><field name="subject">fashion in art</field><field name="subject">clothing and dress</field><field name="subject">fashion design</field><field name="subject">costume design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070417.122533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of post consumption narrative : an exploration of identity and 'cool'</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Shelagh Wyn</field><field name="description">Consumers tell stories every day: stories about the products they buy, the experiences they consume, even their friends&#65533; and families&#65533; consumption experiences - in fact, stories about most aspects of their lives. People live &#65533;storied&#65533; lives. Consumption experiences are understood and related to others through stories (2003). These stories are loaded with personal, social and cultural meaning that varies significantly dependent upon the intended audience and effect (Bruner 1987) 
 Stories are everywhere and understanding these narratives in relation to consumer experience is a challenge that consumer research must embrace (Stern 1998b). The study of such narratives must address issues such as the content of the story, how it is told, who is actually doing the telling and for what purpose. All these stories exist in context. These contexts are not a means in themselves; rather, they are a means to understand a particular aspect of a consumer phenomenon. In this case, the research presented in this thesis seeks to understand the purpose and function of consumers&#65533; narratives about commercial adventure experiences. Hence the context of this research is commercial adventure experiences consumed in Queenstown, New Zealand, billed in promotional tourist literature as &#65533;the adventure capital of the world&#65533; (Smitz et al. 2004). This specific focus on commercial adventure therefore defines the sample group as consumers of commercial adventure experiences in Queenstown. Hence, the scope of this research is limited to understanding the phenomenon under investigation (consumer narratives) in relation to members of Generation Y, as they are the primary consumers of commercial adventure experiences in New Zealand. 
 This research adopts an interpretive, inductive approach utilising qualitative tools to frame and develop an evolving research question. The primary data collection has an initial framing of the research question phase and then three main phases utilising a variety of qualitative tools including observation, in-depth interviewing and videography. The research addressed many issues, including the preference of consumers to narrate these adventure consumption experiences to their most valued community, their home community, and how they intended to tell their stories to their home community when removed from that community. Additionally, consumers&#65533; perceptions of &#65533;cool&#65533; were investigated, together with the reactions they anticipated receiving from their audiences. This research investigated &#65533;cool&#65533; as a more meaningful term than status, used by the members of Generation Y to describe the most desired outcome for the narration of their consumption experiences. 
 Several key themes emerged from this research. They were the use of these consumer experience narratives in the identity-construction process, both collectively and individually, and how this related to the classic hero myth identity construction (Campbell 1972) and how &#65533;cool&#65533; was acquired by these consumers through their narrations. Implications of the findings are presented for consumer research with specific reference to a model of community formation based on consumption practices and Generation Y as a community sharing a consciousness of kind.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">shopping</field><field name="subject">consumption (economics)</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Generation Y</field><field name="subject">consumers</field><field name="subject">identity (psychology)</field><field name="subject">popular culture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.111413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supramolecular complexes of multimodal ligands</field><field name="creator">Black, Cory A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and X-ray crystallographic analysis of a series of supramolecular architectures prepared using seven flexible multimodal ligands with Ag(I), Cu(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Pd(II) metal salts. 
 Chapter one introduces some examples of fundamental supramolecular systems with particular focus on metallo-supramolecular motifs, specifically coordination polymers. Topological analysis is discussed as a method for the simplified description and comparison of network structures. 
 Chapter two describes the design, synthesis and characterisation of the symmetrical ligands bis(2-pyrazylmethyl)sulfide (psp), bis(4-pyrimidylmethyl)sulfide (msm) and 5,5&#65533;-(thiodimethylene)di-pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (csc) as well as the asymmetrical ligands 2-benzylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psb), 2-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psd), 3-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psn) and 4-pyridylsulfanylmethyl-pyrazine (psy). 
 Chapter three presents a literature review of ligands related to psp, msm and csc, followed by the synthesis and characterization of thirteen Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes. The X-ray crystal structures of nine of these complexes are reported and compared. The structures were present as either one- or two-dimensional coordination polymers. The {[Ag(psp)](PF&#8326;)}[infinity] and {[Ag&#8322;(psp)(C&#8326;H&#8326;)(CH&#8323;CN)&#8322;](PF&#8326;)&#8322;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity] structures demonstrated a solvent dependence by forming a 1-D twisted ladder with a [eta]&#65533;-bound benzene and a 2-D undulating sheet with a 4.8&#65533; topology respectively. Six of the structures {[Cd&#8322;(psp)(CH&#8323;CN)(H&#8322;O)(NO&#8323;)&#8324;]&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity], {[Co(psp)(CH&#8323;CN)&#8322;](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;}[infinity], {[Ni(psp)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] and {[Ag(msm)](X)}[infinity] (X = BF&#8324;&#8315;, ClO&#8324;&#8315;, PF&#8326;&#8315;) displayed anion-[pi] interactions between multi-atomic anions and [pi]-acidic ring centres. A novel N[pz]&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;cent[pz] T-shaped [pi]-[pi] interaction was also identified in the {[Ni(psp)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] structure. A 2-D sheet with 6&#65533; topology was observed in the X-ray structure of {[Ag&#8322;(csc)](NO&#8323;)&#8322;}[infinity]. 
 Following a review of related ligands, chapter four focuses on seven Ag(I), Cd(II), Co(II) and Cu(I) complexes formed using the asymmetric pyrazine-benzene ligand psb. In total six 1-D coordination polymer chains are reported. Two structurally disparate supramolecular isomers were formed in [Ag(psb)NO&#8323;][infinity] and {[Ag&#8322;(psb)&#8322;NO&#8323;]NO&#8323;&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity]. The compound {[Ag(psb)](BF&#8324;)}[infinity] was similar to the former isomer [Ag(psb)NO&#8323;][infinity]. The structurally similar coordination polymers {[Cd(psb)(H&#8322;O)(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]}[infinity] and {[Co(psb)(H&#8322;O)&#8323;](ClO&#8324;)&#8322;&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity] formed structures that showed anion-[pi] interactions using coordinated and non-coordinated anions respectively. The [Cu&#8322;(psb)I&#8322;][infinity] chain consisted of ligands linked together by a Cu&#8324;I&#8324; stepped cubane tetramer. 
 Chapter five presents seventeen Ag(I) and Cu(I) complexes prepared using three asymmetric pyrazine-pyridine ligands psd, psn and psy. A review of asymmetric pyrazine-pyridine ligands is provided. Seventeen X-ray crystal structures are described. Four psd complexes using AgBF&#8324;, AgClO&#8324;, AgNO&#8323; and AgPF&#8326; crystallised as discrete dimers with three types of crystal packing and ligand-supported Ag&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Ag interactions. The complexes {[Ag&#8322;(psd)&#8322;CF&#8323;SO&#8323;]CF&#8323;SO&#8323;}[infinity] and {Cu&#8322;(psd)I&#8322;}[infinity] were a 1-D X-shaped chain and a 2-D 6&#65533; net respectively. The isostructural 2-D sheets in {[Ag(psn)]ClO&#8324;}[infinity] and {[Ag(psn)]PF&#8326;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity], had 4.8&#65533; topologies whereas a thicker sheet was formed in {[Ag&#8322;(psn)&#8322;](BF&#8324;)&#8322;}[infinity] with a complicated (4&#65533;.6&#65533;.8&#65533;)&#8322;(4.6.8)&#8322; topology. The {[Ag&#8323;(psn)&#8322;](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#8323;&#65533;CH&#8323;CN}[infinity] chain polymer displayed three different coordination geometries around the three Ag(I) centres with two ligand-unsupported Ag&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;Ag interactions. The complex [Cu&#8322;(psn)&#8322;I&#8322;] crystallised as a discrete dimer with a different ligand arrangement than those found in the psd dimers. Six Ag(I) 3-D networks were formed using psy. The complexes {[Ag(psy)]X}[infinity] (X = BF&#8324;, ClO&#8324;, PF&#8326;) formed as isostructural non-interpenetrated (10,3)-d networks. An unprecedented tri-nodal (4.6.8)&#8322;(6.8&#65533;)&#8322;(4.6.8&#65533;.10)&#8322; topology was observed in the {[Ag&#8322;(psy)&#8322;](CF&#8323;SO&#8323;)&#8322;}[infinity] structure. The suprarmolecular isomers {[Ag&#8323;(psy)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)&#8322;]NO&#8323;]}[infinity] and {[Ag&#8323;(psy)&#8322;(NO&#8323;)&#8323;]&#65533;H&#8322;O}[infinity] formed inclined interpenetrated 6&#65533; sheets and a (4&#65533;.6)&#8322;(4&#8308;.6&#65533;.8&#8312;.10) 3-D network respectively. The structures in this chapter showed a general trend of increasing dimensionality when progressing from psd to psn to psy.

As crisis genesis research is still in its infancy, the main objective is to develop a theoretical framework that is well-grounded in data of crisis-causal processes. 
 The first part of the literature review examines the need for crisis-causal research and comes to the following conclusions: Crises are significant phenomena for organisations. During crises, a company&#65533;s survival is threatened and its central functions are deeply affected. Although interest in crisis research developed strongly over the last decade, the field is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage that requires an inductive logic of inquiry. In addition, the majority of research in this field is focused on the consequences of crises. This preponderance towards crisis consequences leaves crisis-causal research under-theorised. Hence, theory-building on the genesis of organisational crisis represents an important gap that needs to be addressed. 
 The second part of the literature review presents the small field of extant causal research on crises as well as on crisis-related phenomena such as disasters. Insights of these studies are used to pre-specify potentially relevant constructs as well as to develop methodological implications for the subsequent theory-building task. 
 In this thesis a case study methodology is employed. Four cases of crisis-causal processes in large U.S. public companies were examined in-depth. Firstly, a within-case analysis was conducted. Secondly, the results of each case were compared in an across-case analysis. For both analyses, four analytical strategies were employed, namely a quantification strategy, a narrative strategy, a visual mapping strategy and, most importantly, a grounded theory strategy. 
 The results of the analysis are five well-grounded constructs that aim to explain the crisis-causal process common across cases. These constructs are the building blocks for two theoretical frameworks developed in this thesis. While the first framework presents a simple graphic depiction of these constructs, the second framework demonstrates how these constructs are linked. In general, the results suggest that a crisis is caused by a combination of company-specific factors and underlying dynamics that evolve through three distinct phases in an exponential fashion: a phase of stability (pre-crisis stage), a phase of increasing instability (crisis onset) and a phase of resolution (crisis and its aftermath). By setting up positive feedback loops that continually magnify the severity of problems generated by events, a self-reinforcing vicious cycle is established that increases the onset of crisis at an exponentional rate. 
 The results suggest that a crisis unfolds due to a problem structure which becomes increasingly intractable. This is accompanied by an increasing number of events that the organisation needs to deal with as it approaches the crisis point. In addition, three underlying dynamics were identified as crisis-contributing factors: a process of increasing denial, a process of decreasing degrees of freedom and a process of decreasing support of key players. 
 The thesis closes with a summary and discussion of the results. It is illustrated to what extent the theory developed in this work links to concurring and conflicting findings of the extant body of crisis knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">crisis</field><field name="subject">industrial</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">bankruptcy</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">social sciences</field><field name="subject">organizational change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070608.100146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Martial Epigrammata Book X : a commentary</field><field name="creator">Francis, Charlotte</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the first full-scale commentary on Book 10 of Martial&#65533;s Epigrams. Jenkins&#65533; commentary on Book 10, a thesis from Cambridge in 1982, is the other detailed commentary on Book 10, but examines only 23 of the 104 epigrams from the book, selected according to significance or as being representative of broad categories and themes. My primary purpose is to present a literary analysis of the complete book, taking into account the literary tradition, and explaining the poems from a historical, social and political perspective. Most commentaries follow a traditional approach where the focus is investigation of the philological aspects of each epigram. These commentaries in their analysis of individual poems often fail to provide insight into Martial&#65533;s literary intentions for a particular poem, and the book as a coherent whole is generally not taken into consideration. My commentary provides an exploration of programmatic and structural issues which contribute to the book&#65533;s thematic continuity and unity. Aspects for consideration include the function and application of themes and motifs throughout the book, interrelationships of poems and their position within the book. Examination of these features is fundamental towards understanding Martial&#65533;s literary objectives in Book 10.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Martial</field><field name="subject">epigrams</field><field name="subject">epigrammata</field><field name="subject">Rome</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">criticism</field><field name="subject">Latin</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070614.133509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) expression is a potential limiting factor in adenoviral oncotheraphy</field><field name="creator">Wiles, Karen Anna</field><field name="description">Novel approaches to cancer treatment in the context of Gene Therapy have been gaining popularity as an alternative to conventional therapies which have proven to lack specificity, resulting in tumour cell resistance, tumour progression and mortality. As a consequence the use of adenoviruses has been widely developed not only as a replication deficient vector for gene therapy but also as a replication competent oncolytic agent designed to selectively target and kill tumour cells. Unfortunately their success in clinical application has been limited, and it has been suggested that a lack of the primary viral attachment receptor 'CAR' could be a barrier to infection by limiting access to target cells. If Ad/CAR binding is the rate limiting step for successful Ad therapy, it is essential to establish a CAR expression profile in normal and tumour tissue, and in tumour progression, to enable more effective targeted therapy. Furthermore, in the context of using adenovirus as an anticancer strategy by exploiting its replicative lysis, it is important to explore whether Ad success is affected by CAR expression and to identify factors downstream of CAR that may be influential in this process. 
 In the first experimental chapter, an in vivo immunohistochemical analysis of tissue array slides determined CAR expression in a range of normal and tumour tissue. CAR was differentially expressed dependent on cell of origin, with normal stem cells and basal cells displaying very high CAR, signifying its importance in early development and differentiation. Epithelial cells were also high in CAR but its expression was negligible in mesenchymal, lymphoid and neural cells. This trend was also reflected in most tumour tissue albeit with a general decrease in CAR compared to corresponding normal tissue of the same organ. An exception was the blastic tumours which displayed high CAR reflecting their embryonic state of derivation. CAR expression also decreased in high grade, poorly differentiated tumours of the prostate, stomach and breast compared to their well differentiated counterparts. 
 In the second experimental chapter, a more comprehensive study of breast cancer biopsy specimens was undertaken, to determine both the expression of CAR and the tumour suppressor gene p53 in relation to tumour grade. The rationale being that both loss of CAR expression and p53 mutation (resulting in loss of function), have been associated with tumour progression. It is possible that CAR and p53 interact directly or indirectly and may be modulated by each other. This study revealed a decrease in both CAR and hormone receptor expression and an increase in p53 'mutational' status with increasing tumour grade. These three factors when compared independently to tumour grade are statistically significant associations, implying that CAR expression and hormone responsiveness decrease with tumour progression and p53 function is compromised or lost via mutation. There was also a significant association between CAR expression and hormone receptor status, however a significant association between CAR expression and p53 status within the tumour grades was not found. 
 Treatment outcome with Ads will also depend on defining factors downstream of CAR attachment that affect adenovirus 'permissivity', which is ultimately measured by viral replication and cell death, relying on the bystander effect to eradicate all tumour cells. The in vitro analysis revealed statistically significant associations between CAR receptor expression, 'infectivity' (virus infection) and permissivity. Cell lines that were more susceptible to Ad5 were generally of epithelial origin, had high CAR, and were easily infected. However there were exceptions and CAR was not the sole determinant in adenovirus cell entry nor in its ability to replicate and kill the cell. Permissivity was also related to p53 status. Thus, although CAR expression may indeed be a limiting factor, it is apparent that a combination of other events contributes to a deficient infection, especially in the deregulated tumour environment. 
 The results presented in this thesis clearly demonstrate that there is more to the story of 'CAR' which hints that its role in viro-oncotherapy is not limited solely to its function as an attachment receptor for adenovirus but may also involve its function as a cell adhesion molecule and signal transducer. The further elucidation of these aspects of CAR&#65533;s potential role in the scheme of tumour biology may alter the course and strategy of cancer therapy in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viruses</field><field name="subject">adenoviruses</field><field name="subject">receptors</field><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.161353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the impact of a national hospital pharmaceutical strategy in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tordoff, June Margaret</field><field name="description">Background: In September 2001, in addition to their existing management of primary care pharmaceutical expenditure, PHARMAC, the New Zealand government&#65533;s Pharmaceutical Management Agency, was authorized to manage pharmaceutical expenditure in public hospitals.[1] In February 2002 PHARMAC launched a three-part Strategy, the National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy (NHPS), for this purpose.[2] The Strategy focused on Price Management (PM), the Assessment of New Medicines (ANM), and promoting Quality in the Use of Medicines (QUM). Major initiatives planned were: for PM, to negotiate new, national (as opposed to current, local) contracts for frequently used pharmaceuticals; for ANM, to provide economic assessments of new hospital medicines; and for QUM, to coordinate activities in hospitals. 
 Aims: To assess the impact of each of the three parts of the National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy, and assess any impact of the Strategy&#65533;s new contracts on the availability of those medicines. 
 Methods: Price Management was assessed in 2003, 2004 and 2005 using data from eleven selected hospitals to estimate savings for all 29 major hospitals, and by tracking hospital pharmaceutical expenditure from 2000 to 2006. For other aspects, cross-sectional surveys were administered to chief pharmacists at all hospitals employing a pharmacist; 30 hospitals in 2002, 29 in 2004. Surveys were undertaken in 2002 and 2004 to examine ANM and QUM activity in hospitals before and after the Strategy. Surveys were undertaken in 2004 and 2005 to examine any changes in the availability of medicines on new contracts, in hospitals. In 2005 a survey was undertaken of opinions on PHARMAC&#65533;s specially-developed pharmacoeconomic (PE) assessments. 
 Results: PM results indicated that, by 2006, savings of $7.84-13.45m per annum (6-8%) had been made on hospital pharmaceutical expenditure, and growth in inpatient pharmaceutical expenditure appeared to slow for all types of hospitals in 2003/4. ANM surveys indicated that, by 2004, hospital new medicine assessment processes, predominantly formal, became more complex, more focused on cost-effectiveness, and the use of pharmacoeconomic information increased. The PE survey indicated that PHARMAC&#65533;s economic assessments of new medicines were mainly viewed favourably but were not sufficiently timely to be widely used in hospital formulary decisions. Availability surveys indicated that new contracts occasionally caused availability problems e.g. products that were "out of stock", or products considered inferior by respondents. Problems were usually resolved within weeks, but some took over a year. QUM activities showed little change between surveys, but during the period an independent organisation was formed by the District Health Boards of New Zealand, with representation from PHARMAC, to coordinate the Safe and Quality Use of Medicines in New Zealand. 
 Conclusion: The National Hospital Pharmaceutical Strategy has been moderately successful in New Zealand. Savings of NZ$7.84-13.45m per annum were made, and growth in inpatient pharmaceutical expenditure appeared to slow in the year following the Strategy&#65533;s launch. The study has indicated some important short-term effects from the Strategy, but further research is needed to ensure that favourable effects are sustained and unfavourable effects kept to a minimum. Similar, centralized, multifaceted, approaches to managing pharmaceutical expenditure may be worth considering in other countries.

This problem has been recognised by judges, law reform bodies and legislators in both countries for twenty years. However, the legislative response has been inadequate. 
 The privilege is easily confused with other related concepts, particularly the right to silence in criminal proceedings. The reasons for the privilege in civil proceedings are not necessarily the same as for the right to silence. Care is therefore taken to define the terminology and scope of the thesis. It sets out the modern law on the privilege in civil proceedings between private parties. It describes how the privilege causes particular problems in those proceedings. It surveys the literature, finding that most of it concerns the right to silence. 
 The thesis draws heavily on the history of the privilege. It argues that, although witness privilege came from the common law, the privilege in interlocutory civil proceedings had its origins in the discretionary remedies devised by the courts of equity. They were sensitive to abuse of their remedies. For the same reason, modern prosecutors should not be encouraged to rely excessively upon evidence acquired through compulsory powers. 
 Derivative use immunity is one of several substitutes suggested for the privilege. The thesis looks at the various substitutes. It concludes that derivative use immunity is the only satisfactory substitute for the privilege in civil proceedings. 
 Derivative use immunity originated in the United States. The thesis looks closely at the American experience. The history and scope of the Fifth Amendment are discussed in detail, particularly the supposed removal of its protection from documents. This will show that the removal of the privilege from documents is not as simple as law reform bodies in Australia and New Zealand suggest. 
 Exaggerated claims have been made by Australian prosecutors about the problems caused by derivative use immunity. The claims are examined in the light of American case-law. This shows that an impossible burden is not imposed on prosecutors. The same point emerges when the thesis examines the operation of derivative use immunity under Australian certification procedures since 1995. 
 Particular procedural and legislative difficulties need to be addressed, particularly when derivative use immunity replaces the privilege in interlocutory proceedings. However, certification by the court has an important advantage. The court&#65533;s exercise of its discretion provides the flexibility which automatic statutory immunity lacks. 
 The question in the title is therefore answered in the affirmative. Derivative use immunity under a statutory certification procedure can provide the answer. Cooperation between the Commonwealth and States may be needed to overcome constitutional difficulties, but most other problems can be overcome if derivative use immunity is given a sound statutory basis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">self-incrimination</field><field name="subject">civil</field><field name="subject">procedure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070815.094307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroluminescent and photoluminescent properties of metal-based compounds</field><field name="creator">Lundin, Natasha J</field><field name="description">Organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are an emerging display technology with the advantages of being efficient, bright, portable and flexible.

 The ground and excited state properties of the ligands and complexes were investigated by a range of techniques, including electrochemistry, absorption and emission spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry and excited state lifetime studies. Complexes of dppz-based ligands typically show MOs which are segregated over either the bpy or phz region of the dppz backbone. The properties of the Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes of the ligand series investigated in this work were consistent with this model, and the LUMOs of these complexes were assigned as the b&#8321;(phz) phz-localised MO. The Re(I) and Cu(I) complexes of the ligand series appeared to show MOs which were delocalised over the entire dppz ligand. 
 A modular complex containing an electron transport group, hole transport group and emitting centre was synthesised. The complex fac-tricarbonyl(trans-(E)-1-((2,2&#65533;:5&#65533;,2&#65533;&#65533;-terthiophen)-3&#65533;-yl)-2-(4&#65533;-pyridyl)-ethane)(2-(11-dipyrido[3,2-a:2&#65533;,3&#65533;-c]phenazine)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole)rhenium(I) hexafluorophosphate was oxidised and reduced readily, encouraging efficient transport of both holes and electrons. However, this resulted in the complex having a small band gap and hence a low quantum yield of emission. Emission from this complex appeared to be from more than one state. 
 The complexes containing the dppz-based ligand series show complicated excited state behaviour. Emission behaviour is consistent with input from more than one state for many of the Re(I), Cu(I) and Ir(III) complexes. The Ru(II) complexes of the ligand series emit from a &#65533;MLCT state between metal-based and bpy-based MOs located on the dppz ligands, as is usual for complexes of this type. All complexes containing 11-cyanodipyrido[3,2-a:2&#65533;,3&#65533;-c]phenazine showed extremely short excited state lifetimes consistent with extremely efficient non-radiative deactivation of the excited state. 
 Ligands and complexes were incorporated into OLEDs with the structure [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:BuPBD:dopant/BCP/Alq&#8323;/LiF/Al] to test their ability to behave as emissive dyes. Many of the compounds behaved poorly as dopants due to their low emission quantum yields, and poor alignment of HOMO and LUMO energy levels with those of the other compounds within the device. &#65533;MLCT-based emission was achieved through energy transfer from the PVK host for the devices containing chlorotricarbonylrhenium(I) complexes of the ligand series. The OLEDs containing Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes also emitted from dopant-centred &#65533;MLCT states. In these devices, dopant excitation appeared to occur through direct charge trapping from the adjacent hole transport and electron transport layers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Light emitting</field><field name="subject">diodes</field><field name="subject">ligands</field><field name="subject">photoluminescence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070516.113739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, control and accountability in a voluntary organisation : the implications for professional staff and service delivery</field><field name="creator">Favell, Margaret Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Over the last decade government policy has transformed many aspects of the welfare state and contracted out to private or voluntary non-government organisations many of the services previously provided by the state. Currently there is very little research on the benefits or disadvantages regarding standards of professional practice and delivery of these services when controlled by voluntary organisations and this research is a case study investigating these concerns. 
 By using the case study method it is possible to understand issues by incorporating concrete examples of practice within the context that it takes place, as it is only when seen in its proper setting that the general and conceptual significance of practice is understood. 
 This case study explores the relationships of power, control and accountability in one such non-governmental organisation, the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society and the implications these have for professional staff in the delivery of the service. The study uses the archaeology and genealogy methods suggested by Foucault. Archival material was gained from the Minutes of the meetings of the Plunket executive (1917-1984), constitution and rules. These serve to demonstrate the historical power relationships in the organisation, Plunket nurses&#65533; working conditions and how some nurses were treated. The dominant discourse in the archaeology contains two major themes, one being volunteers&#65533; autonomous 'ownership' of the organisation, and the other, the subordination of professionalism through the discipline and management of the nursing workforce. 
 Those same themes are also dominant in the contemporary data studied in the genealogy, which highlights the constraints imposed by volunteer 'ownership' in the contemporary period. It is a feature of the "path dependency" of the organisation that the belief that volunteers had a right to discipline and control the nursing workforce has remained largely unchanged in the contemporary period. 
 The practice and the context are personalised through interviews with some nurses so that their real-life experiences may give an in-depth understanding of the processes going on for them as professionals. This is one of multiple sources of evidence, including reports, reviews and research, used to triangulate the findings. Through the totality of these methods, insight into Plunket&#65533;s decision-making is made possible. 
 These serve to underline the continuing lack of accountability for service delivery of nonprofessional 'owners' of the voluntary organisation and the negative impact it can have on the delivery of professional services although the greater depth in the contemporary data also highlights two new subsidiary themes; the dominance of lay knowledge over both professional and managerial knowledge, and volunteers&#65533; motives for volunteering. 
 The contemporary interview data demonstrated how the historical culture of the organisation enabled this process to continue through poor workplace conditions, high staff attrition and, in some cases, severe personal pressure akin to workplace bullying. 
 This study exposes the significance of the culture of organisations, and reveals that the substance of apparent altruistic voluntary organisations may be much more complex and problematic than the ideology would lead us to believe. In a field such as this, where an NGO has sole national responsibility for such an important area and where the outcomes are so poor, change must be considered. While a path dependency explanation is pessimistic about change, it is argued that the only option for professional standards of service for this, and other NGOs, lies in much more accountability and democracy in stakeholder relationships. Recommendations are made in that direction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">voluntarism</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">services</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">corporate</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">associations</field><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071003.101609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintenance of interventions in organisations</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Nadia</field><field name="description">Many successful interventions are not maintained after researchers leave an organisation at the conclusion of a study. This research was conducted to assess the magnitude of this problem and determine which variables affect intervention maintenance. Maintenance was examined in a review and analysis of 125 applicable studies published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior Management from 1977 - 1999. Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted to determine the maintenance status of their intervention. The analysis found the extent of this problem in published studies is substantial. Intervention maintenance was necessary to maintain the intervention&#65533;s effects in two thirds of studies with successful interventions. Of all studies where maintenance was necessary, approximately 40% failed to maintain the intervention. The maintenance procedures derived from the literature, researchers in the field, and journal analysis included planning for a wide range of positive outcomes, designing the intervention to be long-term, and communicating the benefits of the intervention to the organisation. For this thesis, three studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of these maintenance procedures. The first two studies partially replicated studies where the interventions had been successful but not maintained, with the inclusion of maintenance procedures. Intervention maintenance occurred in a university cafeteria in Study 1, and in one of three supermarkets in Study 2. Study 3 improved on the design and procedure of Study 2, including a manipulation of the maintenance procedures. During intervention in the control supermarket, signs designed to increase customer donations to the supermarket foodbank bin were placed on shelves near discounted items. In the experimental supermarket, both maintenance procedures and signs were used. During 6 weeks of follow-up, the signs were maintained in both supermarkets. The researcher then ceased regular observations, returning only for 1 month, 2 month, and 1 year follow-ups. After researcher presence was withdrawn, maintenance of the signs continued only in the experimental supermarket. This study demonstrates that the maintenance procedures were effective, and necessary, for long-term maintenance to occur after the researcher left the organisation. It was concluded that the maintenance procedures were effective for encouraging intervention maintenance, and recommended that researchers incorporate the procedures into their studies when maintenance is desirable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="subject">behavior modification</field><field name="subject">charity</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071015.160435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of dentine tubule infection</field><field name="creator">Parmar, Dikesh</field><field name="description">Bacteria are implicated in endodontic infections. They not only infect the root canal lumen but also invade the dentinal tubules where they may remain untouched by contemporary chemomechanical preparation during root canal therapy. The contentious issue is whether the bacteria within these tubules contribute to secondary infections. Many studies have shown that clinicians fail to completely eradicate them during root canal therapy. At present there are no techniques available to detect the effectiveness of the current chemomechanical treatment regime within dentinal tubules. 
 It is difficult to detect bacteria within the dentinal tubules. Culturing techniques have been used routinely as they are versatile and easy to use. However, they are unable to show the distribution of the bacteria within the dentinal tubules. Scanning electron microscopy, on the other hand, shows detailed surface structure in association with bacteria. Histological examination of root dentine specimens under the light microscope also shows the distribution of bacteria within the specimen but not viability. 
 The dilemma posed by these existing techniques is that the results offer limited information; either demonstrating bacterial viability or bacterial distribution within specimens. No techniques able to show both the viability and the distribution of bacteria within the dentinal tubules have been reported to date. Fluorescent stains, in particular SYTO&#65533;9 and propidium iodide (LIVE/DEAD&#65533; Baclight[TM] viability kit, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, Oregon), have made it possible not only to stain bacteria but to differentiate live and dead bacteria. The combination of these two stains has yet to be applied to dental hard tissue in situ and they provide the basis for this investigation. 
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the LIVE/DEAD&#65533; Baclight[TM] stains in conjuction with confocal laser scanning microscopy in the development of a technique to evaluate the viability and distribution of bacteria within dentinal tubules. This was extended to demonstrate the application of this technique by examining three different means of root canal disinfection both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
 An important aspect of this study was to maintain bacterial viability, as well as to get maximum bacterial invasion into dentinal tubules. Results indicated that when the root canals were instrumented with Protaper&#65533; files and then irrigated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid with cetrimide (EDTAC), there was more bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules than when the root canals were only irrigated with NaOCl and EDTAC. Daily replenishments of nutrients resulted in deeper bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules. 
 Bacteria colonized the dentinal tubules up to a distance of 594 &#65533; 133 [mu]m from the canal. In the untreated tubules, 96 &#65533; 4 % of bacteria remained viable (green-fluorescent), whereas the Amoxicillin-treated tubules contained 94 &#65533; 6 % dead (red-fluorescent) bacteria. The calcium hydroxide-treated tubules resulted in 92 &#65533; 7 % bacterial death while the laser-treated tubules contained 81 &#65533; 12 % dead cells, frequently displaying an inner zone of dead cells surrounded by an outer zone of viable cells. 
 The application of the fluorescent stains combined with confocal microscopy offers a new method for assessing the in vitro efficacy of root canal disinfection regimens.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dentin</field><field name="subject">infections</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">microtubules</field><field name="subject">oonfocal fluorescence microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071221.115951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption properties of two thermophilic bacteria</field><field name="creator">Heinrich, Hannah Tabea Monika</field><field name="description">The release of toxic metal species is of concern due to their detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Industrial effluents are a major source of mobilised metal species. Suitable technologies are needed to sequester toxic metal species at the point of source. Biosorption, which is based on the passive adsorption of contaminants onto biological materials, promises to offer an effective alternative or complementary step to existing treatment methods. However, to date there has been no widespread commercialisation of the technique. This is partly due to an insufficient understanding of the complex underlying mechanisms which makes it difficult to select suitable biomass for specific remediation problems and to predict process performance. 
 This study characterised two gram-positive, thermophilic bacteria, Anoxybacillus flavithermus (BF) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (BS), harvested at two different growth times, with regard to their acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption behaviour. The aim was to investigate the metal cation adsorption properties of thermophilic bacteria which has not been studied previously, and to gain a better understanding of the interactions responsible for bacterial metal cation adsorption. Experimental techniques employed in this study included microscopy to establish cell and cell wall morphology, batch acid-base and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption experiments to quantify proton active surface functional groups and Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption, electrophoretic mobility measurements to assess the overall surface charge of the bacteria and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy to reveal the chemical identities of functional groups. Chemical equilibrium models based on batch acid-base titration and electrophoretic mobility data were developed to quantitatively describe proton active surface functional groups. These groups can also interact with metal cations. 
 It was found that growth time was an important factor in all experiments with the differences between growth times often being more pronounced than the differences between the two bacterial strains. Microscopy revealed a gram-positive cell wall structure with different widths and staining behaviour for exponential phase cells of BF and BS. Stationary / death phase cells showed disintegrating cell walls. Acid-base titrations indicated that all cells possessed buffering capacity over the whole investigated pH range (pH 2 - 10). From electrophoretic mobility measurements, isoelectric points of ~ 3.2 for BF and &lt; 1.8 and ~ 4.2 for exponential and stationary / death phase cells of BS respectively were estimated. Chemical equilibrium models including a Donnan electrostatic model were derived which described both the batch acid-base titration data and the electrophoretic mobility data reasonably well, although a comparison with IR data suggested room for further improvement. In situ ATR-IR spectroscopy of hydrated bacterial cells at various pH values revealed amide and carboxyl groups and a contribution from phosphate / polysaccharide moieties. Group specific interactions with Cd&#65533;&#8314; were not detected, however, a partially reversible absorbance increase of all peaks suggested conformational changes in the presence of Cd&#65533;&#8314;. BF and BS adsorbed ~ 70 [mu]mol Cd&#65533;&#8314; (g dry bacterial)&#8315;&#65533; at pH 5 in 0.01 M NaNO&#8323;. Release of major cations occurred concomitantly with Cd&#65533;&#8314; adsorption. 
 The buffering and Cd&#65533;&#8314;-binding capacities of BF and BS were found to be comparable to those of mesophilic bacteria and ion exchange was identified as an important adsorption mechanism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acid-base</field><field name="subject">chemistry</field><field name="subject">thermophilic</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080107.095128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring relationships between parent companies and their subsidiaries : the case of Japanese mulitinationals</field><field name="creator">Strach, Pavel</field><field name="description">Japanese-style management and Japanese companies have been popular targets of management studies since the 1970s. Many studies have been devoted to the examination of Japanese companies in Japan. By comparison, less understanding has been achieved about how Japanese companies conduct business in their international operations and how famous Japanese management has been transferred to Japanese subsidiaries. This thesis contributes to an ongoing academic debate about the internationalization processes within Japanese multinational companies. 
 The processes involved in interaction between the parent company and subsidiaries address the research question of how subsidiaries of Japanese multinational firms perceive the relationship with their parent companies. The parent-subsidiary relationship is conceptualized within the boundaries of communication and information exchange theory. The conceptual framework creates a tool for research inquiry into the parent-subsidiary relationship. The framework conceptualizes the relationship between facilitating factors and perceived parental influence. Access to the parent company, motivation to engage with the parent company, and ability to engage with the parent company are conceptualized as factors facilitating the parent-subsidiary relationship. National/country and organizational/industry characteristics are identified as attributes moderating the relationship. Information outflow, inflow, and intraflow are derived components of the parental influence. 
 The study presented here is exploratory with findings based on two sequential comparative research stages. The Czech Republic and New Zealand, although different in terms of national and country characteristics, are argued as a suitable comparable base for conducting research within subsidiaries ofJapanese firms. In stage one, 18 Czech and 17 New Zealand subsidiaries of Japanese companies participated in a questionnaire survey. In stage two, 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted for case studies within Czech and New Zealand subsidiaries of six Japanese parent companies. The case studies provided further insights into the subsidiary-parent relationship. 
 This research seeks contribution to the internationalization literature by offering a new useful framework for the examination of the parent-subsidiary link. The self-identity of Japanese subsidiaries was found to give meaning to the parental relationship as perceived by the subsidiary. This relationship was influenced by the subsidiary&#65533;s country location, the industry in which the subsidiary operates, and the presence of expatriate management in the subsidiary. This research also found significant commonalities among the perceptions of parental influence in all Japanese subsidiaries involved in the study. The observed commonalities indicate that Japanese companies might have moved away from the internationalization processes ascribed to them by previous academic research. The change triggered by collapse of stock markets in mid-1990s has resulted to a recent reduction of expatriate staff reported little parental guidance, independence, and the strong self-identification of subsidiaries with their local environment.

While this niche has attracted attention from both researchers and marketers alike, not much knowledge has been accumulated about the tourist encounter itself. It is the main purpose of this thesis to research on-site behavioural and experiential aspects of the film location encounter. 
 For the overall research design, an inductive, comparative case-study approach was implemented. Three cases were selected for this research: The Lord of the Rings locations in New Zealand, The Sound of Music locations in Austria and Star Wars locations in Tunisia. The applied methods are participant observation, image-based data and semi-structured interviews. The data collection was conducted while participating in organised film location tows in order to secure access to the informants. 
 The first fundamental outcome of this research is that there is no 'film location tourist' as such. People who travel to film locations come from different socio-economic backgrounds, comprise all age groups and possess varying degrees of fandom. The majority of film location tourists, however, have one thing in common, regardless of the underlying movie genre: the longing to connect with the imaginary world of the film by visiting the physical and thus 'real' location places. These places are consumed in two ways: as places of spectacle and as sacred places. 
 The nature of the location consumption is dependent on a number of factors, including the degree of fandom of the consumers, the attractiveness of the encountered locations, the consistency of the interpretive community, the amount and nature of external distortions and, if applicable, the structure of the location tour. Means of consumption of film locations as spectacle are formal posing, sight recordings and shot re-creations. When experiencing film locations as sacred places, shot re-creations, mental simulations and filmic re-enactments occur. The latter form of consumption can result in a symbiosis between the imaginary and the real place component: the gazing subject becomes the previously (photographed) object. 
 Regardless of the degree of experiential satisfaction, film location tourists want to bring some of the magic back home. This is achieved not only via mental pictures and physical photographs, but also through souvenirs. These can be off- or on-site. Regarding the latter, these souvenirs are almost holy relics, brought home from a successful pilgrimage and subsequently framed and displayed in an altar-like fashion. The benefits from this are not only self-pride and satisfaction, but also the distinction to other movie fans who have not been able to do the journey themselves. Thus, the person in possession of such a relic gains privileged status amongst peers which in turn raises the satisfaction with the location encounter. 
 The film location experience cycle comes to a full closure by re-watching the movie. This procedure involves a renewed connection to both the imaginary filmic places as well as the real locations visited. The filmic gaze is extended, as the movie scenes are now seen as part of a real place which extends beyond the filmic sight.

This is because of a lack of fossil evidence and complex restructuring by anthropogenic factors, especially increased fire frequency, and more recently mammalian grazing. There is also little information regarding the effect of the lost fauna on maintaining and structuring presettlement communities, both in Central Otago and throughout the eastern South Island dryland zone. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the functioning of pre-settlement ecosystems in dryland Central Otago, particularly the role of the largest vertebrate herbivores, the moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes), and to explore the implications of the extinct fauna for land conservation management across New Zealand. 
 Late Pleistocene and Holocene vegetation communities of the Central Otago lowlands were reconstructed from plant macrofossils, including seeds, leaves, and wood, excavated from rockshelter, cave, and swamp deposits throughout the region. The macrofossils represent three main vegetation types: late Pleistocene to mid (late?) Holocene basin floor wetland herb associations, Olearia-shrublands surrounding these wetlands, and mid to late Holocene open scrubland and woodland in gorges and on low altitude slopes, dominated by filiramulate Olearia, Coprosma, and Corokia, with abundant lianes (Muehlenbeckia spp. and Rubus spp.) and understorey herbs. Many native tree and shrub species that are presently widespread in the Central Otago lowlands were rare or absent prior to anthropogenic fires (e.g. Discaria toumatou, Kunzea ericoides, Leptospermum scoparium). Other tree and shrub species once present are now extinct in the region (e.g. Coprosma obconica, Plagianthus regius, Pseudopanax ferox). The loss of these indigenous woody vegetation communities was a major factor contributing to the extirpation of many small bird species, and undoubtedly also reptile and invertebrate species, from the region. 
 Plant macrofossils from rockshelters included remains of bird nests, identifiable by desiccated feathers and eggshell amongst them. These macrofossils include the first described plant remains from the nests of moa, which were constructed from a shallow bed of twigs of locally available shrubs and lianes. Many of the twigs are 25-30 mm in length and show evidence of having been clipped by moa bills. 
 Desiccated coprolites, mostly of moa, but also specimens attributed to Finsch&#65533;s duck (Chenonetta finschi) and red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae), were recovered from rockshelter excavations. Moa species associated with a sample of coprolites were identified using ancient DNA analysis, and plant macrofossils from these were examined, together with previously unexamined moa gizzard content samples excavated from mires in the eastern South Island dryland zone. The results indicate that, in addition to previously reported browsing, upland moa (Megalapteryx didinus) and heavy-footed moa (Pachyornis elephantopus) also functioned as grazers, and seeds in their coprolites are dominantly of low shrubs and ground-cover herbs. Of particular interest was the higher than expected frequency of seeds from the currently rare and threatened 'spring annual' herbs; Ceratocephala pungens and Myosurus minimus subsp. novae-zelandiae (Ranunculaceae), suggesting further research on potential ecological relationships between moa and these plants would be worthwhile. The results of this study have provided a baseline for future conservation and restoration projects in the Central Otago lowlands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Central Otago District</field><field name="subject">paleoecology</field><field name="subject">arid regions ecology</field><field name="subject">fossil birds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080211.142212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheology of the Alpine Fault Mylonite Zone : deformation processes at and below the base of the seismogenic zone in a major plate boundary structure</field><field name="creator">Toy, Virginia Gail</field><field name="description">The Alpine Fault is the major structure of the Pacific-Australian plate boundary through New Zealand&#65533;s South Island. During dextral reverse fault slip, a &lt;5 million year old, ~1 km thick mylonite zone has been exhumed in the hanging-wall, providing unique exposure of material deformed to very high strains at deep crustal levels under boundary conditions constrained by present-day plate motions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the fault zone rheology and mechanisms of strain localisation, to obtain further information about how the structural development of this shear zone relates to the kinematic and thermal boundary constraints, and to investigate the mechanisms by which the viscously deforming mylonite zone is linked to the brittle structure, that fails episodically causing large earthquakes. 
 This study has focussed on the central section of the fault from Harihari to Fox Glacier. In this area, mylonites derived from a quartzofeldspathic Alpine Schist protolith are most common, but slivers of Western Province-derived footwall material, which can be differentiated using mineralogy and bulk rock geochemistry, were also incorporated into the fault zone. These footwall-derived mylonites are increasingly common towards the north. 
 At amphibolite-facies conditions mylonitic deformation was localised to the mylonite and ultramylonite subzones of the schist-derived mylonites. Most deformation was accommodated by dislocation creep of quartz, which developed strong Y-maximum crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) patterns by prism (a) dominant slip. Formation of this highly-oriented fabric would have led to significant geometric softening and enhanced strain localisation. During this high strain deformation, pre-existing Alpine Schist fabrics in polyphase rocks were reconstituted to relatively well-mixed, finer-grained aggregates. As a result of this fabric homogenisation, strong syn-mylonitic object lineations were not formed. Strain models show that weak lineations trending towards ~090&#65533; and kinematic directions indicated by asymmetric fabrics and CPO pattern symmetry could have formed during pure shear stretches up-dip of the fault of ~3.5, coupled with simple shear strains [greater than or equal to]30. The preferred estimate of simple:pure shear strain gives a kinematc vorticity number, W[k] [greater than or equal to]&#818; 0.9997. 
 Rapid exhumation due to fault slip resulted in advection of crustal isotherms. New thermobarometric and fluid inclusion analyses from fault zone materials allow the thermal gradient along an uplift path in the fault rocks to be more precisely defined than previously. Fluid inclusion data indicate temperatures of 325+&#818;15&#65533;C were experienced at depths of ~45 km, so that a high thermal gradient of ~75&#65533;C km&#8315;&#65533; is indicated in the near-surface. This gradient must fall off to [ less than approximately]l0&#65533;C km&#8315;&#65533; below the brittle-viscous transition since feldspar thermobarometry, Ti-inbiotite thermometry and the absence of prism(c)-slip quartz CPO fabrics indicate deformation temperatures did not exceed ~ 650&#65533;C at [greater than or equal to] 7.0-8.5&#65533;1.5 kbar, ie. 26-33 km depth. 
 During exhumation, the strongly oriented quartzite fabrics were not favourably oriented for activation of the lower temperature basal(a) slip system, which should have dominated at depths [less than approximately]20 km. Quartz continued to deform by crystal-plastic mechanisms to shallow levels. However, pure dislocation creep of quartz was replaced by a frictional-viscous deformation mechanism of sliding on weak mica basal planes coupled with dislocation creep of quartz. Such frictional-viscous flow is particularly favoured during high-strain rate events as might be expected during rupture of the overlying brittle fault zone. Maximum flow stresses supported by this mechanism are ~65 Mpa, similar to those indicated by recrystallised grain size paleopiezometry of quartz (D&gt;25[mu]m, indicating [Delta][sigma][max] ~55 MPa for most mylonites). It is likely that the preferentially oriented prism (a) slip system was activated during these events, so the Y-maximum CPO fabrics were preserved. Simple numerical models show that activation of this slip system is favoured over the basal (a) system, which has a lower critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) at low temperatures, for aggregates with strong Y-maximum orientations. Absence of pervasive crystal-plastic deformation of micas and feldspars during activation of this mechanism also resulted in preservation of mineral chemistries from the highest grades of mylonitic deformation (ie. amphibolite-facies). 
 Retrograde, epidote-amphibolite to greenschist-facies mineral assemblages were pervasively developed in ultramylonites and cataclasites immediately adjacent to the fault core and in footwall-derived mylonites, perhaps during episodic transfer of this material into and subsequently out of the cooler footwall block. In the more distal protomylonites, retrograde assemblages were locally developed along shear bands that also accommodated most of the mylonitic deformation in these rocks. Ti-in-biotite thermometry suggests biotite in these shear bands equilibrated down to ~500+&#818;50&#65533;C, suggesting crystal-plastic deformation of this mineral continued to these temperatures. Crossed-girdle quartz CPO fabrics were formed in these protomylonites by basal (a) dominant slip, indicating a strongly oriented fabric had not previously formed at depth due to the relatively small strains, and that dislocation creep of quartz continued at depths [less than or equal to]20 km. Lineation orientations, CPO fabric symmetry and shear-band fabrics in these protomylonites are consistent with a smaller simple:pure shear strain ratio than that observed closer to the fault core (W[k] [greater than approximately] 0.98), but require a similar total pure shear component. Furthermore, they indicate an increase in the simple shear component with time, consistent with incorporation of new hanging-wall material into the fault zone. Pre-existing lineations were only slowly rotated into coincidence with the mylonitic simple shear direction in the shear bands since they lay close to the simple shear plane, and inherited orientations were not destroyed until large finite strains (&lt;100) were achieved. 
 As the fault rocks were exhumed through the brittle-viscous transition, they experienced localised brittle shear failures. These small-scale seismic events formed friction melts (ie. pseudotachylytes). The volume of pseudotachylyte produced is related to host rock mineralogy (more melt in host rocks containing hydrated minerals), and fabric (more melt in isotropic host rocks). Frictional melting also occurred within cataclastic hosts, indicating the cataclasites around the principal slip surface of the Alpine Fault were produced by multiple episodes of discrete shear rather than distributed cataclastic flow. Pseudotachylytes were also formed in the presence of fluids, suggesting relatively high fault gouge permeabilities were transiently attained, probably during large earthquakes. Frictional melting contributed to formation of phyllosilicate-rich fault gouges, weakening the brittle structure and promoting slip localisation. The location of faulting and pseudotachylyte formation, and the strength of the fault in the brittle regime were strongly influenced by cyclic hydrothermal cementation processes. 
 A thermomechanical model of the central Alpine Fault zone has been defined using the results of this study. The mylonites represent a localised zone of high simple shear strain, embedded in a crustal block that underwent bulk pure shear. The boundaries of the simple shear zone moved into the surrounding material with time. This means that the exhumed sequence does not represent a simple 'time slice' illustrating progressive fault rock development during increasing simple shear strains. The deformation history of the mylonites at deep crustal P-T conditions had a profound influence on subsequent deformation mechanisms and fabric development during exhumation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">Alpine Fault</field><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">faults (geology)</field><field name="subject">mylonite</field><field name="subject">plate tectonics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080305.110949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing compound-specific stable isotope tools for monitoring landfill leachate</field><field name="creator">Benbow, Timothy J</field><field name="description">This thesis has developed a suite of compound specific stable isotope tools to monitor landfill leachate and identify the infiltration of leachate to ground water and surface water. These tools have the power to indicate the fractional contribution multiple discrete sources of pollution are making to a single location. This journey began by developing two solid phase extraction (SPE) methods to extract non-polar and polar organic compounds from leachate with minimal fractionation of hydrogen or carbon isotopes. Non-polar compounds were successfully extracted using ENV+ SPE cartridges and polar compounds were successfully extracted using Strata-X SPE cartridges. The isotopic fractionation of non-polar compounds during ENV+ extraction varied significantly (up to 245&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; and 1.8&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; for D and &#65533;&#65533;C respectively, when eluted with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate, as recommended by manufacturers) but the fractionation of compounds eluted with dichloromethane was negligible (less than instrumental precision). Polar compounds were eluted from Strata-X cartridges with negligible isotopic fractionation using methanol. The direct comparison of SPE and liquid-liquid extraction found SPE to extract slightly more compound from leachate then liquid-liquid extraction (especially for polar compounds) and the isotopic compositions of compounds did not change with extraction methods. 
 These new analytical methods subsequently were used to determine the isotopic compositions of organic compounds dissolved in leachates from three New Zealand landfills. The molecular and isotopic signature of leachate varied significantly between landfills, indicating the isotopic fingerprint of organic compounds in leachate is unsuitable as a universal tracer of leachate. However, compounds such as terpien-4-ol, methylethylbenzene and juvabione maintained their isotopic composition over short geographical distance-indicating their potential as site-specific tracers of leachate. Organic compounds analysed on a transect across the landfill boundary indicated polar compounds were more mobile than semi-volatile compounds and possessed a more conservative isotopic composition. However, hexadecanoic acid extracted from leachate and ground water was highly depleted in &#65533;&#65533;C (-72 &#8304;/&#8320;&#8320; to -40&#8304;/&#8320;&#8320;), indicative of methanogenic and sulfate reducing bacteria. These bacteria only live in highly reducing environments such as leachate; therefore their presence in the pristine environment can potentially indicate the release of leachate from the landfill. 
 The final experiments traced the uptake and utilisation of leachate by periphyton. The isotopic composition of bulk periphyton, fatty acids and phytol indicated that microbial assimilation and utilisation of nutrients is a complex process. Fatty acid biomarkers for green algae and diatoms showed signs of leachate derived nutrients, however the availability of nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, water and light) caused significant changes in metabolic processes and isotopic compositions. Under slow growing conditions, the [delta]&#65533;&#65533;C composition of periphyton became enriched in &#65533;&#65533;C as solar irradiation levels decreased (including shading by detritus and periphyton), while the [delta]D composition of fatty acid was controlled by the internal recycling of hydrogen. This study indicated the power of compound specific isotope analysis as a tool to detect the release of landfill leachate from a landfill, especially at locations with multiple potential sources of contaminants, and provides a sound platform for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stable isotope tracers</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080314.111826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing the impact of decision complexity in ambulance command and control</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Jared</field><field name="description">The overriding goal of this work was to present information to ambulance command and control (AC2) operators in a manner that complemented their dispatchers decision making processes whilst minimising the effects of a number of identified complexities. It was theorised that presenting information in this manner would improve the decision making performance of the dispatchers. The initial stages of this work involved identifying the strategies that AC2 operators use when making decisions regarding the allocation of ambulances to emergency incidents and the complexities associated with these decisions. These strategies were identified after the analysis of interviews with AC2 operators using an interview approach called the Critical Decision Method. The subsequent analysis of the interview transcripts using an Emergent Themes Analysis provided a significant number of insights regarding the decision making processes of the operators and the information required to support these decisions. Of particular significance was the importance of situation awareness in the decision making process. For example, when dispatchers have a sound understanding of incidents and additional factors such as the ambulances under their control, the dispatch decision becomes less complicated. 
 To extend the understanding of the dispatcher&#65533;s work in the communication centres, a number of factors that could contribute to the complexity of the dispatch task were identified from an additional analysis of the interview transcripts. However it was not possible to establish from this the contribution of these factors to the perceived complexity encountered by the operators. To address this, a questionnaire was circulated requiring dispatchers to rate the contribution of a number of factors to the complexity of the dispatch task and the frequency that these factors occurred. The results showed that the most prevalent factors related to a number of the cognitive processes that the dispatchers performed to manage the dispatch task. Such processes included determining the resource most likely to arrive at the scene of an emergency incident the quickest. There were also differences in regard to which areas of the dispatch process the dispatchers in the two centres considered to be the most complex. 
 The final stage of this research was the design of a prototype interface that complemented the decision making strategies used by the dispatchers and addressed the identified complexities. At this stage the scope of the research was narrowed to focus primarily on the resource assessment and allocation phases of the dispatch process and several of the complexities associated with these. The prototype interface made use of a novel display technology that allowed the presentation of information across two overlapping LCD displays (referred to as a Multi Layered Display (MLD)). To test the effectiveness of this display a laboratory experiment was conducted comparing the perfomance of participants using the MLD with participants using a Single Layered Display (SLD) that presented the same information. The results indicated that in almost all cases the participants using the multi layer display performed better. However these differences did not prove to be significant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ambulance service</field><field name="subject">decision making</field><field name="subject">dispatching</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="subject">emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.160620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes and effects of cardiovascular strain in the heat</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Shawnda A</field><field name="description">Passive and active heat loading causes cardiovascular strain, which can have diverse and substantial effects. Thus, cardiovascular function is integral to work and heat stress tolerance, but recent hyperthermia and exercise literature has not emphasised this relationship, instead focusing on the roles of upper &#65533;critical&#65533; core temperature or rate of heat storage as primary mechanisms of fatigue. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to examine some potential causes and effects of cardiovascular strain under heat stress, including potential strategies for attenuating that strain. 
 Body precooling before exercise increases heat storage capacity; the primary mechanism by which attenuations in thermal and cardiovascular strain, and improved work capacity is thought to occur. However, no precooling study has utilised realistic airflow in the laboratory, possibly inflating its purported benefits. Therefore, Study One examined the cardiovascular, thermal, psychophysical and ergogenic effects of precooling with and without airflow in the heat (30&#65533;C, 50% rh). Ten males completed four trials in balanced order, comprising 60- min immersion in thermoneutral (35&#65533;C) or cool (24&#65533;C) water before cycling at 95% ventilatory threshold with airflow (~4.8 m&#65533;s&#8315;&#65533;) or no airflow, until exhaustion. Heart rate and mean core, body, and skin temperatures were attenuated for 15 min into cycling after precooling. Endurance time was extended by 30 &#65533; 23 min with airflow, and 16 &#65533; 15 min with precooling relative to control (28 &#65533; 12 min) but not further extended with strategies combined (29 &#65533; 21 min). Precooling removed 784 &#65533; 223 kJ&#65533;m&#8315;&#65533; (calorimetrically); less than the effect of airflow alone (1323 &#65533; 1128 kJ&#65533;m&#8315;&#65533;). 
 Competition for blood between tissues is pronounced during exercise in the heat: skin and gut have marked increases and decreases, respectively. Gut ischemia affects epithelial tight junction integrity, allowing lippopolysaccharide ingress and immune responses. Bovine colostrum may attenuate gut permeability. Study Two (double-blind, placebo controlled) investigated the effects of aerobic fitness (7 highly fit, 8 moderately fit) and bovine colostrum on physiological and perceived strain, and performance during mixed-mode exercise; cycle 15 min at 50% maximal heart rate range (HRR), run 30 min at 80% HRR then 30 min self-selected paced before another 15 min cycle at the same work-rate. Airflow was graded to running speed. During the last cycle, blood pressure, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance were lower, heart rate and skin blood flow increased, and skin temperature was unchanged compared to the first cycle. Indices of fever response (IL-1&#946;, TNF-&#945;) were not evident during exercise, nor were those of blood-brain barrier permeability (S100&#946;) or cognitive impairment (Stroop test). Neither bovine colostrum, nor higher fitness modified these measures. 
 Moving to upright posture is orthostatically stressful and can initially decrease cerebral perfusion. Compression garments are used to assist venous return; while their effectiveness is unknown, they could reduce heat or orthostatic-induced hypoperfusion. Study Three investigated the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses to orthostatic stress with and without passive heating (+0.5&#65533;C). Fifteen participants completed two trials (compression v placebo garments) in balanced order. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed via 3-min stand, and via thigh cuff inflation. All participants experienced initial orthostatic hypotension upon standing in one or more trials, with 4/15 individuals experiencing presyncopal symptoms, aborting the standing protocol. In those who "fainted", reductions in blood pressure and partial pressure of end-tidal CO&#8322; reduced middle cerebral artery velocity. Neither training status nor compression trousers modified the responses. 
 Collectively, cardiovascular strain to heat stress is attenuated when realistic airflow is provided. Increased cardiovascular strain does not inevitably result in clinical outcomes to heat stress. Higher fitness does not necessarily attenuate cardiovascular responses or higher tolerance to heat stress.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress (physiology)</field><field name="subject">homeostasis</field><field name="subject">effect of heat</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="subject">physiological effect</field><field name="subject">cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080404.162058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Without motion there cannot be any life : the rise &amp; fall of the 1889 Railway Commissioners : railway management &amp; colonial politics in nineteenth century New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Bruce H</field><field name="description">In the nineteenth century, the steam railway became, for many people, the superior conduit for the inland translocation of people and freight. Once devised, steam railways offered such a huge improvement on previous modes and made such a dramatic change to the unity, organisation and commerce of most countries that almost everyone wanted one. New Zealand proved no different, but was faced with not only the twin problems of low population and often rugged geography, but also serious economic problems from difficult world trading conditions and a debt greatly increased by railway construction costs. In the later 1880s, a conservative government decided to vest the Government Railways in independent Commissioners to try to improve productivity and cut out political influence, corruption and jobbery in the huge commercial presence the colony&#65533;s railways represented. While this move was successful, a change to one-man-one-vote, together with the pivotal 1890 Maritime Strike, saw the country move left in the elections of 1890, bringing to power a Liberal Government. This new Ministry then set out to reduce the autonomy of the Railway Commissioners, taking four years to return the management of Railways to the direct control of the Government. 
 While interesting in itself, this is part of the story of the process of the democratic development of New Zealand. This was a community struggling with the often conflicting demands of using railways to not only service the railway debt but also fulfil public transit requirements, including encouraging settlement and economic growth. The organisation&#65533;s monopolistic nature and great economic presence, however, offered multiple, including corrupt, opportunities to support the political aspirations of those in power, while offering a less than wonderful service to its customers. Taking place against a backdrop of agitation for railway reform, particularly orchestrated by railway activist Samuel Vaile, the outcome can be seen to have been less than completely desirable for the economic development of the country or its people. This was despite huge support for the principal activist against the Railway Commissioners, Liberal Premier Richard Seddon.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Railways</field><field name="subject">railways</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070619.154352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand fossil penguins : origin, pattern, and process</field><field name="creator">Ando, Tatsuro</field><field name="description">Penguins are middle- to large-sized sea birds and are widely distributed in the Southern Hemisphere. They have completely lost the capability for the aerial flight, but are highly efficient wing-propelled swimmers and divers. They have a long fossil record over 60 million years, and their origin could possibly extend back to the late Cretaceous. This study aims to elaborate the course of penguin evolution and driving force of changes based on fossil records of penguins. Numerous fossil penguin specimens have been collected and studied from New Zealand, Antarctica, South America, Australia, and Africa. Studies on fossil penguins have spanned about 150 years history since Huxley (1859). 
 Previous works on fossil penguins have achieved excellent results, but at the same time, left considerable confusion on taxonomy and anatomical interpretation, mainly because of the poor nature of the penguin fossils in early studies. Examination of newly found materials and updated evaluation of previously studied materials are needed, using modern methods. 
 During about 150 years of fossil penguins study since Huxley1859, more than 40 genera and 70 species have been described. The number of specimens listed in the published literature amounts to more than 1300. Chapter II reviews all those fossil penguins in a summarised and consistent style, aiming to present the taxonomy used in this study as a primary and essential resource for research. The chapter also provides other information on fossil penguins, such as geological data and an assessment of the skeletal association of the specimens referred to a species. 
 Chapter III introduces the osteology of penguins, by describing and comparing the skeletal characteristics and variation of both extant and fossil species. Though previous works on penguins osteology are extensive, the interpretation of the homology, and resulted terminology, are occasionally inappropriate, or incorrect, because of the highly-specialised structure. Many of the new, yet undescribed, fossils prompt a comprehensive update of those previous studies, to understand the nature of morphological variation in penguins, and to correct or clarify confusion in previous works. 
 The New Zealand fossil penguin fauna is one of the most significant for fossil penguin studies, but there are many undescribed fossil penguin specimens. Chapter IV provides accounts of such materials. Chapter IV also reviews previously-described New Zealand fossil penguins, usually re-evaluated using new materials. This chapter includes reassessment of the controversial, first-described fossil penguin Palaeeudyptes antarcticus, description of an enigmatic new species (Pakudyptes hakataramea gen. et sp. nov.) which could elucidate the evolutionary pattern of the penguin wing, description of new materials of Platydyptes revealing a unique structure and functional interpretation, and redescriptions with functional interpretation of Pachydyptes and Archaeospheniscus. 
 Published relationships within penguins have not been adequately discussed but stated within rather rough frameworks, so that the relationships within penguins were unclear. Chapter V provides an explicit framework for the phylogeny of penguins. Osteology-based cladistic analysis was performed to seek out the relationships within penguins, using observations on both extant and fossil penguins. There are several important grades in penguin history, which are structurally distant from each other. Results also agree with the published views in which the extant penguins form a rigid group, but Simpson&#65533;s subfamily groupings are only partly supported. A postulated phylogenetic tree includes all known fossil penguin taxa including un-named ones. 
 Chapter VI, as a synthesis of contents of previous chapters, provides a broad interpretation of penguin evolution through the Cenozoic: origin, body size increase, demise of 'giant penguins', and the emergence of modern penguins. The chapter gives a global picture of the interaction of penguins, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and temperature and sea-level change. Two main sections are: 'Origin of penguins' and 'Evolutionary process of penguins.' The loss of aerial flight and increase of body size were possibly triggered by the K/T mass extinction event which drastically reduced the predatory pressure for early penguins. The 'giant penguins' survived until the Late Oligocene but declined as the oceans modernised, and new forms of whales with advanced feeding function appeared. There is controversy about appearance of modern penguins. The fossil-based hypothesis (relatively recent origin for crown-penguins) contradicts the molecular-based one (ancient origin for crown penguins), though 'hard evidence' at present does not easily refute either hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">penguins</field><field name="subject">fossils</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080204.140701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced numerical modelling in dental research</field><field name="creator">Ichim, Ionut P</field><field name="description">The understanding of the masticatory apparatus including its functional and structural relationship with other components of the cranium increasingly requires an interdisciplinary approach. Recently, "traditional biological sciences" such as anatomy, comparative biology, anthropology and evolution have increasingly meshed with elements from other domains, such as mechanical engineering and material sciences, which has resulted in new and exciting paradigms to be explored. This is particularly true in the field of craniofacial biomechanics yet there are still many unexplored issues and numerous questions that remain unanswered. Numerical modelling in general and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in particular, represent a numerical experimental procedure to generate such information. Originally derived from the field of structural engineering, FEA has steadily permeated its way into craniofacial biomechanics and has proven itself as a most useful scientific tool. 
 The present study introduces an engineering-based workframe for applying FEA to craniofacial biomechanical research in a comprehensive manner to cover the entire analytical spectrum, from developing questions to providing their solutions. The study is composed of two major experimental parts addressing both the linear elastic and the non-linear behaviour of some biomaterials encountered in the craniofacial arena. In the first part I analysed mandibular biomechanics using linear elastic models while in the second part I used nonlinear discrete models to determine the optimal elastic properties of the cervical restorative materials. 
 Modern humans have a number of anatomical features that set us apart from our ancestors. Amongst these perhaps the most striking is the emergence of a protruding chin, otherwise absent in other archaic humans and hominids. While it has been shown that the chin has its embryological origins in the postnatal remodelling of bone in the area around the mandibular symphysis which produces the midline keel in the form of an inverted &#65533;T&#65533; the functional significance of this novel evolutionary feature is still obscure. 
 It is accepted that the mandible is optimally designed for resisting masticatory stress, whereby optimal is seen as maximual strength at the lowest biological cost. Here, I tested the currently most accepted theory, namely that the chin provides mechanical resistance to the mandible during mastication. In other words, I tested the hypothesis that a chinned mandible would be stiffer and hence experience lower strains when compared to a non-chinned counterpart under identical loadings. My functional analysis consisted firstly of three simple models which reproduce a simian shelf, a flat and a chinned symphysis, loaded using two unidirectional loadcases (torsion and wishboning) to represent a distortion similar to that which occurs in the mandible during mastication. Secondly, I developed complex geometrical models which incorporated the cortical bone, medullary bone and teeth. The models were then analysed using the same loadcases as those used for the first theoretical models. Additionally, I incorporated the coronal bending and also a coupled loadcase which simulated the complex deformation of the mandible during biting. The aim here was to test the hypothesis that the presence of a chin changed the strain pattern in the mastication-loaded mandible. The results were then interpreted using Frost&#65533;s mechanostat theory which relates in a more precise manner the mechanical loading environment to the adaptive response of the bone. My results showed that the calculated strain values for both the chinned and flat mandibles were within the normal bone maintenance levels of the mechanostat during molar biting. In other words, variation in bone strain magnitude across the mandible, which should differ between the chinned and the non-chinned mandibles if the hypothetical mechanical role of the chin is true, is similar in both forms. I concluded that the development of the human chin is thus unrelated to the functional demands placed upon it by mastication. 
 I suggested a new functional demand associated with pronounced tongue activity during speech. I hypothesise that it is the resistance to stresses induced by strong, repetitive contractions of the tongue and perioral musculature during, phonation that shaped the modern human chin. I tested my hypothesis by loading the symphyseal region with two principal nonmasticatory, muscle systems; firstly, the tongue and secondly the peri-oral muscular curtain, anterior to the symphysis. My results suggested that the flat, non-chinned symphysis when subjected to speech-related genioglossal movements will undergo adaptive changes which would result in an optimised (chinned) shape, such as that found in the modern human symphysis. 
 These results thus offer a new foundation to an old hypothesis and a solution to the longstanding controversy over the origin of the human chin. I conclude that forces generated by speech rather than those generated by mastication, shaped the chin in anatomically modern humans. 
 Prompted by an earlier observation I further investigated the apparent cross-over distribution of strains on the mandibular corpora during mastication. In doing so, I tested the hypothesis that this cross-over may be linked with another particular anatomical feature of the mandible that of the postcanine cortical asymmetry, which appears to be stereotypical among anthropoids. The results of my study hence suggest that strain patterns within the human mandible are more complex than previously thought. Not only do strains differ between lingual and buccal aspects of working and non-working sides, but they also differ within these areas (i.e. from alveolus to corpus, to lower border regions). I conclude that postcanine cortical asymmetry may be a retained evolutionary trait rather than the result of masticatory biomechanics. 
 In the second section of the thesis I introduced a different analysis regime which allows the prediction of fracture initiation and propagation. In this part I analysed the mechanics underlying the failure of the restorations placed in non-carious cervical lesions and suggested changes in the material properties of the restorations used to treat them. 
 Non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) include those entities characterised by the cervical loss of hard dental tissue that occurs in the absence of any carious process. To distinguish between lesions that occur due to excessive occlusal load and other non-carious cervical lesion (i.e. erosion and abrasion) the clinical term "abfraction" has been adopted. Although a common clinical issue, failure of restoration placed in these lesions has not been subjected to a rigorous biomechanical analysis. 
 To determine which of the material&#65533;s parameters should be changed and to what extent, I employed a combined numerical approach. 
 Here I introduced a novel approach in simulating the cracking of restorative materials and tooth tissues which is based on a simpler material formulation and can be used in an advanced nonlinear numerical analysis. The material model I used allows automatic crack insertion and growth and also uniquely accounts for the microdamage which precedes the instalment of macroscopic cracks. 
 The first step was to balance the factors that may affect failure employing a linear analysis with a stress-based approach to failure. Here, the aim was to investigate the influence of lesion shape and depth as well as the direction of occlusal loading on the mechanical response of the cervical glass-ionomer cements restoration in a lower first premolar. This analysis showed that the direction of loading was the major contributor to the failure of the restoration. 
 The next step was to apply this fracture model to the restorations of the NCCL in order to verify if the material is able to accurately simulate the location and type of mechanical failure. The data for this problem, i.e. the geometry and the loadcase were derived from the conclusions of linear analysis, that is I chose the "worst case scenario" as the upper boundary of material endurance. My results showed that under the action of para-functional loadings the GIC failed on the cervical margin. I also showed that prior to fracture the restorative material undergoes strain softening, which in turn introduces damage and weakens the materials involved. After successfully testing the proposed model, the final step was to determine which material properties and restorative techniques would be most reliable under given biomechanical conditions. The present work relied on the hypothesis that a more flexible material would partially buffer the local stress concentration and hence reduce the likelihood of mechanical failure of the restoration. 
 My study, a first of its kind, proposes a radical approach to address the problems of material improvement, namely: numerical-based material optimisation engineering. That is, I aimed to identify the "most favourable" selection of elastic modulus or E value for the restorative material, which will allow it to survive under the unfavourable occlusal loading conditions that may prevail. Two filling techniques were considered; firstly a single bulk material, namely glass-ionomer (GIC) and secondly a layered technique. The latter consisted of a layer of GIC supporting a composite bulk restorative. I chose two thicknesses for the GIC layer, 50 and 150 microns. My results showed that the restorative materials currently used in cervical non-carious lesions are largely unsuitable in terms of resistance to fracture of the restoration mostly because of their relative high stiffness irrespective of the filling technique. The best results are obtained for a bulk filling with a 1GPa elastic modulus material case in which the tensile stresses are about 50% of the failure limit. This approach in determining the mechanical properties of the restorative is novel and unique so far in the dental literature. The direct benefit of this study was the improvement of the restorative material, as it can be engineered to withstand the conditions identified as major cause of failure. This is consonant with the call for new materials better tailored for some specific needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">numerical analysis</field><field name="subject">dentistry</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">structural optimization</field><field name="subject">craniometry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080605.133323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological studies on the mechanism of action of the novel antiepileptic drug lacosamide</field><field name="creator">Errington, Adam C</field><field name="description">Lacosamide (LCM) is a new antiepileptic drug with a previously unknown mode of action.

 In a 4-aminopyridine model of tonic-clonic seizures in rat visual cortex in vitro, LCM stereoselectively reduced maximal frequency and duration of tonic activity with EC[50&#65533;s] of 71 and 41 [mu]M respectively. LCM (100 [mu]M) significantly reduced excitability in whole cell patch clamped neurons producing non-selective reduction in the incidence of excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; LCM: 46.1 &#65533; 15.5 %, P &lt;0.01, n = 4, IPSCs; LCM: 24.9 &#65533; 9.6 %, P &lt;0.01, n = 4) and block of spontaneous action potentials (EC&#8325;&#8320; 61 [mu]M). The inhibitory effects of LCM did not result from changes in passive membrane properties (including resting membrane potential or input resistance) as assessed by application of voltage ramps between -70 to +20 mV. LCM did not mimic the effects of diazepam as an allosteric modulator of GABA[A] receptor currents, nor did it inhibit evoked excitatory currents mediated by AMPA or NMDA receptors. Unlike phenytoin (DPH), carbamazepine (CBZ) or lamotrigine (LTG) that blocked sustained action potential firing evoked by brief depolarising steps (750 ms) or ramps (-70 to 20 mV, 90 mV.sec&#8315;&#65533;), LCM could weakly reduce the frequency of action potentials evoked by brief depolarisation suggesting a potential interaction with VGSCs. In accordance with this, the effect of LCM upon neurotransmission was negated in the presence of tetrodotoxin (200 nM, TTX). The frequency of miniature EPSCs was not altered by the drug (100 [mu]M). These results discounted some crucial potential anticonvulsant targets for LCM but implied a potential interaction with electrogenic VGSCs. 
 When SRF duration was prolonged (10 s) LCM produced significant (P &lt;0.01, n = 4-10, EC&#8325;&#8320;: 48 [mu]M) inhibition, but not within the first second of the burst EC&#8325;&#8320;: 640 [mu]M). Evoked TTX sensitive sodium currents in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were significantly reduced by LCM, CBZ, LTG and DPH when V[h]: -60 mV. Hyperpolarizing pulses (500 ms) to -100 mV could reverse block by CBZ, LTG and DPH but not LCM. The V&#8325;&#8320; for steady state fast inactivation was more hyperpolarized by CBZ (-79.45 &#65533; 2.64 mV, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001), LTG (-72.30 &#65533; 1.70 mV, n = 6, P &lt;0.05) and DPH (-77.17 &#65533; 2.32 mV, n = 6, P &lt;0.05) but not by LCM (-65.02 &#65533; 1.75 mV, n = 6, CONTROL: -65.84 &#65533; 0.86 mV). In contrast to CBZ, LCM did not slow recovery from fast inactivation or produce frequency dependent facilitation of block of a 3 s, 10 Hz pulse train. LCM (100 [mu]M) did produce a (V&#8325;&#8320;: CONTROL ~64 mV, LCM -57.47 &#65533; 4.53 mV, P &lt;0.001, n = 4-8) hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of slow sodium channel inactivation and promoted channel entry into the slow inactivated state (P &lt;0.001, n = 6) but did not alter the rate of recovery. I therefore conclude that LCM produces inhibition of epileptiform cellular activity, at least in part, via enhancement of voltage gated sodium channel slow inactivation and represents a molecule possessing a unique anticonvulsant mechanism of action.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anticonvulsants</field><field name="subject">mechanism of action</field><field name="subject">epilepsy</field><field name="subject">chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Lacosamide</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080613.162038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological effects in the rat basal ganglia following systemic adenosine A2A receptor stimulation and dopamine D2 receptor blockade</field><field name="creator">Voicu, Cristian</field><field name="description">The difficulty with movement initiation, or akinesia, is a cardinal symptom of Parkinson&#65533;s disease (PD) and the loss of dopaminergic cells, affecting the function of the basal ganglia, the thalamus and the motor cortex, has long been documented. From a broader perspective, it has been proposed that akinesia is caused by impaired function in different brain areas, inside and outside the basal ganglia, operating as a &#65533;behavioural arrest control system&#65533; (Klemm, 2001). Several neurotransmitters seem to modulate the activity of this system and, contrasting the well-known effects of dopamine, the involvement of adenosine has only recently emerged, particularly via A2A receptors. Adenosine plays an opposite role to dopamine in the brain: adenosine stimulation at A2A receptors inhibits movement (Ferre et al., 1991a; Hauber and Munkle, 1995; Rimondini et al., 1997), whereas A2A antagonists seem to promote movement (Kanda et al., 2000; Bara-Jimenez et al., 2003; Pinna et al., 2005). Although specific adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptors are known to antagonistically interact (Ferre et al., 1997; Fuxe et al., 1998; Ferre et al., 2001), little is known of the involvement of A2A receptors in regulating neural activity in the basal ganglia, a crucial point for the future use of A2A antagonists as adjuvant therapy in Parkinson&#65533;s disease. In fact, although it is generally accepted that akinesia results from altered function in the cortico-basal ganglia-cortical loop, as confirmed in several studies reporting changes in basal ganglia activity following dopamine depletion (Blandini et al., 2000; Bevan et al., 2002; Boraud et al., 2002), no study to date has systematically investigated electrophysiological changes in the basal ganglia during akinesia induced by adenosine receptor stimulation. 
 Starting from a common behavioural effect, this study tries to bridge this gap by investigating and comparing, in two basal ganglia structures, the neural substrate of akinesia after acute dopamine D2 receptor blockade and adenosine A2A receptor stimulation. The external segment of the globus pallidus (GP, or simply globus pallidus in the rat) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) were chosen as the recording sites because both nuclei are included into the &#65533;behavioural arrest control system&#65533; and seem to express somewhat complementary functions, as a respective key integrative station and main output of the basal ganglia. Dopamine function was manipulated by acute decrease in availability of dopamine binding sites in the brain, through specific dopamine D2 receptor blockade with systemic injections (1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg) of raclopride(3,5-dichloro-N-[(1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-y)methyl]-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-benzamide), resulting in akinesia. Conversely, movement was inhibited by specific adenosine A2A receptor stimulation with systemic injections (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) of the drug CGS21680 (sodium-2-p-carboxyethylphenylamino-5-N-carboxamidoadenosine). In both situations, behaviour was assessed through specific akinesia tests. Single neuron activity before injection and changes in the firing frequency and firing pattern occurring after injection have been analysed and compared for each cell recorded from GP and SNr, during periods of behavioural rest. Synchronised firing between cell pairs has also been assessed. However, the small number of cell pairs showing correlated firing in each structure after systemic injection of drugs was not statistically relevant for further analysis and interpretation of synchronised firing during drug induced akinesia. In our experiments, both drugs inhibited movement, albeit somewhat differently, with lack of rigidity and &#65533;flat&#65533; body position after adenosine stimulation. Dopamine blockade decreased mean firing rate and dramatically altered the firing pattern in both investigated structures, generally increasing burst activity (increased percentage of spikes in bursts, mean number of bursts, mean number of spikes per burst, mean intra-burst firing frequency) and decreasing regularity of firing (increased coefficient of variation of the inter-spike intervals). Increased burst activity in the rat basal ganglia in an acute model of parkinsonian akinesia, following systemic raclopride injections, confirmed the importance of changes in the firing pattern in PD. The only electrophysiological effect of systemic A2A stimulation was decreased mean firing rate in the GP, a weak effect that could not propagate towards output stations of the basal ganglia. The lack of changes in the firing pattern, at both input and output levels of the basal ganglia, suggests a correlation with the lack of rigidity in adenosine-stimulation-induced akinesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">basal ganglia</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">electrophysiology</field><field name="subject">adenosine</field><field name="subject">dopamine</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080811.155439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping first semester challenges : first-year students making sense of their teaching and learning environments</field><field name="creator">van der Meer, Jacques</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates first-year students&#65533; challenges in making sense of the learning and teaching environment during their first semester at university. The aims for the research are threefold. Firstly, mapping the range of challenges students at one university faced in their learning and teaching environments in the first semester. Secondly, developing a greater understanding of those challenges. Thirdly, identifying what educational initiatives the university could consider that might assist students to meet those challenges. The challenges were examined in the context of changes in higher education. 
 My interest and motivation for this research project concerns improved practices in the first-year teaching and learning environment, rather than improved students. This means that I did not look for deficits within students, but for indications of what helps or does not help students&#65533; introduction to the new environment of academia. By mapping students&#65533; challenges in the first semester, I hope to contribute to the understanding of academic staff of the range of challenges students have to deal with. 
 The interpretation of the results and my line of argument are partly influenced and shaped by the theoretical framework of academic literacies, and the notion of de-familiarisation. 
 For this project, two data sources were used. The first source was data from a survey carried out in May 2004 amongst students enrolled in 100-level courses. The second source was data from interviews conducted with first-year students in the same year. In considering the analysis as a whole, a number of key issues could be discerned. These related to communication, academic skills, access to resources and help, and engagement and connection. The results showed that some of these issues had less to do with educational practices, and more to do with contested understandings of the nature of university education, and the nature of students now entering university. I argue that underlying these issues there are contentious questions of who should adjust or adapt to whom: students to the university, or the university to students? 
 Students&#65533; reported experiences further suggest that some teachers seemed more aware than others that first-year students face particular challenges. Students did not consider their experiences as reflective of the university as a whole. The university was experienced as an institution with divergent ways of organising courses, of valuing aspects of university learning, and of interpreting seemingly similar things. This suggests that where students experienced challenges, these were not necessarily a function of students&#65533; characteristics, or students&#65533; attitudes to studying, but of particular course environments. 
 The overall picture that presents itself, then, is that there are challenges that could be considered unnecessary. Whereas few students would experience all of the challenges identified in the results chapters, I argue that there are some aspects that warrant improvement. Improvement initiatives in first-year education, however, are not necessarily considered important by all academic staff. This is another contested issue in universities. 
 A more explicit introduction of first-year students to academia as a range of heterogeneous communities would respond to first-year students&#65533; needs for familiarisation and clarity, as well as reflect some of the values that universities could be said to espouse. Successful interventions in first-year education, however, will also depend on ongoing dialogue with staff about various contested issues, the changed and changing context of higher education, and related challenges and opportunities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">college student development programs</field><field name="subject">college student orientation</field><field name="subject">college freshmen</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">services for college students</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081029.154312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode of action of dysgalacticin and mechanism of its producer cell immunity</field><field name="creator">Swe, Pearl M</field><field name="description">Dysgalacticin is a large, 21.5 kDa bacteriocin that belongs to subgroup B of the class III bacteriocins. It is ribosomally produced by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain W2580 and exerts inhibitory activity mainly against the medically important pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes by a "non-lytic" mechanism. Despite numerous studies of the mechanisms of action of a wide variety of bacteriocins and of the basis of their producer strain self-immunity, relatively little is known about the "non-lytic" class of bacteriocins. The structural gene encoding for dysgalacticin (dysA) was known to be carried on a small, rolling circle plasmid pW2580 (3.04 kb) (Heng et al., 2006). However, the dysgalacticin immunity gene (dysI) had not been identified prior to the present study. The aims of this research were to elucidate the mechanism of action of dysgalacticin against S. pyogenes and to identify the genetic basis and the mechanism of producer strain self-immunity. Recombinantly-produced dysgalacticin was used to determine the mode of action against S. pyogenes. Dysgalacticin was bactericidal for S. pyogenes, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane and ultimately leading to leakage of intracellular potassium ions. Moreover, dysgalacticin dissipated the membrane potential and inhibited [&#65533;&#8308;C]serine uptake, a membrane potential-dependent process in S. pyogenes. Interestingly, dysgalacticin inhibited glucose fermentation by non-growing cell suspensions and blocked transport of both glucose and the nonmetabolisable analogue 2-deoxyglucose. This finding indicates that dysgalacticin may target the phosphophenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent glucose and mannose phosphotransferase system (PTS) of S. pyogenes. Taken together, these data suggest that dysgalacticin targets the glucose-PTS and/or mannose-PTS as a receptor, leading to inhibition of sugar uptake, and a subsequent dissipation of the membrane potential leading to cell death. 
 Complementation studies demonstrated that dysI is located on pW2580. RNA analysis showed that dysI is co-transcribed with genes encoding for the plasmid copy control protein, copG and replication initiation protein, repB. S. pyogenes transformed with a plasmid containing dysI displayed a markedly higher dysgalacticin MIC (1024 nM) than the corresponding dysgalacticin-sensitive, plasmid-negative strain (8 nM). Further studies of this DysI-expressing S. pyogenes showed that membrane integrity, glucose fermentation and [&#65533;H]2DG uptake were not affected by dysgalacticin treatment. These findings are consistant with a mechanism whereby the immunity peptide binds to the target-binding site of dysgalacticin, effectively blocking access by the bacteriocin. H&#8326;DysI was found to localise to the cytoplasmic membrane, further indicating that DysI may bind to the proposed target of dysgalacticin, i.e., the membrane-bound glucose-PTS and mannose-PTS. Thus both the mode of action and the producer strain self-immunity of dysgalacticin are likely to be cytoplasmic-membrane based. 
 Homology searching revealed that the bacteriocin SA-M7 produced by M-type 57 S. pyogenes has structural similarities to dysgalacticin, as do two hypothetical proteins, EF1097 and YpkK, of Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, respectively (Heng et al., 2004, 2006). These proteins were all predicted to contain relatively unstructured N-termini and helix-loop-helix structured C-termini. In each case the C-termini contain two conserved cysteine residues that are predicted to form a disulphide bridge. Heterologous expression of SA-M57, EF1097 and YpkK in Escherchia coli demonstrated that all three proteins have antimicrobial activity, but of differeing activity spectra. Reductive-alkylation of SA-M57, EF1097 and YpkK confirmed that their predicted disulphide bonds were essential for biological activity. These proteins were later renamed streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK respectively. The outcome of preliminary domain-swapping experiments supported the existence of functional domain-type segments in streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583, corynicin JK and dysgalacticin. The N-terminal domain of each of these proteins and also the C-terminal domain of corynicin JK were successfully expressed in E. coli. The failure to express the C-termini of the remaining proteins was thought possibly due to toxicity of thses pepetides for the E. coli host. Nevertheless, the C-terminus of corynicin JK displayed an inhibitory spectrum apparently identical to that of the full-length corynicin, indicating that the N-terminus may not always be required for target binding of this class of antimicrobials. Preliminary mode of action studies revealed that streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK all resemble dysgalacticin in that they exert inhibitory activity by non-lytic means. These results, in combination with the protein structural predictions indicate that dysgalacticin, streptococcin A-M57, enterococcin V583 and corynicin JK are all members of the same basic class of "non-lytic" bactericoicns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dysgalacticin</field><field name="subject">Bacteriocins</field><field name="subject">Streptococcus pyogenes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081119.111402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amorphous drug preparation using ball milling</field><field name="creator">Chieng Heng Liang, Norman</field><field name="description">Polymorphism and crystallinity are now recognised as important issues in drug development. This is shown by the increased amount of research in this area over recent years. In pharmaceutical development milling is an important unit operation for size reduction to improve powder handling, processing and dissolution rate. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effect of ball milling (and cryo-milling) on the solid state properties, including amorphous drug formation, of pharmaceutical solids. 
 Milling was carried out using an oscillatory ball mill (Mixer Mill MM301, Retsch GmbH &amp; Co., Germany). In cryo-milling the milling jars were immersed in liquid nitrogen for three min before milling. XRPD was used as the main technique to evaluate the milled samples. Ranitidine hydrochloride (RAN) and indomethacin (INDO) were the model drugs used in this study. 
 It was found that upon milling, RAN form 1 converts to RAN form 2 via an amorphous phase. A faster amorphization rate was observed when the crystalline samples were cryo-milled. Amorphous ranitidine hydrochloride was characterized to have a glass transition (T[g]) range of 13 to 30 &#65533;C and a crystallization exotherm (T[c]) between 30 and 65 &#65533;C. Conversion was found to occur faster when the temperature of the solid powder was greater than the T[c]. Under various storage conditions, similarly, crystallization of the amorphous phase mainly led to RAN form 2. However, some form 1 and amorphous phase was also detected on the XRPD diffractograms. Using partial least squares regression, the amount of solid form components in the ternary RAN mixtures were successfully quantified. RAN form 2 did not convert to form 1 under any milling (including cryo-milling) or storage conditions used in this study. Overall, RAN form 2 was found to be the thermodynamically stable form and the two (RAN) polymorphs are likely to be a monotropic pair. 
 In a co-milling study of INDO and RAN, the two crystalline drugs were successfully converted into a single amorphous phase after 60 min of co-milling in a cold room (4 &#65533;C). The T[g] range (26-44 &#65533;C) was also characterized for these mixtures. DRIFTS spectra of the co-milled amorphous samples indicated an interaction had occurred between the carboxylic acid carbonyl (HO-C=O) and benzonyl amide (NC=O) of the INDO molecule with the aci-nitro (C=NO&#8322;) of RAN. Depending on the ratio of INDO to RAN, in general, the amorphous mixtures were stable at 4 &#65533;C after 30 days of storage. Crystallization was faster when the binary mixtures were stored at higher temperature or contained higher amounts of RAN in the mixture. Although XRPD and DRIFTS suggested an interaction between the two drugs, co-crystal formation was not observed between INDO and RAN. 
 Ball milling can be used to produce amorphous drug. The rate and extent of amorphization is dependent on the milling conditions. A faster rate of amorphization was observed when the crystalline drugs were cryo-milled. Amorphous drug formation can be made either alone or in combination with another crystalline drug. Amorphization could offer a significant improvement on the dissolution profile and the bioavailability of the poorly water soluble drug - indomethacin. Furthermore, ball milling can also be used to produce a homogenous mix between solids. The &#65533;goodmix&#65533; effect can be used for seed-induced crystallization or, when the XRPD or Raman data were combined with partial least squares regression, to create a reliable calibration model for quantitative analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drugs design</field><field name="subject">drug development</field><field name="subject">ball mills</field><field name="subject">amorphous substances</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081209.162001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of intraoral pressure during normal swallowing</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Daniel Lloyd</field><field name="description">Aim: The aim of this research was to measure functional intraoral pressures using a newly developed method; specifically, three areas were examined. Firstly, this new approach to measurement allowed the equilibrium theory of tooth position to be re-addressed. Secondly, it allowed investigation the patterns of pressure change in the palatal midline during water swallowing. Lastly, this approach allowed a preliminary investigation of the affect of the viscosity of the food ingested on the pressures generated in the mouth. 
 Methods: The participants were 6 healthy volunteers (4 males, 2 females) recruited from the post-graduate students at the University of Otago, School of Dentistry. The age range was 25 to 35 years. All had full permanent dentitions, Angle Class I occlusions (normal) with acceptable overbite and overjet relationship, and none of them had a history of previous orthodontic treatment. For each of the subjects a cast chrome-cobalt baseplate was constructed to house 8 miniature strain gauge pressure transducers (Precision Measurement Co. Michigan). The location of the sensors were standardised as follows: Three sensors were paired on the buccal and lingual surfaces of the central, canine and first molar. Two palatal vault sensors were placed in the midline of the palate, one at level of the distal of the first premolar, and the second slightly anterior to the junction of the hard and soft palate. Simultaneous recordings were taken during a set of tasks including water swallows, saliva swallows and food ingestion. 
 Results: The results showed that swallowing was a highly complex wellcoordinated event, and that each individual had their own unique signature pattern of swallowing, characterised by pressure changes of high frequency, in excess of &#65533;1000 kPa/s. 
 Conclusions: The analysis of the pressure acting on the teeth showed that although the pattern and magnitude of pressure generated varied among the group, the observation of waveforms would suggest a tendency for no inherent balance between the buccal and the palatal pressures on the teeth during swallowing for any of the individuals tested. 
 This investigation of the pressure in the midline revealed an aspect previously not fully explored; these experiments showed that there were large and persistent negative pressures generated during swallowing, that preceded the positive pressures and which appear important in bolus propulsion 
 The patterns of swallowing and the magnitudes of pressure generated, changed with the different consistency of the various substances ingested. There was a general trend for increased pressures during swallowing of substrates that are more viscous; water showed the lowest pressures, followed by saliva and finally jelly.

The conception of this metallurgical knowledge has been the major catalyst in the development of increasing socio-political complexity since the beginning of the Bronze Age (Childe, 1930). 
 However, when considering the prehistory of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, it is noted that the introduction of metallurgical activity, namely copper and bronze technology, did not engender the increase in social complexity witnessed in other regions. It is suggested that the region is anomalous in that terms and concepts developed to describe and define Bronze Ages by scholars working in other regions, lack strict analogues within Southeast Asia. Muhly (1988) has famously noted the non-compliance of Southeast Asia to previous models, "In all other corners of the Bronze Age world-China, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Aegean and central Europe-we find the introduction of bronze technology associated with a complex of social, political and economic developments that mark the rise of the state. Only in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and Vietnam, do these developments seem to be missing" (Muhly, 1988:16). 
 This "rise of the state" is associated with the development of hierarchy, inequality, and status differentiation, evidence for which, it is argued, is most explicitly articulated in mortuary contexts (Bacus, 2006). Evidence would include an intra-site restriction in access to resources, including prestige goods, and ranking, a vertical differentiation, often related to interment wealth. Thus the introduction of metallurgical technology saw copper and other prestige goods, used to entrench authority and advertise status (Coles and Harding; 1979). Such evidence has so far been absent in Bronze Age, Southeast Asian contexts. Accordingly, the usefulness of the term "Bronze Age" for describing and defining Southeast Asian assemblages has been questioned (White, 2002). However, the Ban Non Wat discovery of wealthy Bronze Age interments, with bronze grave goods restricted to the wealthiest, has furrowed the brow of many working in the region, providing evidence to at least reconsider this stance. 
 Despite its obvious importance in shaping Bronze Age societies around the globe, and now, significance in Northeast Thailand, very little is known of the acceptance, development, and spread of tin-bronze metallurgical techniques during the prehistory of Southeast Asia. Only a handful of investigations of archaeological sites in the region have investigated the use of metals beyond macroscopic cataloguing. 
 Utilising an agential framework, the Ban Non Wat bronze metallurgical evidence has been investigated as an entire assemblage, from the perspective of the individual metalsmith, in order to greater understand the industry and its impact upon the society incorporating the new technology. 
 Furthermore, mortuary data is investigated by means of wealth assessment, as an insight into social form throughout the corresponding period of adoption, development and spread of metallurgy. 
 The bivalent study of society and technology has shed light on the development of socio-political, and economic complexity during Bronze Age Southeast Asia, and in doing so, outlined the direct impact the metalsmiths themselves had on the supply, spread and functioning of their important industry. 
 Variabilities in grave &#65533;wealth,&#65533; have been identified at Ban Non Wat. A further situation not previously encountered in Bronze Age Southeast Asia, is the restriction of bronze goods, in death, to differentiated, wealthy individuals. The existence of such individuals suggests that society during this period was rather more complex than regional precedents would suggest. I contend that it is the introduction of metallurgy, and in particular, the nature in which it was conducted that engendered these developments. 
 Therefore, when considering the traditional course of developing social-political complexity during the Bronze Age, it now seems that Thailand at least, is potentially, not that anomalous.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bronze age</field><field name="subject">excavations (archaeology)</field><field name="subject">metal-workers</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="subject">Ban Non Wat</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081212.151716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interspecific and intraspecific interactions of trematodes parasitising the New Zealand cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="creator">Leung, Tommy Ling Fong</field><field name="description">Most organisms are rarely infected with just a single species of parasite and are usually simultaneously infected with a range of species. Thus, the parasite fauna of a host represents an entire community composed of multiple individuals from many different species. In nature, it is within the host that parasites can encounter conspecifics and individuals from other species. As in any ecosystem, while such interactions between parasites can be antagonistic due to competition or conflicting interests, association between different species can also be beneficial. 
 In this thesis, I investigated patterns of associations between parasites in the New Zealand cockle Austrovenus stutchburyi through a combination of descriptive and experimental studies employing both standard ecological field techniques and molecular biology methods. 
 It was found that the presence and infection intensity of various parasites species are not independent of each other. Among cockles, an association was found between two trematode taxa, i.e. between the infection intensity by foot-encysting echinostomes and the metacercariae of Gymnophallus sp. It was also found that the presence of the parasitic copepod Pseudomyicola spinosus was associated with greater infection intensity by the echinostomes but not Gymnophallus sp. While it was postulated that the positive association between the echinostomes and Gymnophallus sp. was due to the latter&#65533;s preference to infect cockles that are stranded on the sediment surface as a result of heavy echinostome metacercariae burden in their foot, a field experiment found that Gymnophallus cercariae did not preferentially infect cockles that have been forced to remain above the sediment surface as opposed to those that were forced to remain buried. 
 Meanwhile, the two species of echinostomes known to encyst in the cockle&#65533;s foot, Acanthoparyphium sp. and Curtuteria australis, were found to represent cryptic species complexes. The presence of such cryptic species means that it is possible that some potential interspecific interactions are overlooked. 
 A study of the population structure of Gymnophallus sp. found that each cockle contains multiple genetically distinct individuals and that clonal individuals rarely co-occur in the same cockle. This adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that in addition to acting as a means of reaching the definitive host, the second intermediate host also acts to promote genetic diversity by accumulating cercariae shed by multiple first intermediate hosts in the environment. 
 An experimental infection study conducted with Curtuteria australis cercariae deriving from singly-infected first intermediate hosts revealed that different clonal lineages varied with respect to their contribution to host manipulation. It was found that while certain lineages have a preference for host manipulation, others tend to adopt a "hitch-hiker"-type life history strategy. However, this genetic predisposition was also found to be a phenotypically plastic trait, as the presence of a higher number of manipulators seems to encourage newly-arrived cercariae to become manipulators, regardless of clonal lineage. 
 This thesis provides evidence that patterns of interactions can affect various aspects of parasite life history. Apart from host condition, parasites can also be affected by other parasites. Studying the dynamics of mixed infections can provide informative insights for evolutionary and ecological research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Austrovenus stutchburyi</field><field name="subject">Cardiidae</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">trematoda</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090105.160127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and ranging of Hector&#65533;s dolphins : implications for protected area design</field><field name="creator">Rayment, William J</field><field name="description">The efficacy of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) is contingent on it having a design appropriate for the species it is intended to protect. Hector&#65533;s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), a coastal delphinid endemic to New Zealand, is endangered due to bycatch in gillnets. Analyses of survival rate and population viability suggest that the Banks Peninsula population is most likely still declining despite the presence of the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary (BPMMS), where gillnetting is regulated. More data on distribution and movements of dolphins are therefore required to improve the design of the BPMMS. On aerial surveys of Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution at Banks Peninsula over three years, sightings were made up to 19 n.mi. offshore. On average, 19% of dolphins were sighted outside the BPMMS&#65533;s 4 n.mi. offshore boundary in summer, compared to 56% in winter. On similar surveys of the South Island&#65533;s west coast, all dolphins were sighted within 6 n.mi. of the coast and there was no seasonal change in distribution. At each location, Mantel tests indicated that distance offshore had the strongest and most consistent effect on distribution. However, a logistic regression model using the combined datasets suggested that distribution was most strongly defined by water depth, with all sightings made inside the 90 m isobath. Boat surveys were carried out at Banks Peninsula (2002 to 2006) to continue the long-term photo-ID project. Using the 22 year dataset, alongshore home-range of the 20 most frequently sighted dolphins was estimated by univariate kernel methods. Mean alongshore range was 49.69 km (SE = 5.29), 60% larger than the previous estimate. Fifteen percent of these individuals had ranges extending beyond the northern boundary of the BPMMS. An acoustic data logger, the T-POD, was trialled for passive acoustic monitoring of Hector&#65533;s dolphins. Simultaneous T-POD/theodolite surveys revealed that T-PODs reliably detected dolphins within 200m. No detections were made beyond 500m. To monitor inshore habitat use, T-PODs were deployed in three locations at Banks Peninsula (n = 431 days). A GLM analysis of Detection Positive Minutes (DPM) per day indicated that season had the largest effect on detection rate, with over twice as many DPMs per day in summer (x&#772; = 99.8) as winter (x&#772; = 47.6). The new findings on Hector&#65533;s dolphin distribution and ranging can be used to improve the design of the BPMMS. It is recommended that the offshore boundary of the BPMMS is extended to 20 n.mi. (37 km), the northern boundary is moved 12 km north and recreational gillnetting is prohibited year round. In areas where distribution of Hector&#65533;s dolphin has not been studied, the offshore boundary of MPAs should enclose the 100 m isobath.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hector's dolphin</field><field name="subject">counting</field><field name="subject">Cetacea populations</field><field name="subject">estimates</field><field name="subject">aerial surveys in wildlife management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090227.161621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COncepts and costs for the maintenance of productive capacity: a study of the measurement and reporting of soil quality</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Patricia Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the role accounting plays in the monitoring and reporting of soil quality in one sector of the agricultural industry, broadacre farming.  A survey was conducted with broadacre farmers in the Loddon Catchment, Victoria, Australia.  The primary aim was to determine the effectiveness accounting plays in providing information to decision makers relative to the productive capacity in soil quality and not just on profits.    The capital asset in this study was defined as soil quality. Soils and soil quality in particular, are major elements in determining land value. The concern is decisions are being made by potential buyers and other decision makers, particularly policy makers, with regards to soil quality on the basis of incomplete and often misleading information.  It is proposed that a major reason is due to the fact that different participants in the agricultural and accounting industries require and use different information.    The accounting systems used by farmers are those that have been developed for the manufacturing sector which may not be appropriate for managing long-term, complex resources such as soil.  The farmers themselves did not find formal accounting reports useful for decision making because these reports are based on uniform standards and market prices.    The topic of soil quality and land degradation is viewed from two perspectives.  In one perspective, the proprietary view; the accounting emphasis is on the ownership of assets and the change, both in income and capital, in these assets over time.  In this case the accounting equation is seen as assets - liabilities = equities.  The proprietor takes all the risk.    A more recent perspective in accounting, the entity view, emphasises the assets whether financed from equity or debt and where the accounting equation is seen as assets = equities.  The emphasis changes to the income flow from these assets and more interest is shown in current market prices as a reflection of the future value of these assets    Profit is not necessarily a good indicator of what farmers are doing for their capital asset.

Co-op programs provide learning opportunities for students that enable them to integrate their work and their academic experiences.  Such opportunities, provided that a number of conditions are met, can lead to deep level learning.  Deep level learning results when students engage in and interact with the material that they are learning so that the material is integrated into their knowledge and personal understanding.  Whether or not deep level learning occurs through co-op, depends on various factors including the learning opportunities provided by co-op employers, the students' own commitment and ability to learn, and the commitment of university staff to support this learning.   Insufficient resourcing of co-op programs by universities  and ultimately the government places a major constraint on the programs' potential effectiveness in bringing about the desired learning outcomes for students.  This is particularly the case in Australia where universities are under enormous pressure of reduced government funding and the long-term sustainability of co-op programs is under threat.      In order to justify more funding for co-op programs, it is important to identify and measure the outcomes associated with undertaking co-op.  There has been a great deal written about the outcomes of co-op programs and the associated benefits that accrue to the major co-op stakeholders; students, graduates, universities and employers.   Most of the measurement of these outcomes has, however, taken place in North America.  Furthermore, studies have generally focused on the outcomes for one, or sometimes two, stakeholder groups.   The results of many of these studies have been limited by confounding variables and have been very mixed; with some providing evidence that supports co-op and others providing evidence that does not.  Little work has been done to estimate the costs associated with running co-op programs.      This thesis considered the research question of what is the added value of a cooperative education program.  A positivistic paradigm was adopted and empirical measures of learning and employment outcomes were analyzed for co-op compared to non co-op students and graduates.  The graduates taking part in the study were matched in an effort to overcome some of the methodological limitations of other studies.  The majority of the graduates had completed an Economics, Finance or Commerce degree at one of two major universities located in Melbourne, Australia: one university provides a compulsory co-op program, the other does not.         Through the analysis of the learning outcomes of co-op, this study found that co-op led to a reduction in the proportion of students adopting a surface approach to learning.  The shift from students adopting a surface approach to students adopting a deep approach to learning as a result of co-op, was not evidenced as strongly as expected.  This may have resulted in part, from the lack of funding necessary to provide the level of learning support required to bring about these learning outcomes.   There is, however, evidence to suggest that co-op has a significant impact on the academic performance of students and particularly for those whose academic performance pre co-op was low.       When employment outcomes for co-op graduates and non co-op graduates were analyzed, it was evident that 90% of co-op graduates, compared to only 19% of non co-op graduates, found discipline-related employment within one month of actively seeking a job.  Furthermore, co-op graduates took an average of two weeks to find employment whereas non co-op graduates, with no undergraduate discipline-related work experience, took an average of three-and-a-half months.      There is evidence that employers recognized, through increased salaries, the benefit of the co-op year over and above the experience that can be gained from summer placements, traineeships and post co-op discipline-related work.   While the starting salary for co-op graduates, was significantly higher than for non co-op graduates, this difference disappeared when both cohorts had the same number of years of industry experience.  Even though this result, which is consistent with other studies, appeared not to demonstrate the increased salary advantages associated with co-op, there is another factor that needed to be taken into consideration.  The co-op graduates in this study had a range of academic achievements yet their graduate employment outcomes were at least the same as those for the non co-op graduates who were all high academic achievers.        The impact that co-op has on the achievement of relevant strategic goals and key performance indicators specified by the co-op university was considered and an estimation was also undertaken of the cost of providing this co-op program over and above the government funding received for its support.         It was found that while the co-op program attracted students with the same university entry score as the non co-op program, the non co-op graduates would, with hindsight, have chosen a co-op degree.  This suggests that the pool of quality students applying for entry into the university offering co-op programs could be increased with more effective marketing of co-op to secondary school-leavers.  Academic progression rates and retention rates, two university key performance indicators, were high for co-op students and co-op was a significant factor in achieving the university objective of graduate employability.      While co-op has had a significant impact on the achievement of relevant university goals, it was also found that the university that offers co-op incurs a funding shortfall of approximately $1,300 for every Economics and Finance co-op student.  This amounted to a total funding shortfall of $41,600 for the 32 co-op students included in this study.  One option that is available to the university to find support for the long-term financial sustainability of co-op programs is to seek a share of the significant cost savings experienced by the two other major stakeholders in a co-op program - the government and the employers of co-op graduates.         The estimated savings in graduate recruitment costs as a result of co-op students returning to companies as graduate recruits varied from $1,100 to $3,000 per graduate. This resulted in a total saving of between $19,000 and $51,000 for the 17 Economics and Finance students in this study who returned to their co-op companies as graduate recruits.  The impact of co-op on social welfare payments made by the government was also quite significant.  It was estimated that co-op led to savings of approximately $15,000 in social welfare payments for every co-op graduate - the total social welfare payments made to all the non co-op graduates being $147,000 higher than the total social welfare payments paid to the co-op graduates included in this study.  To achieve these benefits of co-op, the government funds co-op programs at a rate of $1,800 per student.        For the 800 RMIT Business students who currently undertake co-op each year, the funding shortfall experienced by RMIT was extrapolated to be $1.04m.  The associated saving to graduate employers was estimated to be between $500,000 and $1.37m and the expected saving to the government in social welfare payments was estimated to be over $4m while the total funding of co-op programs for the 800 students by the government was $1.44m.  These figures provide a strong case for an increase in the financial support of co-op programs.      In conclusion, while there is a need to extend the research into the added benefits of a cooperative education program to a longitudinal study also covering other discipline areas, there is evidence to show that improved academic and employment outcomes occur for co-op graduates compared to non co-op graduates.  There is also evidence of significant cost savings that accrue to the Australian Federal Government and to graduate employers as a result of co-op.  If these data can be used to transfer resources to the universities that provide these programs then greater efforts can be made to direct the resources in a way that will further enhance the learning and the employment outcomes for co-op graduates.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work integrated learning</field><field name="subject">co-operative education</field><field name="subject">cooperative education</field><field name="subject">stakeholder benefits of co-op</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20050309.163332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lion and the frigate bird: visual encounters in Kiribati</field><field name="creator">Gilkes, Brian Eric</field><field name="description">In order to explain some of the paradoxes and mysteries of the artist's cross cultural experience in Kiribati, he constructed an Artist's Book depicting through visuality, anecdote and reflection, his research process, engaging with current visual perceptions through negotiation with the past.      In Kiribati previous encounters with Europeans and Islanders was dominated by English and I Kiribati with significant contributions by French missionaries.  Each viewed the other through cultural filters of identity, which were informed by concepts of myth-historical, often heroic pasts, modified by contemporary purpose such as power, trade, evangelism or personal gain.  The method of transmission of beliefs about the past differed fundamentally as the Europeans were predominately informed by writing and the I-Kiribati by orality and performance.  The non-literary epistemology of the I Kiribati contributed to a cosmology of non-iconic symbols that defined belief systems and social structures.  These symbols connected place and space with time, self and group identities.  The research found that the all surrounding visual symbol system of sacred meeting house (maneaba), dwelling (bata) and canoe (waa and baurua)) could be partly understood as an ongoing struggle since Deep Time, between the forces of the Ocea n represented by Bakoa, The Shark, and that of the triumph of the coming onto the Land and its people (aba) represented by Tabakea, The Turtle.  The performative outcome of this triumph and the spirit of identity (Te Katai ni Kiribati) it engenders is expressed primarily in the ubiquitous I Kiribati Dance.  The Artists Book is inspired by the creative classic I Kiribati form of oratory known as Te Kuna, using a structure analogous to the symbolic forms of narrative of Oceanic Voyaging traditionally employed by the I Kiribati.      Differences in visual perceptions across cultural interface are understood not only as having the potential for conflict but also as providing positive dynamic force by the interchange of understood differences.      The project contributes specifically to the ethnography of English and I Kiribati, semiotic systems and visual epistemologies, indicating directions towards positive outcomes in cross-cultural encounters.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kiribati</field><field name="subject">Visual Communication</field><field name="subject">Cultural Identity</field><field name="subject">Epistemology</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Myth-history</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Pacific Studies</field><field name="subject">Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural Encounters</field><field name="subject">Ethnology</field><field name="subject">Visual Cognition</field><field name="subject">Visual Narrative</field><field name="subject">Artist's Book</field><field name="subject">Photojournalism</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="subject">Orality</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="subject">Colonialism</field><field name="subject">Historiography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100304.105048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated coastal management to sustainable coastal planning</field><field name="creator">Norman, Barbara</field><field name="description">Integrated coastal management (ICM) has been the basis for coastal planning and management since the 1970s. The theory and practice of ICM is based on the premise that increased integration of planning and management in the coastal zone will lead to improved environmental and social outcomes for the coast. In the context of global and national trends, this thesis examines the application of ICM in three place-based coastal case studies in Victoria: the Gippsland Lakes, Point Nepean and the Geelong region. The particular focus is on the twin challenges of coastal urbanisation and the impacts of climate change. Through a wide range of applied research techniques including focus groups, the research explores the pressures, issues, impacts and implications for ICM and beyond. The case studies point to a number of important implications for ICM and identify opportunities for a more sustainable approach to coastal planning. In reviewing the research findings, a set of  five steps and six principles are proposed to respond to policy failures and provide for a transition to more sustainable coastal planning in Victoria. The five steps involve expanding the theory of ICM to be outcome based and regional in its approach to coastal planning and management. In the context of climate change, a more adaptive and systems approach has been incorporated along with recognising the even greater importance of community engagement in coastal planning processes during a period of increased uncertainty and change. The principal instrument for change is a tripartite intergovernmental agreement on sustainable coastal planning underpinned by a set of six principles. These include: agreed and shared outcomes for the coastal environment to facilitate horizontal and vertical integration; an adaptive and systems approach integrating science and urban planning drawing on experience and knowledge in both disciplines; incorporation of the shared outcomes and an adaptive approach into urban and regio nal planning systems for local implementation; regional governance arrangements for integration of policy outcomes and community involvement; capacity building for sustainable coastal planning including interdisciplinary research and community education and long term monitoring and evaluation. The transition from ICM to sustainable coastal planning does not discard ICM but rather incorporates its strengths and adapts the concept to meet the twin challenges of coastal urbanisation and climate change. Further research questions are posed to indicate how the research findings could be further developed as part of a future coastal research agenda. The research findings seek to make a contribution to the theory and practice of ICM to build a pathway to coastal planning for the benefit of our coast and future generations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrated Coastal Management</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Coastal Planning</field><field name="subject">Gippsland Lakes</field><field name="subject">Point Nepean</field><field name="subject">Geelong region</field><field name="subject">principles</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">intergovernmental</field><field name="subject">urbanisation</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">place-based</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100304.120627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative life cycle assessment of rice husk utilization in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Prasara-A, Jittima</field><field name="description">Thailand is one of the largest rice producing nations in the world. Moreover, there is a trend for Thai rice exports to increase. This could imply that if the trend continues, there will be an increased quantity of rice husk in the future. Rice husk is a co-product of rice products generated in the rice milling process, accounting for about 23 percent of the total paddy weight. To make use of this large quantity of rice husk, the husk has traditionally been used as an energy source in the rice mills themselves. More recently, the Thai government has promoted the use of biomass to substitute for fossil fuel consumption and to reduce the environmental impacts caused by using fossil fuels. Therefore, rice husk, which is one of the main sources of biomass in Thailand, has already been used on a commercial scale. However, the environmental impacts associated with different rice husk applications have not yet been widely investigated in the Thai context. While there is  a need to find ways of dealing with rice husk disposal, it is also important to ensure that this husk is used in ways that harm the environment least.       This research aims to identify the most environmentally friendly use of rice husk for Thailand. To achieve this, the research is divided into three main stages; identification of main current and potential uses of rice husk in Thailand; data collection; and data analysis using Life Cycle Analysis approach. A range of methods such as literature review, questionnaires with rice mill owners, and interviews with industry personnel, were used to help in identifying the current and potential uses of rice husk. The major current and potential rice husk uses chosen to be examined in this research are those uses of rice husk in electricity generation, in cement manufacture and in cellulosic ethanol production. The second stage is to collect detailed data about the processes of the selected rice husk uses to be examined. This was undertaken by literature review, questionnaires and interviews with involved industry personnel. The last stage is to analyse the data collated. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and the L CA software package SimaPro (version 7.1.6) were used to assess the environmental impacts of the selected rice husk uses.      Results from the LCA are reviewed in the context of critical policy issues, including the Thai government biomass policies; the capacity of the production process of rice husk use options; and the infrastructure availability and practicality of the rice husk use options. Based on the goal and scope of the study, the data available for this study and the review of the issues just mentioned, it is concluded that, in the short term, the most practical environmentally friendly use of rice husk across the three uses investigated is the use of rice husk in electricity generation. However, with expected oil shortages in the future, rice husk should also be considered for use in cellulosic ethanol production, as this option helps to save some amount of petrol.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural Waste</field><field name="subject">Bioenergy</field><field name="subject">Energy Policy</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Assessment</field><field name="subject">Rice Husk</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100304.122826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design for ecosystem function: three ecologically based design interventions to support New Zealand&#8217;s indigenous biodiversity</field><field name="creator">Reay, Stephen</field><field name="description">This research project explores opportunities for sustainable design in New Zealand. Recently a new framework for sustainable design was proposed by environmental chemist Michael Braungart and architect William McDonough who suggest that the current paradigm of cradle to grave product development is unable to provide a solution to the world&#8217;s current ecological crisis, and a &#8220;cradle to cradle&#8221; framework is more appropriate. They suggest that their approach, based on examples from nature, ensures that all human activities have a positive ecological footprint, capable of replenishing and regenerating natural systems, as well as guaranteeing that we are able to develop a world that is culturally and ecologically diverse. A group of New Zealand scientists was asked to evaluate the Cradle to Cradle design framework in an attempt to determine the potential of this, or other sustainable approaches, to design New Zealand products. The key findings from these interviews are described and were utilised to propose a new sustainable design framework &#8211; &#8220;design for ecosystem function&#8221;. In design for ecosystem function, biodiversity is placed central to the design decision-making process, alongside human user needs. This framework was then used to help explore the relationship between science and design, while developing three new, innovative and ecologically beneficial products. The three products, or ecological interventions, represent a design response to a range of ecological problems. They include a toy to help children reconnect with nature in urban ecosystems, a trap to assist lizard monitoring and conservation, and a shelter designed to enhance tree survival, and the colonisation of biodiversity in native forest restoration plantings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable product design</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of business networks in the AusIndustry business network program</field><field name="creator">Sweeting, Barbara</field><field name="description">Researchers have found that inter-firm collaboration, that is, co-operative business networks, can provide a competitive advantage that would not be possible independently for small sized firms. Work has been done by some governments, for example, Danish, Norwegian, New Zealand, American and Japanese, in the area of policy and practice of business networks because they have realised the importance of business networking and have encouraged collaboration of small firms by assisting in the facilitation of networks. The Australian government established a Business Network Program which ran for four years and several studies were completed on various aspects of the program during that period. However, there had been no particular research that examined the success or other outcomes of these networks, thus providing the basis for the research question addressed in this research: How and why did the business networks developed in the AusIndustry Business Networks Program, succeed or not succeed? Further, questions relating to how and why these outcomes may have occurred or how they may have been measured in the Australian government facilitated program were also unanswered. A review of the extant literature in this area established the theoretical foundations upon which this research is based and made possible the development of a model comprising three constructs or research issues that would address the research question: RI 1: How and why is network success evaluated? RI 2: How and why do the internal and external environments affect the outcomes of the network? RI 3: How does facilitation affect the network? In order to address these research issues and the research question, a protocol was developed and case study interviews with the lead business of sixteen networks participating in the AusIndustry Business Network Program were carried out. The resultant data was compared for each of the research issues through a qualitative methodology from which conclusions and answers to the research question and issues were derived. The results of this research showed that network members evaluated their own outcomes often using multiple measures, both qualitative and quantitative, with the most common criteria being whether the network continued or discontinued. Moreover, it was concluded in this research that successful networks usually had a single goal or purpose for joining a network which they ultimately achieved. In contrast the unsuccessful networks generally joined the network with multiple goals and which were not all achieved, thus contributing to their lack of success. This result was not evident in the literature reviewed in chapter 2. Additionally, the findings showed that high levels of trust, commitment and reciprocity were essential elements in the success of business networks. More importantly this study found that whilst all successful networks had these elements, some of the non successful ones also reported high levels of trust, commitment and reciprocity. Thus it appeared in this study that whilst these elements are important for network success, they do not alone ensure that success, further, it was noted that for any network that reported a lack of any one of these elements, non success was more likely. In relation to this finding was the discovery that in these networks formal contracts between the network members increased the levels of commitment and reciprocity and thus increased the chances of success. When external environmental factors were examined in relation to their impact on network success, it was found that whilst all had some impact on their business generally, competition was noted as having the highest impact and government or legal issues the lowest impact. Finally, this research found that facilitation did not necessarily contribute to a network&#8217;s success but that possible a lack of appropriate facilitation style did contribute to the non-success of networks. However, it was clear that the small networks needed less facilitator guidance overall and that the larger networks definitely needed facilitation and guidance. Moreover, it was found that the type of facilitation at the various stages of the network process were more important to the likelihood of success, rather than the mere presence of a facilitator. Thus, the main contribution of this theory building research is to extend the general level of knowledge about business networks and provide new insights into network theory and the value of networks using an original application of existing knowledge. This knowledge can contribute to network education and training in business schools and can contribute to the development of future government policy and practice pertaining to network programs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">competition</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00001516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shed project</field><field name="creator">Grinter, Keith</field><field name="description">This project attempts to translate my experience of the everyday street for the viewer; to reveal my experience of walking and looking through drawing.

However, there is an inherent contradiction for the artist engaged with the everyday in that, by definition, the mundane is barely noticed yet it can swiftly become extraordinary when examined closely.

In a decade, this has not been achieved and many cannot make use of resources despite having appropriate facilities. This thesis argues that the necessary management of resources can be achieved with well-designed metadata. Demonstration and explanation of the accessibility problems, efforts to solve them and the current state of inaccessibility of Web resources, any resource that is available through the World Wide Web, is fundamental to the research.    The author relies heavily on Dublin Core metadata as it is relatively easy to use; is probably the most populous metadata; can be managed with free software systems, and for commercial reasons. The research investigated what makes DC metadata, so apparently simple, powerful enough to be the most popular metadata because there is very little available that explains this. The thesis then documents the scientific view of metadata upon which effective use of metadata can be based in the context of accessibility. It argues, at a practical level, that metadata is essential and integral to any shift to an on-going process approach to accessibility. It contributes to the science of metadata in as much as it analyses, synthesizes, and articulates the characteristics of an essential infrastructure for a new approach to accessibility.    The author argues in favour of an on-going process approach to accessibility of resources that supports continuous improvement of any given resource, not necessarily by the author of the resource, and not necessarily by design or with knowledge of the original author, by contributors who may be distributed globally. The thesis argues that the current dependence on production guidelines and post-production evaluation of resources as either universally accessible or otherwise, does not adequately provide for either the accessibility necessary for individuals or the continuous or evolutionary approach possible within the current Web environment. It argues that a distributed, social-networking view of the Web as interactive, combined with a social model of disability, given the management tools of machine-readable, interoperable AccessForAll metadata, as developed, can achieve the desired goals. It raises issues regarding its implementation in the distributed environment of the Web.

By it's dissemination I hope to articulate:    1. How an evolving understanding of my sense disenchantment emerged from the research, and enabled the process of re-engagement.   2. The role, and importance, of provocation and doubt in creative practice generally, but specifically in practice-led research. The difficulty of provoking one's self, and the strategies through which I have tried to enact a disruptive reframing of my practice.   3. That through the highly reflective nature of practice-led research and the greater sense of self-awareness that inevitable comes from that I have been able to re-engage with graphic design. That this re-engagement has, for me specifically, had much to do with my ability to begin to negotiate my own personal terms of reference, so as to be able to locate myself within a community of practice, and to begin to take part in a discourse that has a certain resonance for me.      Central to this research are questions about professional practice, dislocation/disinterest, research, resonance and reinvention.      As disenchantment is common, perhaps pervasive, within professional practice, my account of this research will propose that a more general understanding of practice-led research-highly reflective, self-initiated work-is essential if graphic design is to support and sustain imaginative, innovative, and inventive practitioners. Rather than target graphic design's inability to support provocative practices (the studio, or the industry), my research focuses on the potential of the individual practitioner to motivate and design a more generative and engaged practice.

It is based on the life stories of ten Cambodian refugees who presently live in Melbourne Australia.  The stories that people told me were about their experiences of life before the Pol Pot regime, their survival of one of the twentieth century's totalitarian regimes, then their travel to and life in the Thai refugee camps and more recently their experiences of resettlement and life in Australia.  My work explores the profound impact these life experiences had on Cambodian people and how they remembered and told stories about their past.  Further, it considers how these experiences shaped the identities of survivors of the Pol Pot years.  It is clear that the Cambodian refugee experience tells us that people can do the most terrible things to other people, but it is also clear that human beings can also survive almost any situation.  In this regard my work shows that life is a most precious and fragile thing,  but it also has an amazing strength and resilience.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">refugees</field><field name="subject">Pol Pot regime</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">experience</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">narrative.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100311.142541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A social history of Australian workplace football, 1860-1939</field><field name="creator">Burke, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis is a social history of workplace Australian football between the years 1860 and 1939, charting in detail the evolution of this form of the game as a popular phenomenon, as well as the beginning of its eventual demise with changes in the nature and composition of the workforce. Though it is presented in a largely chronological format, the thesis utilises an approach to history best epitomised in the work of the progenitors of social history, E.P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm, and their successors. It embraces and contributes to both labour and sport history-two sub-groups of social history that are not often considered together. A number of themes, such as social control and the links between class and culture, are employed to throw light on this form of football; in turn, the analysis of the game presented here illuminates patterns of development in the culture of working people in Victoria and beyond. The thesis also provides new insights into under-re searched fields such as industrial recreation and the role of sport in shaping employer-employee relations. In enhancing knowledge of the history of grass roots Australian football and demonstrating the workplace game's links with the growth of unionism and expansion of industry, the thesis therefore highlights the complexity and interconnectedness of economic development, class relations and popular culture in constructing social history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian football</field><field name="subject">working class culture</field><field name="subject">industrial relations</field><field name="subject">Australian social history</field><field name="subject">social control</field><field name="subject">industrial recreation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100311.144947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of bank lending in sustaining income/ wealth inequality in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Saliya, Candauda Arachchige</field><field name="description">The purpose of this PhD thesis is to make a contribution to existing knowledge in the field of critical accounting by studying credit mechanisms and their link to income/wealth inequality in Sri Lankan society and the role of accounting technology in facilitating such mechanisms. The literature review revealed that: a) Global inequality is aggravated by the disparity of economic development which is possible only through state intervention; b) Unemployment is considered as a dilemma for economic development in developing countries by most politicians/administrators/researchers; c) In any country, around 60-70 percent of employment is generated by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and; d) Their major problem is access to credit. This research was designed to find out how the credit system works and why certain SMEs do not have adequate access to credit to develop their businesses; to provide employment; to increase the share of national income to the lower income groups; to narrow down the gap between the rich and poor within and between countries. A case study research approach was followed to extract data on real-life experiences of the research participants. Reliability of data was ensured by using various verification techniques and maximum efforts were made to balance the two extremes of validity of the research; internal and external. The extent of representation by the cases and the bank was tested, and judged as high, with 12-14 characteristics common to the Sri Lankan credit culture and banking industry respectively. Marxian critical theories were used for theoretical guidance throughout the research. The three case studies provide empirical evidence for the existence of the discriminatory nature of credit decision-making where two credit applicants were successful but a third credit applicant failed in obtaining credit. It is contended that the two successful applicants were powerful enough to approach a more powerful bank Chairperson and to obtain credit outside the normal credit rules with the support of accounting technology and using masks such as patriotism and social responsibility. The other applicant, who was initially accommodated with credit at the lower level, could not convince the credit decision-makers at the higher level with expensive professionally prepared accounting reports. This applicant was not from an influential social network and could not reach the powerful credit decision-makers informally was rejected through strict application of credit rules. Deep analysis of these facts supports the Marxian claim that credit and exploitation mechanisms work towards concentration of wealth and sustaining income inequality. Credit decisions supply money to influential individuals and it is argued that such economic power enhances the social powerbase of those individuals, which in turn reinforces the propensity to make preferential credit decisions, thereby making them richer. In contrast, a lack of money translates into powerlessness, deprivation and exclusion from social activities for the majority of the poor. In this process opportunities are lost to disadvantaged social groups and this necessarily results in poor people&#8217;s economic status remaining stagnant. These power-driven, discriminatory decision-making systems not only restrict the availability of financial capital for feasible projects, but also deny credit to potential enterprises. Further, wasting resources on unfeasible projects, while ignoring the need for nurturing potentially viable projects, are a double blow to efforts towards employment generation and economic development and therefore, are detrimental to the economic well-being of the general population. These findings provide insight for policy formulators for more productive financial capital mobility systems in Sri Lanka. It is suggested that suitable State intervention in regulating SME financing could remove such credit-related obstacles to economic development, and work towards a fair distribution of economic benefits to the people in Sri Lanka and beyond.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit mechanism</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Income Inequality</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">Case-studies</field><field name="subject">Credit decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interplay - a visual exploration of the processes of individuation</field><field name="creator">Gorst, Beth Jo-Ann</field><field name="description">This project is an exploration, through art making processes, of a relationship between the interpretation of symbols and the interpretation of everyday life experiences, with a view to evolving a metaphorical visual language that might translate these experiences. Individuation is a process within Jungian psychology that relates the interpretation of symbols to the interpretation of life experiences and places their common meanings within a definitive framework of individual human development. The archetypal pattern that this framework outlines is the development of a healthy relationship between an individual&#8217;s consciousness and the unconscious. The word metaphor originates from Greek metapherein &#8211; &#8220;to carry over, transfer; meta` beyond, over + fe`rein to bring, bear. It is the transference of the relation between one set of objects to another set for the purpose of brief explanation&#8230; the statement &#8220;that man is a fox,&#8221; is a metaphor&#8221; (Webster&#8217;s Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 2008) Due to its particular relationship to time, space, memory and light photography has proven to be an ideal way to engage, record, and present this exploration. Our personal photographs operate as visual metaphors for our personal experience, we transfer the experience into the photograph, we consider the photograph is that moment in time, that place, that experience, rather than being like that experience. The interpretation of personal photographs is entirely individual and emotional. When photographs are placed into the public arena their emotional value changes, their interpretation, purpose, and authenticity can become questionable. In this project the experience and the photographs are placed within the context of individuation, which is a model that guides the interpretation of the photographs and include the individual and emotional values as a necessary part of that interpretation. In this project the symbols and visual metaphors interpreted in the photographs operate as a narrative of the personal experience of the archetypal journey of individuation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human science research</field><field name="subject">Post traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Jungian theory of individuation</field><field name="subject">Intuative image making</field><field name="subject">Archetypes and the unconscious</field><field name="subject">Translating experience via art making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel applications of Association Rule Mining- Data Stream Mining</field><field name="creator">Vithal Kadam, Omkar</field><field name="description">From the advent of association rule mining, it has become one of the most researched areas of data exploration schemes.

In dominance hierarchies individuals with the greatest competitive ability will occupy prime locations during optimal periods to increase efficiency in gathering a resource. Subdominant individuals with low competitive abilities may be forced to reside in habitats of poor quality relative to dominant individuals. In this study I examined the long term patterns of giant kokopu distribution, movement, growth, habitat use, and social interaction between fish in relation to invertebrate drift (food supply). 
 The habitat quality and abundance of food along a one km section of Alex&#65533;s Creek was monitored for a two year period. Though the physical structure of Alex&#65533;s Creek was relatively homogenous there were significant spatial differences in the density of drifting invertebrates sampled between riffles and pools over this long temporal period. In general, more drifting invertebrates were sampled in riffles of relatively long length and area. 
 Within Alex&#65533;s Creek the distribution of giant kokopu, Galaxias argenteus, was determined by patchy distributions of food supply, specific physical factors of pools, and interactions between fish in dominance hierarchies. Over the 20 month study period, the most important biotic factor determining fish biomass was the total number of drifting invertebrates within pools while the most important abiotic factor determining fish abundances within pools was the pool size (surface area). The growth rate of individual fish correspondingly varied between fish residing within pools of different quality. Growth rates were higher for individual fish residing in pools with a relatively high density of drifting invertebrates. 
 The differences in individual growth rates of giant kokopu may determine when fish leave a particular habitat patch (pool) and move to a new one. Fish that moved had lower growth rates (before moving) than fish that remained resident within home pools. Overall the movement of giant kokopu within Alex&#65533;s Creek was very restricted due to a relatively consistent distribution of food, however there were differences in the mobility of giant kokopu among different social ranks. The most dominant fish in pools were largely sedentary while fish ranked directly below fish 1 (i.e. fish 2 and 3 in social hierarchies) were relatively mobile. 
 The ability of dominant fish to exclude subdominant fish from the most preferred feeding positions during optimal feeding times had consequences for overall giant kokopu activity. Under normal food supply conditions dominant fish were predominantly nocturnal and maintained large home ranges at night. Conversely subdominant fish occupied large home ranges by day, but were generally not observed at night. When the food supply was limited the utilization of pools was determined by social rank. Dominant fish from each pool increased daytime activity, home range size, aggressiveness, and the capture of food items offered by day while simultaneously reducing the spatial and temporal activity and habitat use of subdominant fish. These results indicate that behavioral changes in large dominant fish influence and reduce the amount of resources available to subdominant fish.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giant kokopu</field><field name="subject">geographical distribution</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20060728.142904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addressing complexity in product design : guidelines for product designers</field><field name="creator">Gollner, Mark</field><field name="description">Modern product design projects are often challenged by their interdisciplinary nature, increasing product complexity and time pressure. The challenge for product designers is to recall all relevant design aspects that are potentially applicable and important for the product to be designed at the right time. The negligence of certain design aspects may result in increased development costs and in inferior products. A recommended way to handle complexity in the design process is to work systematically, with checklists and guidelines offering a possibility to support product designers in this task. However, design guidelines that provide a comprehensive and generically content that support product designers holistically in their design projects are not readily available. Moreover, in-depth evaluations of the role, use, usefulness and usability of design guidelines are quite rare in the current literature. 
 Therefore, the research study presented in this thesis sought to accomplish two tasks: the generation of a comprehensive set of generic and practically aimed product design guidelines in a paper-copy format that holistically supports product designers in their often complex design projects; and the evaluation of these generated design guidelines with the purpose of determining their role, use, usefulness and usability for product designers. 
 A comprehensive and generically applicable set of product design guidelines in a ready-to-use paper-copy format that holistically provides in-depth information for the product design aspects that need to be considered during a design process was generated. Besides, a research study, using questionnaires and interviews, with product design students and professional product designers in New Zealand was carried out with the purpose of determining the role, use, usefulness and usability of the generated design guidelines for designers. As a consequence, valuable insights into the role of the guidelines as practitioners&#65533; design tool for professional designers and noteworthy findings about the role of the guidelines as educational tool for novice designers were obtained. 
 The findings suggested that the use of guidelines as a tool in the design process is generally not very prevalent due to the designers&#65533; lack of knowledge about the benefits, location and accessibility of useful product design guidelines. Furthermore, it has been found that the designers used the generated guidelines sporadically and driven by their interest or demand in the design aspects applicable to their projects. In terms of the guidelines&#65533; usefulness it has been identified that the guidelines evaluated were generically applicable to different projects and provided a specific in-depth content. The guidelines have also been found to be quite useful as educational, planning, management and evaluation tool for novice and professional designers. 
 However, in terms of the guidelines&#65533; usability, several problems were determined that made the generated guidelines too inefficient to be beneficial for the participants, especially for the professional designers. Accordingly, it has been concluded that a change of the guidelines&#65533; format into a digital interactive format, is likely to solve most of the identified problems and provide a useful and usable tool for product designers respectively.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design methodology</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">product management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.154020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isotropic medium chain mono- and diglyceride systems : vehicles for subcutaneous injection in sheep</field><field name="creator">Sari, Peyami</field><field name="description">Purpose: To develop an approach to formulating an injectable solution containing both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs for subcutaneous administration. Based on the literature survey, isotropic medium chain mono-and diglyceride (MCMDG) systems were chosen for study. For this purpose, analytical methods were developed and validated. In vitro assessments of the MCMDG systems, and in vitro release and in vivo studies were conducted. 
 Methods: The phase diagrams of the isotropic MCMDG systems were constructed with systems comprising two and three components. The isotropic region was examined by visual inspection and confirmed using polarized light microscopy. Viscosities of formulations were measured. The validated HPLC assay methods were developed for determination of levamisole and abamectin in liquid formulations and in sheep plasma. The HPLC assay was capable of evaluating stability of abamectin and levamisole in liquid formulations. Solubilities of levamisole hydrochloride or levamisole phosphate and abamectin were determined in the isotropic MCMDG formulations using a HPLC assay method. Stabilities of levamisole phosphate and abamectin were conducted in the isotropic MCMDG formulations at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. In vitro release studies for levamisole phosphate were carried out for selected formulations using modified Franz diffusion cells. Based on stability and in vitro release studies, one formulation (MCMDG/propylene glycol (PG):glycerol formal (GF), 20/20:60 % w/w) was selected for a preliminary in vivo study. The selected MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation containing both levamisole phosphate and abamectin was injected subcutaneously into sheep, and the injection site was examined after subcutaneous injection. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. A correlation between in vitro fraction released (FR) and in vivo fraction absorbed (FA) for levamisole phosphate from the MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation was assessed. 
 Results: The isotropic systems of the MCMDG systems containing two or three components were characterized through phase diagrams and viscosity. The solubility of the levamisole hydrochloride in the isotropic MCMDG/sesame oil/water formulations was higher in the absence of abamectin than in combination with abamectin. Solubility of levamisole phosphate was higher in the MCMDG system containing GF or PG compared to the MCMDG/SO/water system. The isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF systems allowed preparations of levamisole phosphate/abamectin solution dose forms containing more than the usual dosage of levamisole. Stability of both levamisole phosphate and abamectin in MCMDG/PG:GF formulations was higher compared with MCMDG/PG:GF/water formulations. Levamisole phosphate degraded in the presence or absence of abamectin in the MCMDG/PG:GF (20/20:60) formulation at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. Abamectin alone was found to be stable in the formulation at 60&#65533;C for 10 days. In vitro release of levamisole phosphate from water and the MCMDG formulations tested displayed first-order kinetics. Water from the receptor compartment was observed to pass through the membrane into the donor compartment. Therefore, an advancing layer of turbidity occurred in the donor phase. A highly significant decrease in release rate of levamisole phosphate was obtained in MCMDG/GP:GF (20/20:60) formulation compared to water and the other formulations. Pharmacokinetic studies of subcutaneous injection of MCMDG/PG:GF 20/20:60) formulation showed the tmax values of 2.2 h and 4.2 days for levamisole phosphate and abamectin, respectively. The Cmax was 0.94 [mu]g/ml for levamisole phosphate and 6.24 ng/ml for abamectin while the formulation displayed the AUC value was 5.2 [mu]g&#65533;h&#65533;ml&#8315;1 for levamisole phosphate and 84.7 ng&#65533;day&#65533;ml&#8315;1 for abamectin. No inflammatory reaction was observed at the injection site. Linear regression analysis showed that a significant relationship between the FR (in vitro) and FA for the subcutaneously injected formulation. 
 Conclusion: The study carried out in this thesis introduces a new approach to formulating an injectable solution of the isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF systems containing both levamisole (hydrophilic drug) and abamectin (lipophilic drug) for subcutaneous administration, and presents the development of the HPLC assay methods for determination of levamisole and abamectin in liquid MCMDG formulations and plasma, in order to investigate in vitro and in vivo release from the isotropic MCMDG/PG:GF formulations. The MCMDG/PG:GF formulations may represent an alternative to the more traditional formulations for both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">injections</field><field name="subject">solutions (pharmacy)</field><field name="subject">drugs administration</field><field name="subject">sheep as laboratory animals</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070405.160443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of calcium-dependent pathways in vestibular compensation</field><field name="creator">Sansom, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">Damage to one vestibular apparatus (unilateral vestibular deafferentation, UVD) results in severe postural and ocular motor disturbances (such as spontaneous nystagmus, SN) that recover over time in a process known as vestibular compensation. However, the underlying neurochemical mechanisms of vestibular compensation are poorly understood. While UVD affects many areas in the CNS, attention has focused upon the partially deafferented second order neurons in the vestibular nuclei complex (VNC). Several converging lines of evidence suggest that Ca&#65533;&#8314;-permeable ion channels (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca&#65533;&#8314;-channels) and intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314;-dependent protein kinases play an important role in vestibular compensation. However, the nature of this involvement and the locus of these changes are unknown. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of Ca&#65533;&#8314; signalling pathways in the VNC during vestibular compensation in guinea pig. These issues were investigated in three separate experiments that utilised two methodological approaches: i) in vitro assays were used to determine the nature and extent of protein phosphorylation within the VNC at various stages of compensation; and ii) ion channel blockers or cell-permeable kinase inhibitors were injected directly into the VNC immediately before UVD to determine whether or not these systems were causally involved in compensation. 
 The results of experiment 1 (Chapter 5) showed that a bolus intra-VNC injection of an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but not an L-type voltage-gated Ca&#65533;&#8314; channel antagonist, temporarily reduced SN frequency at the earliest measurement time (6 hours post-UVD). These results suggested that the initial expression of SN required, in part, the activation of NMDA receptors in the VNC on the side of the UVD, and by inference, Ca&#65533;&#8314; entry through the ion channel. The results of experiment 2 (Chapter 6) revealed that the medial VNC contains abundant Ca&#65533;&#8314;/calmodulin-dependent and Ca&#65533;&#8314;/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase activities. The same VNC tissue removed from animals at various times after UVD, showed that vestibular compensation is accompanied by specific changes in the phosphorylation of several major protein kinase C substrates. These included an unidentified 46-kDa band, and a 75-kDa band with similar characteristics to the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). These results suggest that protein kinase C signalling pathways may be involved in vestibular compensation. The results of experiment 3 (Chapter 7) are consistent with these results showing that intra-VNC infusion of a protein kinase C inhibitor, but not a Ca&#65533;&#8314;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor, significantly increased SN at the earliest measurement times (6 and 8 hours), but had no effect upon the time taken to achieve compensation or on postural compensation. These results suggest that the induction of SN compensation involves protein kinase C activity in the VNC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the expression of SN (e.g., Ca&#65533;&#8314; influx via NMDA receptors) are possibly distinct from those that initiate its compensation (e.g., PKC activation). The downstream effects of raised intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314; may involve protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of key intracellular proteins that initiate long-lasting changes in cellular function within the VNC.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methyl aspartate</field><field name="subject">vestibular apparatus</field><field name="subject">labyrinth (ear)</field><field name="subject">calcium channels</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070418.145158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Textile fibre from six cultivars of harakeke (Phormium tenax)</field><field name="creator">Cruthers, Natasha Marie</field><field name="description">The object of this study was to identify microscopic differences among six selected cultivars of harakeke traditionally used by Maori in weaving. The cultivars were Arawa, Makaweroa, Paretaniwha, Takaiapu, Takirikau, and Tapamangu.
The effectiveness of different microscopy techniques for taking measurements of the dimensions of ultimate fibres using a factorial experimental design was investigated in part A. Constant variables were geographical location, location of specimens along the leaf, season (winter), individual plant, fan, north-facing fan, and age of plant (approximately seven years), and cultivars (Paretaniwha and Tapamangu). Experimental variables were the microscopy techniques used and measurement axis.
Techniques selected use on further cultivars in part B were transverse sections of leaf specimens 4 m thick, embedded in Paraplast&#65533; and observed using LM, and non-fixed ultimate fibres observed using SEM.
In part B the dimensions of ultimate fibres from the six selected cultivars of harakeke were measured, and analysed (ANOVA and Tukey's HSD), and the transverse section shapes of fibre aggregates were observed. Transverse widths of ultimate fibres ranged from 10.15 m (Takaipu) -12.80 m (Paretaniwha). Ultimate fibre lengths ranged from 3735 m (Takirikau) - 4751 m (Makaweroa). The cultivars prizes for muka, Arawa and Makaweroa, had the longest and finest ultimate fibre bundles more uniform in transverse-sectional shape than the other cultivars studied and perhaps this explains their selection for extraction of muka. Takirikau had a high yield of ultimate fibre bundles, and perhaps this makes extraction of muka worthwhile. Paretaniwha differed from the other five cultivars studied having an average number of ultimate fibre bundles per unit width that were narrow and non-uniform in shape, and composed of short, thick, ultimate fibre cells.
The microscopic structure of muka from six selected cultivars of harakeke used traditionally for weaving varied and may explain differences perceived by weavers, and that different end uses are preferred for various cultivars.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">harakeke</field><field name="subject">phormium tenax</field><field name="subject">flax</field><field name="subject">textile chemistry</field><field name="subject">textile fabrics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070501.135549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making culture or making culture possible : notions of biculturalism in New Zealand 1980s cinema and the role of the New Zealand Film Commission</field><field name="creator">Kontour, Kyle</field><field name="description">In the 1970s and 1980s New Zealand experienced significant socio-economic upheaval due in part to the global economy, economic experiments, and the gains of Maori activism. Despite the divisiveness of this period (or possibly because of it), anxieties over notions of New Zealand national identity were heightened. There was a general feeling among many Kiwis that New Zealand culture (however it was defined) was in danger of extinction, mostly due to the dominant influences of the United states and Britain. New Zealanders sought ways to distinguish themselves and their nation. One of the ways in which this desire was manifested was in the establishment of the New Zealand Film Commission (NZFC). This government sponsored body corporate was designed to provide an infrastructure for New Zealand filmmaking, through which New Zealand and New Zealanders could be represented. As a result, New Zealand filmmaking boomed during the early to mid-1980s. Significantly, this boom occurred simultaneous to the increasing relevance and importance of notions of biculturalism, both in cultural and socio-political terms.
	The question that drives this thesis is how (or whether) biculturalism was articulated in the explicit or implicit relationships between cultural debates, governmental policies, the NZFC&#65533;s own policies and practices and its interaction with filmmakers. This thesis examines the ways in which aspects of the discourse of biculturalism feature in New Zealand cinema of the 1980s in terms of the content, development, production and marketing of three films of this era that share particular bicultural themes and elements: Utu (Geoff Murphy, 1983), The Quiet Earth (Geoff Murphy, 1985) and Arriving Tuesday (Richard Riddiford, 1986). This thesis also examines the role of the NZFC in these processes as prescribed by legislation and in terms of the NZFC&#65533;s own policies and procedures.
	This thesis consults a variety of primary and secondary sources in its research. Primary sources include film texts, public documents, archival material, trade journals, and interviews with important figures in the New Zealand film industry.
	Conclusions suggest that the interaction of numerous socio-historical factors, and the practices and policies of the NZFC, denote a process that was not direct in its articulation of notions of biculturalism. Rather, this involved an array of complex cultural, fiscal. industrial, professional and aesthetic forces.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion picture industry</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070508.140943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immune profiles in sheep following experimental infection with Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Begg, Douglas</field><field name="description">Johne&#65533;s disease in ruminants is caused by the pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. An experimental infection model in sheep was developed as a prelude to the testing of new vaccines and the development of improved diagnostic assays for Johne&#65533;s disease. The final challenge model developed used four doses of 10&#8313; viable organisms given at two to three day intervals. Gross and microscopic lesions were found in a high proportion of sheep (80%) at ten months post challenge. There was considerable variation in immune responses from animals challenged with different strains of M. paratuberculosis. Sheep challenged with a low passage laboratory culture of strain (W) M. paratuberculosis, produced strong lymphocyte transformation responses and Interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;) production at two months post challenge. Subsequent necropsy and culture from intestinal tissues showed only a low level of infection (25%). In comparison a primary tissue isolate of M. paratuberculosis (JD3) resulted in higher (60-90%) infection rates in orally challenged animals. The immune profile from these animals showed very little reactivity for the first three months post challenge, after which IFN-&#947; production could be detected. Antibody production and lymphocyte transformation response could not be measured until at least seven months post challenge. Sheep challenged with the primary tissue isolate instilled directly into the tonsil resulted in equivalent levels of Johne&#65533;s disease to those obtained with oral challenge. However, intratonsillar challenge resulted in higher levels of immune reactivity than oral challenge. 
 The proprietary Johne&#65533;s vaccines; NeoparsecTM and GudairTM and an Aqueous vaccine were tested in sheep. The immunological reactions of the sheep to these vaccines showed some variations between the two separate studies, with the NeoparasecTM and GudairTM vaccines evoking high levels of CMI and humoral reactivity within two months of vaccination. Detailed immunological examination of gut associated lymphoid tissues were carried out on subgroups of animals that were either vaccinated or non-vaccinated and went on to develop disease or were immune to experimental challenge. The results showed that the diseased animals examined had multibacillary lesions and strong CMI and humoral responses. There were decreased proportions of CD4&#8314;, CD8&#8314; and CD25&#8314; T cells in peripheral blood and gut associated lymphatics of diseased animals compared with the immune or unchallenged subgroups. Profiles from the immune subgroups showed a stronger lymphocyte transformation response than case matched diseased animals. Tissues from immune animals showed increased proportions of B cells above those seen in diseased or unchallenged animals. This study has resulted in the development of a robust experimental sheep model in which Johne&#65533;s disease occurs in a high proportion of challenged animals. Critical time points for the establishment of infection or disease have been determined. It can be used in the future to evaluate protective efficacy of vaccines or to critically chart immunological profiles that are associated with infection, disease or protective immunity. Considerable research is needed to develop improved diagnostic tests to identify patterns of immunity during the early stages of infection or while the animal has subclinical disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">tuberculosis in animals</field><field name="subject">immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium paratuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070427.142318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"An indolent and chilly folk" : the development of the idea of the "Moriori myth"</field><field name="creator">Clayworth, Peter</field><field name="description">Throughout the nineteenth century probably the majority of Pakeha held the view that the East Polynesian ancestors of the Maori were the first people to settle in New Zealand. Over the same period there were always considerable numbers of Pakeha who held the alternative view that an earlier people were already living in New Zealand when the first East Polynesian immigrants arrived. Among Maori each hapu and iwi had their own origin traditions. Some held that their ancestors arrived to an empty land, while others believed there were other groups already here when their own ancestors arrived. The traditions of the Chatham Island Moriori indicated that they were also East Polynesian migrants, but some Pakeha speculated that the Moriori were a distinct people from the Maori.
	By the early twentieth century one set of ideas on early settlement had become the orthodox view of the past among Pakeha. This view, which held sway from the 1910s until at least the 1960s, maintained that the original people of New Zealand were the &#65533;Moriori&#65533;, a people only distantly related, if at all, to the Maori. This primitive early people were supposed to have been displaced by the arrival of the more advanced East Polynesian Maori. Some of the more fortunate Moriori were absorbed into the Maori tribes, while the majority were either killed or driven into exile on the Chatham Islands. This idea of the past, sometimes called the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533;, has now been largely rejected by scholars, but still holds some currency in popular circles.
	The current thesis examines the question of how the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; developed and eventually became the orthodox view of the past. This question is investigated in the contexts of British imperial expansion, of the development of scientific ideas on race and evolution, and of the study of language and folklore as a way to decipher racial history. The current thesis is largely based on the writings of Pakeha and Maori scholars of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Letters and manuscripts, in both English and Maori, have been used, along with published books and papers. The major focus of the work is the idea that the Moriori Myth largely developed out of the Pakeha study of Maori oral history. This study of oral history led to a considerable degree of interaction between Pakeha scholars and Maori experts.
	A major focus in the early part of the work is on Pakeha attempts to determine the racial identity and history of the Chatham Island Moriori. In this part of the work considerable attention has been paid to the collaborative work of the Pakeha scholar Alexander Shand and the Moriori expert Hirawanu Tapu, who worked together to record the surviving Moriori traditions.
	The focus of the latter part of this thesis is on the creation by Pakeha scholars of theoretical models of the early migrations to New Zealand, based on their understandings of Maori oral traditions. It will be argued that the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; was largely based on the writings of Stephenson Percy Smith, as promoted by himself and Elsdon Best, through the medium of the knowledge network formed by the Polynesian Society. Smith&#65533;s writings on the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; will be shown to have been largely based on his interpretations of the writings of the Ngati Kahungunu scholar Hoani Turei Whatahoro. It will be argued that the &#65533;Moriori Myth&#65533; was in fact the creation of interactions between Pakeha scholars and Maori experts rather than the invention of any one person or group.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moriori</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">ethnology</field><field name="subject">origin</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070518.112910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stone tool production at Cat's Eye Point, Kakanui, North Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Amanda J</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a lithic assemblage from Cat&#65533;s Eye Point (J42/4), Kakanui, North Otago, New Zealand. This archaic site was excavated during 1996 and 1997 and the lithic assemblage was collected from 41m&#65533; excavated during these two seasons. Previous studies of lithic material from New Zealand and the Pacific are reviewed to indicate the range of information that can be gained from lithic analysis. Themes of research in the North Otago region are also examined to place Cat&#65533;s Eye Point into its regional context.
	This thesis had three main areas of investigation. The first involved a descriptive and technological analysis of the debitage using mass flake analysis (MFA) and individual flake analysis (IFA). Formal artefacts, such as hammerstones, blanks, and performs, were also examined. Secondly, spatial analysis was used to determine if the lithic assemblage could be used to infer intra-site activity areas. This was conducted by analysing macro- (flakes larger than 3mm) and microdebitage (flakes less than 3mm) by examining the range of material types. The third area of investigation examined debitage recovered from 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and 3.2mm (1/8 inch) sieves to determine if any significant technological information was gained by debitage from the 3.2mm sieve.
	The conclusions of this study indicate that there were two methods of basalt cobble reduction at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point for adze production. Adze production at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point was opportunistic and the non-local material curated. The results of the debitage analysis indicate that the entire sequence of adze manufacture did not occur in the excavated area of Cat&#65533;s Eye Point and the initial cobble reduction probably occurred on the adjacent beach where the cobbles are found today. Consequently, coastal rock outcrops, even without evidence of associated debitage, must be viewed as potential sources of rock for stone tool manufacture unless determined otherwise. The spatial analysis detected two activity areas and a disposal area at Cat&#65533;s Eye Point. The analysis of the 6.4mm and 3.2mm debitage found that no significant technological information was gained by examining the smaller flakes.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Kai Tahu</field><field name="subject">stone implements</field><field name="subject">tools</field><field name="subject">antiquities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070523.143909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The University, Maori Studies and Treaty praxis</field><field name="creator">Pohatu, Godfrey H</field><field name="description">This study is an attempt to interrogate the shared terrain of academic Maori Studies, Treaty of Waitangi praxis (where &#65533;praxis&#65533; is defined as the practical use of reason and the resonable use of practice - in contrast to purely theoretical activity) and the University system in this country. In this wide ranging &#65533;interrogation&#65533;, I will employ a dialectical method of analysis where each of the major Articles of the Treaty are assigned a particular &#65533;role&#65533; in the Thesis because it represents the central &#65533;University&#65533; or Kawanatanga Problematic; that Article 2 (Tino Rangatiratanga-Chieftainship) is the Antithesis because it represents the &#65533;Maori&#65533; contradiction or the Tino Rangatiratanga Mandate; and that Article 3 (Kotahitanga-Unity and Association) is the Synthesis because it represents Treaty Praxis&#65533; or the Kotahitanga Solution.
	This study (like the Treaty) has been organised into five appropriate Parts:
	Part A (The Preamble) provides the overture for the study, and, as such, contextualises the methodological framework and theoretical paradigms in, on and around which the rest of the study is located.
	Part B (The Kawanatanga Problematic) will attempt to articulate the struggle of Maori Studies in academia by problematising Kawanatanga (as is the case in most of the scholarship on this critical aspect of the Treaty).

	Part D (The Kotahitanga Solution) will attempt to synthesise Treaty praxis within the debate by outlining and evaluating a number of Treaty principles and examples.
	Part E (Post-Script) will summarise the personified (signatory) aspects of the study and will also attempt to articulate a possible future for Maori Studies.
	It is hoped that the analytical framework employed in this study and will also attempt to articulate a possible future for Maori Studies.

	This thesis proposes a model for research into traditional Maori kaupapa.
	Maori Studies is interdisciplinary in that it combines aspects of a considerable number of other disciplines and adds a further perspective of its own. However, despite the cross-overs with, for example, Anthropology, History, Linguistics, Art History, etc., Maori Studies provides its own unique, emic prespective which adds both depth and breadth to the study. Accordingly, research into kaupapa Maori requires a Maori model which draws from associated disciplines, forms interpretations according to the Maori world view and integrates all the various forms of evidence so that gaps in one area may be filled from another.
	Some steps towards resolution are proposed where the different forms of evidence seem to contradict, rather than complement each other. In particular the etic versus emic approach is examined with a view. Accordingly, the thesis will include an approach to the analysis and incorporation of traditional information available from: interviews; art; waiata; whakataukii; placenames; whakapapa; manuscripts and early census figures as well as the publised sources which are available. All must be compared with the contemporary oral record of past events, especially since much Maori tradition is political in nature, and the political perspective can change over time ("The Maori Camel"-paper presented to Pouhere Korero/NZHA Conference February 1996).
	(One of the particular strengths of Maori language material such as placenames, waiata, whakapapa, and whakatauki is that they have usually been repeated verbatim, often by people who hadn&#65533;t the language ability to change them. Therefore, like manuscripts they are frozen in time; unlike contemporary oral evidence where stories are retold in each generation.)
	The case studies look at the traditional Maori perspective on each of the topics and compares it with any research which has been done in Non-Maori ways. (For example, in Case Study 1., Maori knowledge which has been gathered by following the model proposed in this thesis is compared with botanical knowledge about cabbage trees.)
	Maori language material is not translated but handled in the original and discussed in Maori when a more productive discussion is thus facilitated, therefore resulting in a bi-lingual thesis. For Maori Studies to be fully accepted as having the same mana as other academic disciplines requires full acceptance of the bilingual nature of Maori Studies. However, in the iterests [sic] of wider accessibility, the majority of the discussion will be in English.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">research methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070528.123653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iwi management plans and consultation under the Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="creator">Anich, Vanessa F</field><field name="description">The Resource Management Act (hereafter &#65533;the RM Act&#65533;) has significantly changed the statutory framework for natural resource management in New Zealand. It is the result of a three year process of law reform, the largest law reform exercise ever undertaken in this country (M. F. E., 1992). It consolidates into one statute most of the laws that regulate the use of New Zealand&#65533;s natural and physical resources.
	The purpose of the RM Act is the promotion of &#65533;the sustainable management of natural and physical resources&#65533;. The focus of this Project is the introduction into the RM Act of a number of positive obligations dealing with Maori interests, the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, consultation, and iwi management plans.
	The RM Act contains provisions designed to, amongst other things, safeguard Maori heritage interests, make consultation between consent agencies and tangata whenua mandatory in the preparation of local authority plans and policy statements, provide for the delegation of authority to iwi, and to instruct decision makers to take the principles of the Treaty into account when exercising functions and duties under the act. These provisions provide new opportunities for a distinctive Maori dimension to be incorporated into resource management decision making practice.
	The ability is present within the RM Act to remove some of the barriers that have prevented Maori from participating in decisions on the management of resources. The interest of tangata whenua in natural resource management are now a part of the statutory framework. This has the effect of increasing the interaction, consultation and accountability of iwi and local government when natural resources are managed.
	The realization of the potential of these iwi provisions in the RM Act will require decision makers and local iwi to develop a working relationship by exploring models of consultation and co-management. For the relationship to be effective, it will need to be based on mutual tolerance and cooperation. The rights and duties in the relationship are complementary and rest with both parties. Long-term sucess will require a commitment from both local authorities and tangata whenua to work together in good faith and with clarity of purpose to develop kaupapa (plan, strategy) for the present and future management of natural resources.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">resource management</field><field name="subject">land use</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">natural resources</field><field name="subject">regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.125119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture change in northern Te Wai Pounamu</field><field name="creator">Barber, Ian G</field><field name="description">In the northern South Island, the area northern Te Wai Pounamu (NTWP) is defined appropriate to a regional investigation of pre-European culture change. It is argued that the Maori sequence of this region is relevant to a range of interpretative problems in New Zealand&#65533;s archaeological past.
	Preparatory to this investigation, the international and New Zealand literature on culture change is reviewed. Two primary investigative foci of change are identified in NTWP; subsistence economy and stone tool manufacturing technology. A chronological scheme of Early, Middle and Late Periods based on firmly dated ecological events and/or independent radiocarbon ages is defined so as to order the archaeological data without recourse to unproven scenarios of cultural change and association.
	The Early Period subsistence economy is assessed in some detail. An Early Period settlement focus is documented along the eastern Tasman Bay coast in proximity to meta-argillite sources. Early Period midden remains suggest that several genera of seal and moa were exploited, and that people were fishing in eastern Tasman Bay during the warmer months of the year. From the Early Period fishhook assemblages of Tasman Bay, manufacturing change is inferred related to the increasing scarcity of moa bone over time. It is argued that lower Early Period settlement of the larger northern South Island was focused on the north-eastern coast to Rangitoto (D&#65533;Urville Island), while NTWP was characterized by smaller stone working communities operating in summer.
	In contrast, moa-free middens in Awaroa Inlet and Bark Bay of the western Tasman Bay granite coast present a physical dominance of Paphies australis, and finfish species suggesting, along with the dearth of Austrovenus stutchburyi, occupation outside of the warmer summer months. These middens also present an absence of seal and a paucity of bird bone, while sharing a robust 15th-16th centuries AD radiocarbon chronology. With the dearth of all bird species from granite coast middens in general, and evidence that the less preferred kokako (Callaeas c. cinerea) was caught during the occupation of Awaroa Inlet N26/214, it is suggested that cultural regulations beyond immediate subsistence needs were also operating at this time.
	From southern Tasman Bay, the archaeological investigation of the important Appleby site N27/118 suggests that the people associated with the extensive horticultural soils of Waimea West otherwise consumed finfish and estuarine shellfish in (non-summer) season, kiore (Rattus exulans), dog or kuri (Canis familiaris), and several small evidence of Maori tradition, archaeological charcoal, and the approximately 16th century radiocarbon chronology for N27/118 and the associated Appleby gravel borrow pit N27/122 places the advent of extensive Waimea horticulture within the post-moa, lower Middle Period Maori economy. The Haulashore Island archaeological assemblage of south-eastern Tasman Bay with a similar material culture to Appleby is also bereft of seal and any diagnostic moa bone.
	This Middle Period evidence is considered in a larger comparative perspective, where the absence of seal from 15th-16th centuries Tasman Bay middens is interpreted as a factor of human predation. A secure radiocarbon chronology suggests the convergence of this loss with the diminishment and loss of selected avifauna, and the subsequent advent of large horticultural complexes in the northern South Island compensated for the loss of faunal calories in a seasonally economy and a managed ecology.
	The evidence of stone tool use is also reviewed in some detail for NTWP, following the definition of an adze typology appropriate to the classification of meta-argillite tools. It is clear that meta-argillite is the dominant material of adze and (non-adze) flake tool manufacture throughout the Maori sequence of NTWP, while granite coast quartz remains generally subdominant. Beyound the apparent loss of the laterally-hafted adze, the evidence of adze change is generally subdominant. Beyond the apparent loss of the laterally-hafted adze, the evidence of adze change is generally reflected in shifting typological proportions, and in new manufacturing technologies and dressing techniques. Functional change may be inferred in the loss over time of large meta-argillite points and blade tools associated respectively with the manufacture of one-piece moa bone fishhooks and moa and seal butchery. The exclusive identification of hammer-dressed adzes with hump backs and steep bevels in Middle Period assemblages is related to the advent of horticultural intensification. More generally, adzes of the upper Early and Middle Periods are increasingly characterized by round sections, while hammer-dressing is employed more frequently and extensively reduced from riverine meta-argillite and recycled banks. Collectively, these changes reflect a developing emphasis on economy and opportunistic exploitation. From this interpretation, and evidence that meta-argillite adze length and the size of high quality Ohana source flakes diminish over time, it is suggested that accessible, high quality and appropriately shaped meta-argillite rock became increasingly scarce through intensive quarry manufacture.
	In conclusion, the coincidence of diminishing rock and faunal resources over time is related in a speculative anthropological model of culture change. It is proposed that the 14th-16th centuries Maori economy of NTWP, and by implication and inference, many other regions of New Zealand, was characterized by a resource crisis which either precipitated or reinforced a broader trajectory of culture change. It is suggested that influential leadears perceived a linkage in the loss of high quality rock and important subsistence fauna at this time, and that distinctive technologies, institutions and ideologies of Middle Period Maori society were influenced by, and/or developed from, this perception. Finally, it is recommended that the data of an archaeological Maori culture sequence be ordered and tested within a radiocarbon based chronological scheme, rather than the still generally used model of &#65533;Archaic&#65533; and &#65533;Classic&#65533; cultural periods. It is also suggested that New Zealand archaeologists should look beyond the functional-ecological imperative to consider more holistic anthropological explanations of change in the pre-European Maori past, with a focus on integrated regional sequences.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Nelson</field><field name="subject">Marlborough</field><field name="subject">Te Waipounamu</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070531.135029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of alcohol exposure in early gestation on brain development</field><field name="creator">Li, Yuhong</field><field name="description">Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, has been extensively studied in the human. Animal studies show that alcohol exposure during very early development may result in severe brain damage, often incompatible with a postnatal life. However, for surviving offspring it is unknown whether they suffer long term brain damage. The final assembly of the mature brain results from a controlled balance between proliferation of glial and neuronal precursors and programmed cell death. The overall aim of the current study was to use a physiologically relevant mouse model to assess the acute and long-term effects of binge alcohol exposure on the early embryo, to simulate human pregnancy at the third week of gestation when pregnancy may be undetected. 
 A number of paradigms were used to assess the acute dose-response effect, the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) profile and the extent of cell death following alcohol exposure on gestational day (G) 7.5. The exposure paradigms were single binge IG6.5, IG4.5, IP4.5, or an extended binge IG4.5+, IG3.0+. Two control groups were Con6.5 and Con4.5+. Acute cell death was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), activated caspase-3 staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Cell proliferation was investigated using S-phase immuno-labeling, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) birthdating and immuno-detection (BrdU/anti-BrdU). The long-term effects were investigated at G18.5 and postnatal day (PN) 60. Unbiased stereological methods were used to assess the effect of ethanol exposure at G7.5 on neocortical volume, cell number and density of neurons, glial cells, and capillary cells at PN60. 
 The first principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation resulted in acute apoptotic cell death in the ectoderm of the mouse embryo. Cell death was dependent on both peak BAC and the duration of elevated BAC. Significant increased cell death (TUNEL labeling) was observed in groups IG6.5 (9.43 &#65533; 2.08%) and IG4.5+ (8.97 &#65533; 2.12%) compared with control groups Con6.5 (2.14 &#65533; 0.09%) and Con4.5+ (2.81 &#65533; 0.36%). There was no significant increased cell death in ethanol exposed groups IG4.5 (3.43 &#65533; 0.45%), IP4.5 (3.68 &#65533; 0.67%), or IG3.0+ (1.72 &#65533; 0.24%). TEM analysis revealed that cell death exhibited characteristics of the apoptotic pathway. 
 The second principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation resulted in acute arrested proliferation in the ectoderm of the mouse embryo. The S-phase proliferation was significantly decreased within the whole ectoderm in the ethanol exposed group IG6.5 (45.58 &#65533; 2.34%) compared with control group Con6.5 (62.08 &#65533; 3.11%). 
 The third principal finding of the present study was that binge ethanol exposure during gastrulation induced the long term effect of laminate disorganization in the neocortex. The incidence of abnormal lamination was 87.5% in IG6.5 compared with 16.7% in IG3.0+ and 14.3% in Con6.5. Although ethanol exposure increased embryonic reabsorption, decreased litter size, and increased abnormal offspring, neocortical volume, and the total number of neurons, glial cells, and capillary cells was not affected. The total number (10&#8310;) of neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells respectively was 12.221 &#65533; 0.436, 4.865 &#65533; 0.167, and 2.874 &#65533; 0.234 in IG6.5; 11.987 &#65533; 0.416, 4.942 &#65533; 0.133, and 2.922 &#65533; 0.130 in IG3.0+; and 11.806 &#65533; 0.368, 5.166 &#65533; 0.267, and 3.284 &#65533; 0.217 in controls, at PN60. 
 These results provide important information pertinent to fetal outcome for those women who drink heavily in early pregnancy. The results also demonstrate the importance of the pattern of ethanol exposure and blood alcohol concentration in determining the magnitude of ethanol&#65533;s teratogenic impact. Ethanol exposure on G7.5 that resulted in a high transient BAC, induced disorganized neocortical lamination, indicative of a permanent structural change. This disruption may result in altered neocortical function and requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fetal alcohol syndrome</field><field name="subject">fetus</field><field name="subject">chemicals</field><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">effect</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070502.100319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience and vulnerability in communities around Mt Taranaki</field><field name="creator">Finnis, Kristen Kay</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to examine the resilience and vulnerability of Taranaki communities to volcanic hazards, and to propose a strategy to ensure the safety and longevity of Taranaki residents in the event of an eruption. 
 Mt Taranaki is a dormant volcano that is surrounded by a ring plain populated by over 100,000 people. The volcano has had an average eruptive cycle of 330 years, with the last eruption dated at ~1755 AD. Hazards include ash fall, lahars, debris avalanches and pyroclastic density currents. Inglewood, Stratford and Opunake are the largest population centres located in moderate to high hazard zones, and for this reason were chosen as the study communities. 
 Resilience is defined as the capacity to respond to a hazard event by physically and psychologically recovering, adapting to, or changing to similar or better conditions than those experienced before the event. Vulnerability is defined to be people&#65533;s incapacity to cope with a hazardous event as a result of their personal characteristics. A person&#65533;s vulnerability and resilience is influenced by demographic variables, socio-cognitive variables and preparedness. 
 Inglewood, Stratford and Opunake adults have good self-efficacy and action-coping use, fair risk perceptions, outcome expectancy and response efficacy, but poor understanding of event timing relative to eruption probability, critical awareness, preparedness and information-seeking intentions and preparedness levels. Preparedness is found to be influenced by residents&#65533; intentions to prepare, which in turn are influenced by critical awareness, action-coping and outcome expectancy. 
 Taranaki students have a fair awareness of hazard and knowledge of correct response behaviours to various hazards. Preparedness, in terms of preparedness measures undertaken, emergency plans made and emergency practices in place, is low. Students who have participated in hazard-education programmes have a better knowledge of response behaviours, lower levels of hazard-related fear, and reported higher level of preparedness. 
 Spatial analyses, carried out to determine the geographic distribution of at-risk groups within the study communities, showed that the areas most at-risk tend to be those with the highest population densities. The spatial analysis was not as beneficial as expected, due to small data sets, but did provide some results to be considered as a basis for further research. 
 Effective public education can be achieved when delivered to a set of guidelines, such as providing information regularly through multiple media and sources, ensuring consistent messages, targeting information to at-risk groups and monitoring programme effectiveness. Community capacity building projects decrease aspects of vulnerability and build resilience by working at a local scale and targeting at-risk groups. Psychological preparedness education helps citizens to mentally prepare for an event and should be a component of all projects.

The aims of this thesis were 1) to investigate oral absorption mechanisms of mitoquinone in Caco-2 cell monolayers and in a rat intestinal tissue model; 2) to investigate the correlation between chemical structure and permeability of mitoquinone analogues in Caco-2 cell monolayers; and 3) to explore the hypothesis that active transport and/or drug metabolism contribute to the pharmacokinetics of oral mitoquinone in rat. 
 In Caco-2 studies, transport of mitoquinone was polarized with the apparent permeability (P[app]) from basolateral (BL) to apical (AP) (P[appBL to AP]) being &gt;2.5-fold the P[app] from AP to BL (P[appAP to BL]). The P[appBL to AP] value decreased by 26%, 31% and 61% by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors verapamil 100 [mu]M, cyclosporine A (CsA) 10 [mu]M and CsA 30 [mu]M, respectively, whereas the P[appAP to BL] increased 71% by CsA 30 [mu]M. Some of the intracellular mitoquinone was reduced to mitoquinol and subsequently metabolized to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Apical effluxes of mitoquinol sulfate and mitoquinol glucuronide conjugates were significantly decreased by cyclosporine A 30 [mu]M and the breast cancer receptor protein (BCRP) inhibitor, reserpine 25 [mu]M, respectively. In the presence of 4% bovine serum albumin on the BL side, the P[appAP to BL] was 4.52 &#65533; 0.92 x 10&#8310; cm/s. Based on a absorption-disposition model, F[a] value of mitoquinone in human is estimated to be 56%. 
 A bellshaped relationship exists between the Caco-2 permeability of mitoquinone analogues and their lipophilicity. Permeability of mitoquinone analogues initially increases as lipophilicity increase, reaches a maximum, and then decreases due to significant cellular accumulation and active efflux. The physicochemical parameters of mitoquinone and its analogues (such as log P or polar surface area) alone do not predict their permeability across the cell membranes. 
 The bidirectional transport of mitoquinone displays polarity across rat ileal mucosa. The P[app] from s to m (P[app s to m) of mitoquinone decreased and P[app m to s] increased but not significantly by P-gp inhibitor CsA 30 [mu]M. The tissue accumulation of mitoquinone was ~16% of the total amount of mitoquinone added. In addition, several phase I and one phase II metabolites generated by rat ileum tissue were detected. 
 Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that mitoquinone was poorly (~24%) but rapidly absorbed and conjugated after oral administration. It was quickly excreted as unchanged drug and as its glucuronides (the major metabolites in rat) into intestine where it was reabsorbed. P-gp inhibition studies in rat indicate that inhibition of P-gp may increase the intestinal absorption of mitoquinone, but cannot change its oral bioavailability due to increased first-pass phase II metabolism and decreased enterohepatic recycling. 
 In conclusion, mitoquinone is poorly absorbed in rat but may be well absorbed in human. The barrier functions of intracellular metabolism and the action of P-gp to oral absorption of mitoquinone in human may be less significant, whereas P-gp play an important role in the absorption and disposition of mitoquinone in rat in vivo. These results, together with those from its analogues, demonstrate that the actual absorption profile of a compound depends on its intrinsic membrane permeability, transporter affinity, metabolizing enzyme affinity and plasma protein binding affinity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antioxidants</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="subject">degeneration</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070615.135534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the nature and timing of early events in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="creator">Drake, Kylie Marie</field><field name="description">Understanding the nature and timing of leukaemogenic events during the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) will enable intervention that could prevent ALL in the future. We hypothesised that 9p21 deletion in childhood ALL may unmask predisposing genetic events that would allow us to determine the "nature" of initiating events in childhood ALL; whereas the inclusion, or exclusion, of random &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides in normal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements from the developing fetus and the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in fetal lymphocytes may allow us to unmask the developmental window during which the first transforming leukaemic event occurs in a pre-leukaemic B cell. 
 The most frequent genetic abnormality in childhood ALL is deletion of chromosome 9p21, with the minimal region of deletion including the CDKN2-locus, making genes at this locus candidates for a predisposing genetic event in ALL. To determine whether genomic imprinting might be involved in ALL at the 9p21 locus we investigated the imprinting status of the candidate genes CDKN2A, CDKN2B and ARF. No evidence for genomic imprinting of ARF was found in this study. Because no expressed polymorphisms could be identified for CDKN2B, and CDKN2A expression was too low in normal tissues, the imprinting status of these genes could not be evaluated. Furthermore investigations in our laboratory have been unable to find genomic imprinting at any of these genes in mice. However, we have shown variation in allelic expression of ARF, which suggests a role for ARF haploinsufficiency in the onset of childhood ALL. 
 A key feature of early human fetal lymphoid development is the absence of random &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides between the rearranged V[H], D[H] and J[H] gene segments. The addition of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at these junctions requires the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). TdT is reported to not be expressed during early fetal lymphopoiesis but has been observed by the end of the first trimester, but data are sparse. 
 The reported absence of N nucleotides in the majority of childhood ALLs suggests an early fetal origin. By defining the window-in-time during which TdT-negative B cell development occurs, we will be able to refine the timing of the origin of the B cells that give rise to ALL. Therefore we have sequenced and analysed the V[H]-DJ[H] and D[H]-J[H] junctions from immunoglobulin rearrangements in developing B cells in normal human fetuses aged from 5.1 to 11 weeks gestation. 
 In this study 73 fetal IgH gene rearrangements were amplified from 21 different fetal liver samples. Only eight of the seventy-three rearrangements (11%) analysed in this study had no &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at the N1 (D[H]-J[H]) junction. This finding contrasts with the 24-28% of fetal rearrangements with no &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides that have been reported in the literature. Furthermore, &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides were shown to be present in the earliest sample, 5.1 weeks gestation. TdT expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry at 7.3 weeks and by RT-PCR at 8.3 weeks. B cell development in the fetal liver was detected as early as 6.5 weeks using flow cytometric analysis. 
 Then, IgH gene rearrangements from 99 cases of childhood ALL were analysed. In total, 134 clone-specific IgH gene rearrangements were examined in this study. No association was found between the number of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides from complete and incomplete rearrangements at either the N1 (D[H]-J[H]) or N2 (V[H]-DJ[H]) junctions. Nor was any association observed between ALLs from children [less than or equal to] 3 years of age and those &gt;3 years of age at diagnosis. These findings indicate that ALL IgH rearrangements do not have the paucity of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides that has been previously reported. 
 The findings in this thesis suggest that there is no TdT-negative timepoint during B cell development and that there is no paucity of &#65533;N&#65533; nucleotides at the N1 junction in either fetal or childhood ALL IgH gene rearrangements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">acute</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">lymphoblastic</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070719.131918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image and imagination : perspectives on Athenian naval influence in the fifth century BC</field><field name="creator">Turner, Gordon R. B</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Athenian navy in the fifth century BC from the standpoint of its image, in terms of perception and reputation, in comparison and contrast to its fact, in terms of actuality and truth. It investigates features of cultural history based around and arising from the contemporary state of mind about Athens&#65533; naval ships and sailors, from the points of view of Athenians and outsiders. Its hypothesis is that the supremacy of Athens&#65533; navy and the integrity of Athens&#65533; naval society in the fifth century were partly products of the Athenian imagination, and in turn gave rise to a reputation for Athens&#65533; navy and sailors that itself helped to fulfil Athens&#65533; naval and related tasks. Methodologically, the arguments of the thesis are developed 'from the inside out', as they are derived essentially from the primary sources, and then engage with secondary sources where appropriate. The approach is holistic, with source material derived principally from history, literature, art, architecture, and on-site analysis, with extensive illustrations. The thesis is expansive. It begins by examining the perception of Athens&#65533; naval supremacy and invincibility by Athenians and outsiders, and the impact that this had upon Athens&#65533; ability to achieve her naval and related objectives. It then looks inwardly upon Athens herself, in order to assess Athens&#65533; own social attitude towards her naval oarsmen and their base and home at the Piraeus. In this respect, the thesis investigates the development of artistic and literary depictions of the oarsmen of Athenian ships from the eighth to the fifth centuries, and the conclusions to be drawn from their visibility or its lack. It then considers the relationship between Athens and the Piraeus, beginning with the foundations of the image of unity before contrasting that image with the reality of naval division, in terms of Ionianism, autochthony, administration, politics, cult, and the deceit of Athenicity. The thesis then casts its net from the Piraeus across the Aegean Sea, by assessing the roles of Samos and Delos in the perception of naval Athens. Lastly, the thesis examines a topic that combines those of Athens&#65533; navy, the Piraeus, and overseas involvement. This topic is the importance of the reputations of Athens&#65533; navy and of the Piraeus in overseas trade with Athens&#65533; allies and particularly non-allies; and, including social and legal considerations, for influential Athenian citizens who wished to protect their investments in maritime loans for the transit of essential goods to Athens. The thesis concludes that the influence of the Athenian navy was indeed a product of image as much as of fact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Athens</field><field name="subject">Greece</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">naval</field><field name="subject">triremes</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070814.155342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft-sediment benthos of Aramoana and Blueskin Bay (Otago, New Zealand) and effects of dredge-spoil disposal</field><field name="creator">Paavo, Brian Lee</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to broadly describe and understand the sediment benthos of a shallow-water coastal area (Aramoana Beach - Heyward Point - Blueskin Bay) near the entrance to Otago Harbour, a system largely representative for southeastern New Zealand. Benthic assemblages were examined in relation to gradients of wave exposure and disturbance, sediment type and bathymetry, and dredge-spoil disposal. 
 Sediment and macrofaunal surveys in autumn and spring 2003 found little change in sediment texture gradients from historical studies and a lack of vertical stratification. Macrobenthic samples from spring produced significantly higher abundances of three numerically dominant phyla (Arthropoda, Annelida, and Mollusca) and higher taxon richness compared to autumn. Within water depths of 6-30 m, abundance, richness, and diversity increased with depth. Multivariate analyses identified similar assemblages among deeper sites, despite sediment textural differences, whereas distinct assemblages were found in the shallow portions of the three areas. Meiofaunal abundance patterns did not reflect those of macrofauna, possibly indicating greater vertical penetration of sediments in these hydrodynamic environments. Several new kinorhynch taxa were found. 
 In a field manipulation, part of the Aramoana dredge-spoil dumpground was protected from spoil disposal for an extended period followed by experimental dumping of sandy and muddy spoil. Macrofaunal samples were collected before dumping and at nine sites &lt; 119 d after disposal. Water velocities at the sediment-water interface were compared to a local sediment disturbance model. Dumpground samples were depauperate in individuals and taxa compared to an area protected from dumping for &gt; 180 d. A drop in abundance and a dissimilar community coincided with muddy spoil, but fine sediments were dispersed within 26 d and macrofaunal assemblages recovered to the pre-existing state. Sandy spoil, while not altering native sediment textures, had a more prolonged impact due to transplantation of macrofauna from the dredged area that persisted for &lt; 41 d after disposal. Side-scan sonar mapping indicated that the disposal footprint model used approximated the extent of sandy spoil impacts well, while local conditions spread muddy sediments beyond the initial impact site. 
 A novel sediment profile imaging device was constructed that has many advantages over existing devices for spoil mound studies and habitat mapping: it is smaller, can be manually deployed from small boats, is cheaper, and can be modified to work in almost any soft sediment. 
 Studies of one dominant taxon, the gastropod Zethalia zelandica, showed it was better able to survive sand burial than mud burial, did not vary in overall activity through a range of 5-14&#65533; C, and contributed a large proportion of biomass of its community. 
 The spoil disposal strategy used does not appear as environmentally neutral as originally thought. Only muds are effectively dispersed whereas coarser sediments accumulate, affecting physical and biological benthic processes of a wider area. Two mitigation strategies were evaluated using a heuristic model. Reducing the disposal area and spreading mud disposal events over a longer time span may be an effective interim strategy. Overall, the studies will help guide management of the area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benthos</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Blueskin Bay</field><field name="subject">Aramoana</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Otago Harbour</field><field name="subject">dredging</field><field name="subject">spoil</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">waste</field><field name="subject">disposal</field><field name="subject">ocean</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20070928.161657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of protein-phospholipid interactions in implantable delivery systems</field><field name="creator">Tantipolphan, Ruedeeporn</field><field name="description">Purpose: This thesis aimed to gain a better understanding of the effects of salts in modifying in vitro phase behaviour of lecithin and cholesterol solid implants and to obtain further information on in vitro protein release and stability. 
 Methods: Raman spectroscopy and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to investigate lecithin-cholesterol molecular interactions as a function of method of preparation. Lipid-salt interactions were studied by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy using principal component analysis (PCA). In vitro release of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a model protein, from lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol implants comprising 10 and 30% NaCl and CaCl&#8322; were performed. Size exclusion (SE) HPLC was used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the released BSA. On hydration, changes in phase behaviour and implant morphology were studied by ATR spectroscopy and light microscopy. SE-HPLC, ATR and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to evaluate the structure of unreleased BSA. Protein adsorption on lipid films was studied by flow through ATR spectroscopy. Increased amide II peak area upon recirculation of BSA in salt solutions over hydrated lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol films cast on ZnSe prisms was used to quantify the deposition of BSA onto the lipid surfaces. 
 Results: Shifts in the Raman spectra suggested the lecithin headgroup may be involved in lecithin-cholesterol interactions. Greater R&#65533; and root mean square error of cross validation in the calibration curves of physical mixing and heating (120&#65533;C) methods reflected poor mixing in these preparations. The mean absolute residue and mean Mahalanobis distance values from the physical mixing and granulation methods indicated their spectral similarity and comparable level of lecithin-cholesterol interactions. Calcium exhibited stronger affinity for phospholipids than sodium and it induced headgroup hydration and reorganisation upon binding. PCA of ATR spectra was sensitive to cholesterol addition, calcium binding and method of preparation whilst PCA of Raman spectra only differentiated the presence of cholesterol. In vitro release of BSA from implants produced from wet granulation mixtures of lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol in the absence of salt showed retention of a high monomer content and the release profiles were similar to the literature. Cholesterol increased the swelling, induced phase transformation of lecithin and, subsequently, reduced the BSA release. Salts only slightly modified the BSA release from the lecithin implants. In contrast, for lecithin:cholesterol matrices salts greatly enhanced implant swelling, induced the formation of hydrated lecithin of heterogeneous size and inhibited the in vitro BSA release. Analyses of the protein showed increased aggregation of BSA with a high retention of native structure while retained within the swollen matrices. ATR spectra suggested that salts promoted protein adsorption onto hydrated lecithin surfaces and the effects depend on salt types (NaCl &gt; CaCl&#8322;) and concentration (0.1 M &gt; 1.0 M) but not on lecithin:cholesterol surfaces. 
 Conclusion: PLSR and PCA can be used to investigate molecular interactions in the solid lipid matrices. In lecithin:cholesterol implants, salts modified the phase behaviour of lecithin which resulted in enhanced swelling, formation of hydrated lecithin of altered morphology and inhibition of in vitro BSA release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salt</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">lecithin</field><field name="subject">cholesterol</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">Drug delivery devices</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20071218.162425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a topical growth factor formualtion for wound healing</field><field name="creator">Braund, Rhiannon</field><field name="description">Purpose: The aim of this thesis was to investigate a suitable formulation for the topical delivery of growth factors to chronic wounds, and then to determine the concentrations reached within an animal wound model. A secondary aim was to determine if the chosen growth factor was present at levels able to stimulate the production of other cytokines, specifically IL-1&#946; and MCP-1. 
 Methods: An in vitro testing apparatus was designed and made and the release of model actives [bromophenol blue (BPB) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)] from gels and films of hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) (E4M CR, K4M CR and E10M CR) was determined. In this study, Fibroblast Growth Factor -2 (FGF-2) (0.3 [mu]g) was incorporated into three formulations (solution, gel and dried gel film on Melolin[TM] backing) and together with a control formulation were administered to punch biopsy wounds in rats. The in vivo release was followed over three time periods (two, five and eight hours) and the amount of FGF-2 at various wound depths was quantified by ELISA. Two biological markers IL-1&#946; and MCP-1 were quantified using ELISA. The FGF-2 was additionally tagged with a fluorescent dye so that visualisation of the penetration could be obtained via confocal microsopy. 
 Results: For the HPMC gels, the more viscous gel (E10M) provided a greater diffusional barrier and slowed the release of BPB (12 &#65533; 3.5 [mu]g/min compared with 16 &#65533; 1.7 [mu]g/min and 18 &#65533; 1.4 [mu]g/min for K4M and E4M respectively). However, when HPMC was formulated as a dried film a burst release was seen and release of BPB was slowest from the more rapidly hydrating K4M. With the larger model active HRP, there was a slower diffusion through the gel barrier formed upon film hydration, such that time of 100% release was up to 300 minutes compared to approximately 60 minutes for BPB. When the film was dried onto a supportive backing, the initial burst release was minimised as the film did not break apart on contact with the wound, and hence film integrity was maintained and release prolonged. The in vivo studies showed that, two hours after application, the highest concentration of FGF-2 was seen in the surface granulation tissue of rats that received the solution formulation (2280 &#65533; 790 pg/g). The concentration decreased with increasing tissue depth but was significantly greater than the saline control in the surface granulation and subcutaneous fat layers (p&lt;0.05). Tissue concentrations following application of the gel and film formulations were only marginally greater than control in the surface granulation layer. After eight hours, rats that received the solution retained elevated surface tissue concentrations (surface granulation and subcutaneous fat) of FGF-2. Repeated measures ANOVA using a general linear model showed statistically significant differences in the mean FGF-2 level with respect to formulation and length of time of application of the formulation (p&lt;0.05). In terms of other cytokines, there was a release of both IL-1&#946; and MCP-1 in all groups, immediately post-wounding, probably in response to cellular damage. After eight hours, the film formulation appeared to elevate IL-1&#946; levels which may be useful to drive wound healing. Confocal microscopy images showed diffuse distribution of FGF-2 eight hours after application of the solution formulation after eight hours and that with the gel formulation FGF-2 initially aggregated at the wound surface. 
 Conclusion: In vitro experiments investigating the effect of hydration rate and viscosity of HPLC polymers allowed a formulation to be chosen for further in vivo study. Elevated FGF-2 could be measured in superficial wound tissues up to eight hours after application of a solution. However, application of a comparable amount of FGF-2 in HPMC gels or films did not produce appreciable elevations in FGF-2 in wound tissues, although confocal microscopy indicated the penetration of FGF-2 into the wound for up to eight hours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wound</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">injuries</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">factors</field><field name="subject">drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080228.135050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and improving the cryopreservation of pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) oocytes via the use of two approaches : modification of an existing cryopreservation protocol and manipulation of the lipis fraction of the oocytes</field><field name="creator">Salinas-Flores, Liliana</field><field name="description">Cryopreservation of gametes is a valuable tool for the fast-growing aquaculture industry in New Zealand. In the present study, research was aimed to improve the cryopreservation of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) oocytes. For this, two main approaches were used: the modification of an existing published (standard) cryopreservation protocol for oyster oocytes and the modification of the oocytes themselves prior to cryopreservation. The objectives in the chapters of this thesis were: (a) determination of the cryobiological characteristics of oyster oocytes; (b) assessment and reduction of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in oocytes; and (c) modification of the lipid fraction (cholesterol and fatty acids) of oocytes prior to cryopreservation. 
 Knowledge of the membrane permeability parameters in response to concentrations of water and ethylene glycol (EG), the influence of temperature upon these parameters, and the osmotic tolerance limits of oyster oocytes were used to develop computer models that simulated the cellular volume changes that oocytes underwent during EG addition and removal. The models predicted that when one part of EG was added in one step to one part of oocyte suspension and equilibrated for 20 min at 20 &#65533;C, similar volume changes in oocytes would be obtained, compared to a more complicated multi-step addition method. This method of addition resulted in similar post-thaw fertilization rates to those obtained by using the multi-step addition method, thus reducing oocyte handling. 
 Cryomicroscopy was used to assess the effect of cooling rates and EG concentration on the temperature at which oocytes underwent IIF. It was found that IIF occurred at higher subzero temperatures when fast cooling rates were used (30 and 5 &#65533;C min&#8315;&#65533;) and at EG concentrations ranged between 0 and 15%. At a relatively slower cooling rate of 0.3 &#65533;C min&#8315;&#65533; and with 10% EG, which are the conditions employed in the standard cryopreservation protocol, no IIF occurred. 
 The steps of the standard protocol that were more likely to cause oocyte damage were identified by evaluating the fertilization rate of oocytes at each step. Results showed that oocytes were most damaged by cooling them to -35 &#65533;C and followed by plunging them in liquid nitrogen. Contrary to what had been observed under the cryomicroscope, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that all oocytes cryopreserved by the standard protocol contained cytoplasmic ice. In addition, it was also observed that oocytes were at two developmental stages when frozen (prophase and metaphase I). These observations prompted the development of alternative cooling programmes aimed to reduce intracellular ice. The effect of cooling rate, plunge temperature and time held at the plunge temperature were thus evaluated, based on post-thaw fertilization rate of oocytes. Overall, neither the cooling rate nor the holding time had an effect on oocyte fertility. However, the plunge temperature had an effect, where oocytes plunged at -60 &#65533;C had lower post-thaw fertilization rates than oocytes plunged at -35 &#65533;C. Through the slowing of the cooling rate, lengthening of the holding time and lowering of the plunge temperature, it was possible to reduce the amount of ice in the cytoplasm. However, the reduction of intracellular ice did not improve the post-thaw fertilization rate of the oocytes; on the contrary, post-thaw fertilization decreased notoriously. From these results, it can be suggested that oyster oocytes are more likely to be damaged by exposure to high intra and extracellular solute concentration than IIF during cryopreservation. 
 In an effort to modify the lipid content of oyster oocytes prior to cryopreservation and thus, making them more resistant during cryopreservation, oocytes were incubated in solutions that would add or remove cholesterol or in solutions rich in long chain fatty acids (EPA or DHA). Oocytes incubated in cholesterol-rich solutions showed a positive uptake of fluorescently labelled cholesterol and this effect was dose dependent. Nevertheless, this uptake did not improve the post-thaw fertilization rate nor did it increase the total cholesterol content of the oocytes. When oocytes were incubated in non-conjugated or conjugated EPA or DHA, no increase in the proportion of these fatty acids was identified in the fatty acid profiles of whole oocytes and no improvement of the post-thaw fertilization rate was recorded. 
 Given that there was no uptake of fatty acids from the incubation media by the oocytes, a different approach was taken. This involved the supplementation of lipid-rich diets to the oyster broodstock during gametogenesis (cold-conditioning) and vitellogenesis (warm-conditioning). Despite results showing that lipid content and, indeed, fatty acid profile was altered through the diet, the results also showed that fresh oocytes from broodstock fed during cold-conditioning did not show any improvement in their fertilization rates, nor did they benefit from a lipid-rich diet during warm-conditioning. On the other hand, cryopreserved oocytes did have higher post-thaw fertilisation rates when broodstock were fed during cold-conditioning and, although no effect was found from feeding broodstock with either of the lipid-rich diets during warm-conditioning, trends indicated that a diet consisting of fresh microalgae or the commercial supplement Algamac would yield the highest post-thaw fertilization rates. 
 This thesis has furthered the understanding of some of the factors that determine cryosurvival in oyster oocytes and has demonstrated that both physical and biological issues must be taken into consideration for cryopreservation. Specifically, the results in this thesis helped to modify an empirically developed cryopreservation protocol for Pacific oyster oocytes. In addition, the results also showed strong evidence of the survival of oyster oocytes to intracellular ice and highlighted the importance of supplying the broodstock with lipid-rich food during the periods of gamete formation and maturation in order to obtain oocytes that are more amenable to cryopreservation. These benefits could be of significant practical importance and may be extended for the development or refinement of cryopreservation protocols for other shellfish species of commercial importance to the aquaculture industry of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cryopreservation</field><field name="subject">organs</field><field name="subject">tissues</field><field name="subject">ovum</field><field name="subject">cells</field><field name="subject">Pacific oyster</field><field name="subject">germplasm resources</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080305.143446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blessed is he who keeps the words of prophecy in this book : an intra-textual reading of the apocalypse as parenesis</field><field name="creator">Frank, Patrik Immanuel</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore the implications of a parenetic reading of the Book of Revelation as a whole, rather than merely of the seven messages in which this is more commonly regarded as the primary purpose of the text. It examines the validity of this approach in relation to the book&#65533;s claims about its purpose in the original communication event of which its text is a witness and its effectiveness in addressing hermeneutical issues in key passages of the book and argues that attention to the function of parenesis facilitates readings of Revelation which connect more directly with the intention of the book free from the need to decipher obscure coded references to past or future history. 
 Drawing from the text of the Apocalypse a twofold hermeneutical strategy is developed and exemplified by application to key passages of the book. The first aspect of this reading strategy is focussed on the proposed parenetic nature of the book. In an examination of Revelation&#65533;s introductory and concluding passages it is argued that as a coherent unity they form a frame around the book. This frame serves to establish the perspective from which the whole book may be read. It does so by giving rise to the expectation that the whole book contains parenetic exhortation to faithfulness in light of the imminent parousia. Consequently this thesis proceeds to interpret the Book of Revelation by focussing primarily on how the various images in the book&#65533;s body (4:1-22:9) as well as the explicit parenesis in the seven messages serve to communicate this parenetic exhortation to the original addressees. 
 The second aspect of interpretation seeks to facilitate scholarly analysis of the parenesis expected to be contained in Revelation&#65533;s body with systematic regard for the individual situation of each of the addressees of the book, as documented in the comparatively accessible seven messages. To this end an intra-textual hermeneutic is employed. It builds on an examination of the links between the various parts of Revelation which is part of the examination of both the book&#65533;s frame and the seven messages. This intra-textual reading utilizes the many links between the seven messages and Revelation&#65533;s body by allowing them to play a determinative role in the investigation of an image&#65533;s parenetic implications. 
 In order to further explore the validity of a parentic reading, the intra-textual principle is applied to two central parts of Revelation&#65533;s body, the Babylon vision (Rev 17-19:3) and the seal, trumpet and bowl visions (Rev 6, 8, 9, 11:15-19, 15, 16). 
 In this reading, the Babylon vision is read not as a general critique of the church&#65533;s pagan environment but as a divine commentary on the concrete threats and temptations with which the churches of the seven messages were confronted. In God&#65533;s judgment of Babylon those who suffer under her violence against Christians are promised vindication and are thus encouraged to maintain their faithful witness as citizens of the New Jerusalem. The citizens of Babylon however are exhorted to repent and leave her behind, becoming citizens of the New Jerusalem and thus escaping Babylon&#65533;s demise. 
 The seal, trumpet and bowl visions are interpreted as illustrating the dividing line between what constitutes faithful witness to Christ on the one hand and heed to satanic deception on the other. Faithfulness even to the point of death is expected of the followers of the Lamb; the inhabitants of the earth are exhorted to repent from their affiliation with the beast and give glory to God. 
 Thus such an intra-textual reading of Revelation as parenesis offers a strategy for reading the book in a way that is relevant for the Christian church beyond the limits of end-time phantasms on the one hand and mere historic interest on the other hand and so might facilitate the emergence of the message of the book from the obscurity in which it appears to be hidden to a significant proportion of its contemporary readers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">New Testament</field><field name="subject">Revelation</field><field name="subject">Babylon (Extinct city)</field><field name="subject">Jerusalem</field><field name="subject">visions</field><field name="subject">witness bearing (Christianity)</field><field name="subject">eschatology</field><field name="subject">biblical teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080506.163527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food-based strategies to improve dietary iron intake and biochemical iron status in 12-24 month old New Zealand children</field><field name="creator">Szymlek-Gay, Ewa Anna</field><field name="description">Adequate nutrition is fundamental to optimal physical and cognitive growth in the second year of life. Toddlers, however, are particularly vulnerable to poor nutrition due to their high nutrient needs in relation to their body size and energy intakes. Nutrient-dense diets are therefore essential during this period. However, no practical quantitative food-based dietary guidelines directed at this age group are available to help caregivers choose nutrient-rich foods for their toddler. Such guidelines are needed not only to ensure adequate intakes of all nutrients during the period of dietary transition from infant to family foods, but also to emphasise intakes of nutrients for which toddlers are at particular risk of deficiency. Biochemical evidence suggests that iron nutrition requires special attention in New Zealand toddlers. The overall aim of this thesis was to design and assess the efficacy of practical food-based strategies for toddlers to ensure optimal nutritional status of 12-24 month old New Zealand children, with a specific focus on iron nutrition. To achieve these overall aims, the research was carried out in three stages. 
 In the first stage, secondary data analysis of food intake data for New Zealand toddlers identified the foods commonly consumed by New Zealand toddlers, the serving sizes and frequency of consumption of these foods, and the nutrients that New Zealand toddlers are at risk of consuming in suboptimal amounts. The food intake data were obtained from 3-day weighed food intakes that had been collected on non-consecutive days in an earlier community-based cross-sectional survey of 188 randomly selected non-breastfeeding 12-24 month old urban South Island New Zealand children. In addition to describing the food consumption patterns of New Zealand toddlers, the secondary data analysis also identified that nearly 40% of New Zealand toddlers were at risk of suboptimal iron intakes. 
 The results of these analyses were used in the second stage of the thesis to develop three food-based strategies. To do this a 4-phase approach based on linear and goal programming was used to design and hypothetically evaluate three sets of food-based strategies for 12-24 month old non-breastfeeding New Zealand children, and to identify the key problem nutrients for each set of strategies. The three sets of strategies were based on: (1) all foods consumed by toddlers including iron-fortified infant and toddler foods, (2) family foods only, or (3) family foods that are not fortified with iron. The mathematical modelling confirmed that iron was the key problem nutrient in the diets of New Zealand toddlers. The analysis showed that only food-based strategies that included a recommendation for the replacement of non-fortified cow&#65533;s milk with an iron-fortified toddler milk (500 mL), i.e. strategy set 1, achieved the Australian-New Zealand Recommended Dietary Intakes for all nutrients, including iron. In fact, inclusion of a recommendation for a substantially increased consumption of flesh foods was identified as the only possible alternative to the iron-fortified toddler milk recommendation for improving iron nutrition in New Zealand toddlers. Although the set of strategies including this flesh food recommendation did not provide as much total iron as those including the iron-fortified toddler milk recommendation, the bioavailability of the iron is likely to be greater because flesh foods provide highly bioavailable haem iron (red meat being a particularly rich source) and have an enhancing effect on the absorption of non-haem iron. The two key recommendations for achieving New Zealand toddlers&#65533; iron needs were, therefore, a recommendation to consume an iron-fortified toddler milk and a recommendation to consume substantial amounts of red meat. 
 In the third stage, the efficacy of an increased intake of red meat or the use of an iron-fortified milk for improving biochemical iron status in healthy non-anaemic 12-20 month old New Zealand children was investigated in a 20-week partial double-blind randomised placebo-controlled intervention trial. The study also examined the effect of these two interventions on dietary iron intakes and growth, and investigated the association between the amount of meat consumed and biochemical iron parameters. Participants (n=225) were assigned to one of three groups: Meat Group (n=90), Fortified Milk Group (n=45), or Placebo Group (n=90). Children in the Meat Group were encouraged to consume two red meat dishes per day (~ 2.6 mg of iron). In the Fortified Milk Group and Placebo Group, the children&#65533;s regular milk was replaced with iron-fortified cow&#65533;s milk (1.5 mg of iron per 100 g of prepared milk), or non-fortified cow&#65533;s milk (&lt; 0.1 mg of iron per 100 g of prepared milk), respectively. Geometric mean dietary iron intakes (95% CI) increased from 4.7 (4.1, 5.3) to 5.3 (4.7, 6.0) mg per day in the Meat Group (P=0.007), and from 4.3 (3.7, 5.0) to 10.4 (9.0, 12.2) mg per day in the Fortified Milk Group (P&lt;0.001). These increased iron intakes differed significantly from the Placebo Group (both P&lt;0.001), which declined from 5.1 (4.5, 5.7) to 4.6 (4.1, 5.2) mg per day during the intervention (P=0.047). Over 20 weeks, adjusted geometric mean serum ferritin concentration increased by 44% (95% CI: 14%, 82%) in the Fortified Milk Group (P=0.002), tended to decrease in the Placebo Group (14% decrease (95% CI: -27%, 1%; P=0.063)), and did not significantly change in the Meat Group (10% increase (95% CI: -7%, 30%; P=0.241)). However, because iron status declined in the Placebo Group, both groups fared significantly better than the Placebo Group: serum ferritin concentration at 20 weeks was 68% (95% CI: 27%, 124%; P&lt;0.001) greater in the Fortified Milk Group than in the Placebo Group, and 29% (95% CI: 2%, 63%; P=0.033) greater in the Meat Group than in the Placebo Group. There were no intervention effects on haemoglobin or serum transferrin receptor concentration. The cross-sectional analysis showed that a daily intake of 1 g of red meat was associated with 0.65% (95% CI: 0.18%, 1.11%; P=0.007) higher serum ferritin concentration. No adverse effects of the interventions on the toddlers&#65533; growth were detected. 
 In conclusion, this thesis shows that food-based strategies can be designed that, if adhered to, should ensure adequate iron status in New Zealand toddlers. Although both the iron-fortified milk recommendation and the increased red meat recommendation are likely to prevent the decline in body iron stores that can occur during the second year of life, only consumption of iron-fortified milk can successfully increase iron stores. Therefore, food-based strategies for New Zealand toddlers will need to include a recommendation that encourages the consumption of foods developed specifically for toddlers that are fortified with iron.</field><field name="date">n/a</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">infants</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">iron in the body</field><field name="subject">iron deficiency diseases in children</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080509.141258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of apoB peptide inhibitors of lipoprotein(a) assembly</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yan-Ting</field><field name="description">High plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Currently, no drugs have proven successful at lowering Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) is comprised of a LDL particle which is covalently bound to an additional glycoprotein, apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. One approach is to develop inhibitors of Lp(a) assembly. It is therefore worth investigating inhibitors for the interaction between apo(a) and apoB-100 for their therapeutic potential to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels. A synthetic &#945;-helical peptide, apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 40 [mu]M). Complexing of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in 1:45 molar ratio increased its inhibitory activity to 4 [mu]M. Since the peptide:DMPC molar ratio previously used in vitro could not be obtained for in vivo study, lower molar ratios of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex were assessed for their inhibitory activities on Lp(a) assembly in vitro and the Lp(a) lowering effect in vivo. A version of the apoB peptide modified to increase stability with DMPC under physiological conditions was also assessed. The aim of this project was to investigate the Lp(a) lowering effect of this peptide-DMPC complex in vivo and to determine its possible mechanism of action. 
 Studies showed that a 1:20 ratio of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex exhibited an effective inhibition of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 9 [mu]M). Intravenous injection of this peptide-DMPC complex (1.3 &#65533; 0.2 mg peptide/mouse) significantly decreased Lp(a) levels at 1, 2 and 4 hours after injection compared with DMPC (p&lt; 0.01). However, a lethal effect occurred in some animals after treatment. This effect is likely associated with the aggregation of the apoB&#8324;&#8323;&#8327;&#8322;&#8331;&#8329;&#8322; peptide-DMPC complex under physiological conditions. 
 In order to develop a more stable peptide, a synthetic peptide, apoB[4365-4396K] based on the apoB4365-4396 sequence and substituted with extra lysines was analyzed and shown to be &#945;-helical in the absence and presence of DMPC. Intrinsic fluorescence studies showed that the apoB[4365-96K] peptide interacted with DMPC under physiological conditions. Also, the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex was shown to form small stable particles by dynamic light scattering. The apoB[4365-96K] peptide proved to be an effective inhibitor of Lp(a) assembly in vitro (IC&#8325;&#8320;= 38 [mu]M). Complexing the apoB[4365-96K] peptide to DMPC increased its inhibitory activity to 16 [mu]M. 
 Intravenous injection of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex decreased the Lp(a) levels at 1 hour and 2 hours after injection compared to DMPC (p&lt; 0.05). The apoB[4365-96K] peptide was present in circulation prominently at 1 hour after intravenous injection and this coincided with a decrease in Lp(a) levels. Neither the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex nor DMPC had a significant effect on Lp(a) levels after intraperitoneal injection. 
 The mechanism by which the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex lowers Lp(a) levels was further investigated. The apoB[4365-96K] peptide was found to associate with plasma lipoproteins through ultrafiltration and agarose gel shift assays. The association of the peptide with lipoproteins was dependent on &#945;-helical structure and enhanced by complexing with DMPC. The association of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide with lipoproteins was also observed in plasma samples from mice treated with the apoB[436S-96K] peptide-DMPC complex intravenously. The association of the peptide-DMPC complex with plasma lipoproteins was most prominent at 1 hour after injection and this coincided with a maximum decrease in Lp(a) levels. These results suggest that the lipoprotein association of the apoB[4365-96K] peptide-DMPC complex played a role in lowering Lp(a) levels in vivo. 
 The work presented in this thesis has shown that apoB peptides containing apoB4372-4392 sequence have inhibitory effect on Lp(a) assembly in vitro and lower Lp(a) levels in vivo. The &#945;-helical structure of the peptide is important for its lipid binding ability and its inhibitory activity on Lp(a) assembly. Furthermore, the association of peptide with lipoproteins appears to play a role in its ability to inhibit Lp(a) assembly in vitro and lower Lp(a) levels in vivo. The studies undertaken in this thesis suggest that altering lipoprotein charges and conformation may reduce the efficiency of Lp(a) assembly. The knowledge gained in this study may provide a basis for future design of inhibitors of Lp(a) assembly.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Lipoprotein A</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080513.112352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening needs of distance learners : a case study of EAP learners at the University of the South Pacific</field><field name="creator">Chand, Rajni Kaushal</field><field name="description">This study focuses on student listening needs in the context of the English for Academic Purposes program taught by distance education at the University of the South Pacific. It explores the relationship between learners&#65533; awareness of the learning strategy they use for developing their listening skills and their teachers&#65533; knowledge of the strategy use and listening needs of learners. 
 Using an ethnographic case study approach, the study was conducted at various campuses and centres of the University of the South Pacific. Interviews were conducted with five EAP/study skills teachers, five subject/course teachers, 19 past learners and 10 present learners of the EAP/study skills course. Questionnaire data was also obtained from 19 past learners and 153 present learners. In addition, a course material analysis was carried out. 
 The study confirms and adds weight to the conclusions of earlier researchers such as Berne (1998), and Mendelsohn (2001) who explain that discrepancies exist between L2 listening research and practice. The findings of this research indicate that teachers differ from their learners in terms of learners&#65533; knowledge and understanding of listening skills and learning strategies in use. The findings also indicate that even though learning had taken place in this distance education context some face-to-face teaching would have been desirable. A combination of distance teaching with longer teacher-learner contact for distance teaching of listening skills is recommended, since regular contact between teachers and learners is seen by learners as very beneficial and more likely to lead to a better development of listening skills. It also helps create an awareness of learners&#65533; present and future listening needs. The nature of distance teaching at the University of the South Pacific, and the challenges faced by both teachers and learners are discussed in this study, and the requirement for further needs analysis in regard to distance EAP courses are noted. 
 The study concludes with recommendations for strategy training for distance learners as well as for raising teacher awareness about the importance of strategy teaching. It is also recommended that similar studies be undertaken in other language skills courses offered by distance at universities like USP such as reading, writing and speaking courses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">study and teaching (Higher)</field><field name="subject">foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">listening</field><field name="subject">distance education</field><field name="subject">Oceania</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080827.114047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tectonic evolution of the Eastern Fiordland Gondwana margin</field><field name="creator">Scott, James Morfey</field><field name="description">Eastern Fiordland is an eroded Carboniferous to Cretaceous arc assemblage juxtaposed against the Western Fiordland Gondwana continental margin along the Grebe Shear Zone. In the Manapouri region, Eastern Fiordland is composed of scattered metasedimentary and plutonic rocks of Carboniferous, Jurassic and Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age. Quantitative P-T estimates on rare paragneiss assemblages, coupled with LA-ICP-MS analyses of metamorphic overgrowths on detrital zircon grains, demonstrate metamorphism at low to middle amphibolite facies (&lt;6 kbar, c. 600&#65533;C) at 145.0 &#65533; 2.8 Ma (all quoted errors at 2[sigma]). The Manapouri-Lake Te Anau area of Eastern Fiordland also exposes scattered fragments of the Mesozoic volcano-sedimentary Loch Burn Formation. Relict sedimentary features within this long-lived Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous unit indicate deposition in a mostly terrestrial or shallow water environment that was fed by debris flows from proximal granitic and volcanic topographic high points. Deposition of the Loch Burn Formation in the Murchison Mountains is bracketed between a 342.3 &#65533; 1.5 Ma basal granite and an intrusive 157.6 &#65533; 1.4 Ma quartz diorite. Metamorphism throughout the unit achieved greenschist and amphibolite facies temperatures (P unconstrained) in the Early Cretaceous (post c. 148 Ma and prior to c. 121 Ma). 
 Although metasedimentary rocks provide insights into the tectonic evolution of Eastern Fiordland, a range of compositionally heterogeneous plutonic rocks dominates the geology. At Lake Manapouri, these comprise four principal associations: (1) the composite Pomona Island Granite (Carboniferous-Permian and Jurassic), (2) the Beehive Diorite (148.6 &#65533; 2.3 Ma), (3) the heterogeneous Hunter Intrusives (Carboniferous, Jurassic and Early Cretaceous) of the Darran/Median Suite and (4) HiSY granitoid dikes of the Separation Point Suite (123.5 &#65533; l.2Ma). The latter suite also occurs in immediately adjacent parts of Western Fiordland, forming the Refrigerator Orthogneiss (120.7 &#65533;1.1 Ma), the Puteketeke Granite (120.9 &#65533; 0.8 Ma) and the West Arm Leucogranite (116.3 &#65533; 1.2 Ma). Geobarometry indicates the Jurassic portions of the Darran/Median Suite were emplaced between 4 - 6 kbar and Western Fiordland Early Cretaceous Separation Point Suite between 5 - 7 kbar. Zircon initial &#65533;&#8311;&#8311;Hf/&#65533;&#8311;&#8310;Hf isotopic ratios suggest that Separation Point Suite magma could be derived from the same Paleozoic - Late Neoproterozoic mantle source as the Jurassic portion of the Hunter Intrusives member of the Darran/Median Suite. However, Early Cretaceous plutons west of the Early Cretaceous active margin (and study area) have significantly more evolved source regions, reflecting the influence of continental Gondwana on lithosphere composition. Initial &#65533;&#8311;&#8311;Hf/&#65533;&#8311;&#8310;Hf ratios from the Loch Burn Formation Carboniferous basal granite zircon are slightly less primitive than either Darran/Median or Separation Point Suite but nowhere near as evolved as similar-aged zircon in the Eastern Fiordland Mt Crescent Paragneiss unit in the Hunter Mountains. 
 The Cambrian/Early Ordovician Russet Paragneiss, which lies just west of the Grebe Mylonite Zone in Western Fiordland and has been intruded by a range of Early Paleozoic to Mesozoic plutons, was metamorphosed at 7.5 &#65533; 1.2 kbar, 633 &#65533; 25&#65533;C at 348.6 &#65533; 12 Ma and exhibits no evidence for Jurassic re-equilibration. Zircon U-Pb isotopes from a pelitic schist enclave within the Western Fiordland Mt Murrell Amphibolite are interpreted to show that these and associated intrusive rocks were also metamorphosed at kyanite-grade in the Carboniferous. This event, &#65533;M1&#65533;, generated a pervasive lineation and distinctive pargasite-anorthite-kyanite/corundum-bearing assemblages in layered aluminous components to the Mt Murrell Amphibolite, garnet-amphibole-biotite-kyanite-gedrite-plagioclase-quartz in metasomatised tonalite at the Mt Murrell Amphibolite margins, and low CaO-garnet in pelitic schist enclaves within the amphibolite. P-T estimates suggest M1 took place at 6.6 &#65533; 0.8 kbar, 618 &#65533; 25&#65533;C. Both the timing and P-T conditions of M1 overlap with metamorphism of the Russet Paragneiss. However, the layered amphibolites and pelitic schist enclaves partially re-equilibrated in the Early Cretaceous (c. 115 Ma) at higher pressure (8.8 &#65533; 0.9 kbar). This event, &#65533;M2&#65533;, generated static assemblages of margarite, epidote, chlorite, oligoclase-andesine and second-generation kyanite in the layered amphibolites and relict olivine gabbronorite, and high-CaO garnet rims, biotite, plagioclase, quartz, kyanite and staurolite in the pelitic schist enclaves. Trace element chemistries of c. 340 Ma zircon grains in the schist have unusual smoothed Ce/Ce* anomalies and high Th/U ratios. These properties may be result of fluid flow and metasomatism from the enveloping amphibolite during imposition of the penetrative M1 lineation. Early Cretaceous (c. 115 Ma) zircon overgrowths and chemistries (low heavy rare earth elements, low Th/U ratios, large Eu/Eu* anomalies) are compatible with formation in the presence of local M2 garnet and plagioclase. M2 was coeval with amphibolite to garnet-granulite facies metamorphism of the regionally extensive Western Fiordland Orthogneiss and Arthur River Complex, thus demonstrating that high-pressure metamorphism was not restricted to the Western Fiordland Early Cretaceous components and their marginal metasedimentary rocks. 
 The Grebe Mylonite Zone forms a lithologic, metamorphic, isotopic and structural boundary between Eastern and Western Fiordland. This 200 to 300 metre-wide and &gt; 50 km long north-striking mylonitic zone is the prominent manifestation of deformation associated with the wider (c. 30 km) Grebe Shear Zone, which extends into Eastern and Western Fiordland. Qualitative and quantitative P-T estimates indicate the currently exposed level of the Grebe Mylonite Zone was active at amphibolite facies conditions (c. 600&#65533;C and c. 6 kbar). Coupled U-Pb and Ar-Ar data indicate the mylonite zone was active at, or between, c. 128 and 116 Ma. Temperature-time profiles constructed along a transect perpendicular to the shear zone, used in conjunction with fabric data and the orientation of nearby Tertiary unconformities, suggest that the currently sub-vertical shear zone was rotated during the Cenozoic from an initially steeply east-dipping geometry with a reverse sense of shear. This style of deformation is consistent with an inclined continuously partitioned transpressional structure. Synkinematic emplacement and deformation of the Refrigerator Orthogneiss implies that Grebe Shear Zone provided a crustal anisotropy that facilitated the movement and emplacement of some Separation Point Suite magmas through the crust. 
 Data collected here are interpreted to show that the Grebe Shear Zone is a terrane-bounding suture. Differences in metasedimentary rock composition, age, provenance and metamorphism across the zone suggest that the crustal framework to Eastern Fiordland did not forth in its current tectonic position. Instead, the Mesozoic portion of Eastern Fiordland is inferred to have developed allochthonously with respect to Western Fiordland, with components internally dismembered and rearranged during Jurassic metamorphism and juxtaposition in the Early Cretaceous. However, the Jurassic portion of the arc may have developed near the Gondwana margin because the Jurassic Borland Paragneiss contains detritus that can be partly matched to sources in the Western and Eastern Provinces of New Zealand, as well as early parts of the Darran/Median Suite and Loch Burn Formation. Recognition that the Eastern Fiordland arc was faulted against and then over Western Fiordland in the Early Cretaceous provides a possible driving mechanism for coeval transpressive shortening, rapid burial and high-pressure metamorphism (e.g., as seen in the Mt Murrell Amphibolite) of the lower Western Fiordland crust.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphotectonics</field><field name="subject">Fiordland</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081003.094325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative life-history strategies in the trematode Coitocaecum parvum (Opecoelidae) : effects of environmental factors and within-host competition</field><field name="creator">Lagrue, Clement</field><field name="description">From simple beginnings, when only one host was required, numerous parasitic organisms have evolved complex life-cycles involving two or more host species. For example, trematode parasites reproduce in vertebrates, their definitive host, but their current life cycle also typically involves two intermediate hosts that were added during the course of evolution. Vertebrates are often considered to be the ancestral hosts of trematodes although other scenarios exist. While multi-host life cycles are observed in distantly related groups of parasites, their evolution remains largely unexplored. 
 In trematodes, while recent phylogenetic studies have shed light on the sequence along which the different hosts were incorporated in the cycle, conditions that favoured the evolution of such complex life cycles can only be hypothesized. However, one opportunity to understand the force shaping the evolution of complex life cycles is provided by the few trematode species in which the classical three-host cycle facultatively reverts to a shorter cycle (i.e. life cycle abbreviation). In this study, the effects of different environmental factors on the life history strategy of the trematode Coitocaecum parvum were investigated using laboratory and field studies. C. parvum is able to abbreviate its life cycle from three to two hosts by maturing early (i.e. progenesis) and producing eggs inside the second intermediate host; both life history strategies occur simultaneously in C. parvum populations. 
 Environmental factors such as predator densities should strongly influence parasite life history strategies. In fact, this study shows that laboratory reared Coitocaecum parvum adopt preferentially the normal three-host cycle when chemical cues from the definitive host are added to their environment, while the shorter cycle is favoured when these cues are absent. However, in nature, multiple environmental factors are likely to be perceived by parasites. Consequently, C. parvum&#65533;s ability to adapt its developmental strategy to definitive host densities may be confounded by the complex combination of various environmental parameters. 
 Within-host competition between parasites sharing a common host is also likely to influence individual life history strategies. Parasites could then use alternative life strategies to adaptively respond to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Indeed, this study found that C. parvum preferentially adopts the abbreviated cycle in the presence of competitors. However, in interspecific competition, C. parvum&#65533;s strategy also depends upon the competitor species, possibly influenced by the other species&#65533; transmission route. Furthermore, intensity of intraspecific competition proved to constrain C. parvum&#65533;s ability to use the abbreviated life cycle. Finally, genetic relatedness between co-infecting C. parvum individuals seems to affect parasite life strategy through kin selection: closely related individuals are more likely to adopt the same developmental strategy, when they share a host, than unrelated ones. 
 C. parvum individuals adopting the abbreviated cycle are enclosed within a cyst in their intermediate host and must produce eggs by self-fertilization, the most severe case of inbreeding. It was hypothesized that their offspring would have reduced fitness due to inbreeding depression, therefore selecting against the shorter cycle. However, this study found no difference in the survival and infection success of offspring produced through the abbreviated and normal cycles. Furthermore, no evidence for a genetic basis of life cycle abbreviation was detected: the same proportion of offspring from both reproductive strategies adopted the shorter life cycle. 
 The work in this thesis provides evidence that although life cycle abbreviation provides Coitocaecum parvum with a viable alternative life strategy, numerous factors promote or restrict the adoption of this strategy. While this life history strategy has no detectable effect on parasite fitness, both environmental parameters and within-host competition affect C. parvum life-history strategies, alternatively selecting for either the shorter or normal life cycle. Overall, the complexity of the parasite environment could maintain both developmental strategies in C. parvum populations and, on a broader scale, could have influenced the evolution of complex life cycles in parasites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trematoda</field><field name="subject">life cycles</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">host-parasite relationships</field><field name="subject">Coitocaecum parvum</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20080905.111744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different ways of knowing? : understanding disabled students&#65533; and teacher aides&#65533; school experiences within a context of relational social justice</field><field name="creator">Rutherford, Gill</field><field name="description">Disabled students&#65533; experiences of working with teacher aides constitute a recent focus of international inquiry. To date in New Zealand, there has been no specific investigation of this aspect of education, despite the widespread reliance on teacher aide support as the primary means of responding to disabled students&#65533; presence in schools. Similarly, there are very few New Zealand studies in which teacher aides are the primary participants. This thesis seeks to address this absence in New Zealand educational research by exploring students&#65533; and teacher aides&#65533; experiences of working together, in order to understand the impact of assigning responsibility for students who have complex learning support requirements to teacher aides who require no qualification, training, or experience to work in this role. 
 This interpretive qualitative study is positioned in a multi-dimensional framework of current disability, social justice, and sociology of childhood theorising. A series of semi-structured meetings were held with ten students, aged eight to seventeen years, who attended schools in the South Island of New Zealand. As well, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen teacher aides who worked in a range of primary, intermediate, and secondary schools in the same geographic area as the student participants. Data were interpreted utilizing both inductive and deductive means of analysis. 
 Students&#65533; participation in the research and their contributions to the findings demonstrated their competence, agency, and heterogeneity. Students conveyed a sense of the importance and value of the teacher aide&#65533;s role, if clearly defined and carried out in a positive, professional manner within the context of supportive schools. The findings relating to teacher aides&#65533; experiences highlighted the diverse, ambiguous nature of their roles, conceptualised as a continuum of support ranging from aiding teachers in inclusive contexts, to aiding students in assimilationist circumstances, to assuming the role of teacher or babysitter for students in exclusive educational environments. Analysis of teacher aides&#65533; experiences revealed the fundamental importance of relationships in coming to know students in terms of their humanness and competence, and in underpinning teacher aides&#65533; efforts to do the right thing by students. Participants also identified the need for all adults involved in the policy and practice of education to develop shared understandings of respectful, socially just ways of thinking about disability and childhood as the foundation of a common commitment to teach all students well. 
 The insight generated by participants, who represent perhaps the least powerful of students and employees in New Zealand schools, illuminates some of the most significant changes that need to occur in the thinking and practices of people involved in educational policy-making, teacher and teacher aide education, and schools. Addressing these educational deficits may contribute to the development of a socially just education system that is respectful of and responsive to human difference while recognising and respecting our mutual humanness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teachers' assistants</field><field name="subject">students with disabilities</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">social justice</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081125.160830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and comparison of osseointegration in conventionally and immediately restored titanium implants in a sheep model</field><field name="creator">Fitzgibbon, Daniel Nathan</field><field name="description">Objectives: The present work was under taken to compare osseointegration of immediately and delayed restored implants in a sheep model, and to compare methods of assessing osseointegration. 
 Methods: Twenty wide-platform implants were placed in the posterior mandibles of 10 sheep, 3 months after premolar extractions. Ten were control implants placed and restored after 3 months of submerged healing. Ten were test implants placed contralaterally and immediately restored. Animals were sacrificed after a further 3 months of healing. At each experimental stage implant stability was measured with resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and standardized radiographs were taken. Tissue blocks with the implants were embedded in acrylic resin. The specimens were analysed by three-dimensional micro tomogram (micro-CT) images. Ground sections of the tissue blocks were then prepared for light microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Morphometric parameters computed by both methods were mean percent bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and mean percent bone density (BD). Radiographic, stability and morphometric measurements were compared statistically. 
 Results: The survival rate was 60% (controls) versus 40% (test) (p=0.28). Mean crestal bone levels after three months restoration did not differ significantly between control (5.54 &#65533; 0.92) and test groups (4.35 &#65533; 1.61) (p=0.56). All surviving implants were stable at stage three and RFA values in implant stability quotient (ISQ) did not differ significantly between the two groups (test 82.3 &#65533; 3.9 versus control 78.8 &#65533; 4.3, p=0.36). No correlation was found between crestal bone loss and RFA (Spearman&#65533;s rho =-0.27, p=0.46). Histomorphometric analysis found no statistical difference (%BIC test 65.65 &#65533; 12.7%, control 53.36 &#65533; 6.41%, p=0.18; and %BD test 54.84 &#65533; 8.45%, control 64.69 &#65533; 13.57%, p=0.11). A similar trend was observed for mean micro-CT (%BIC test 65.72 &#65533; 72, control 50.84 &#65533; 4.19, p=0.11). Histology revealed high density inflammatory infiltrates beneath the sulcular and pocket epithelium. No significant difference was found between histomorphometric (HMA) and microCT analysis (%BIC p=0.08, %BD p=0.08). A statistically significant correlation was observed between HMA and microCT for %BIC (Spearman&#65533;s rho = 0.89, p=0.02) but not %BD (Spearman&#65533;s rho = 0.51, p=0.30). 
 Conclusions: The results suggest that the sheep mandibular model has limited potential for evaluation of implants designed for poor quality bone and for the assessment of implant loading protocols. This thesis does highlight the potential for the use of this model in peri-implantitis studies. The results suggest that morphometric variables determined by HMA and microCT analysis are comparable, however further studies are required to standardize the microCT protocol to reduce metal artifacts and enhance bone-implant contrast.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osseointegrated dental implants</field><field name="subject">osseointegration</field><field name="subject">titanium</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20081201.161832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ageing and emotion : categorisation, recognition, and social understanding</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Melissa-Sue</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigated age differences in emotion recognition skills of 146 older adults (age range 60-92 years) and 146 young adults (age range 18-25 years) in four experiments. Experiment 1 assessed participants&#65533; ability to categorise facial expressions of sadness, fear, happiness, and surprise. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants were asked to identify six emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, disgust) from still and dynamic faces, alone and in combination with vocal expressions. Finally, Experiment 4 compared performance on these standard emotion recognition paradigms to that of more ecologically-valid measures; the Faux Pas and Verbosity and Social Cues Tasks. 
 Across the four studies, there was evidence of an age-related decline in emotion recognition skills. Older adults were overall less sensitive to perceptual differences between faces in Experiment 1 and showed a loss of categorical perception effect for fearful faces. Older adults were less accurate than young adults at recognising expressions of sadness, anger, and fear, across types of expression (voices and faces). There were some differences across modalities, with older adults showing difficulties with fear recognition for faces, but not voices, and difficulty in matching happy voices to happy faces but not for happy voices and faces presented in isolation. Experiment 2 also showed that the majority of older adult participants had some decline in emotion recognition skills. 
 Age differences in performance were also apparent on the more ecologically-valid measures. Older adults were more likely than young adults to rate the protagonist as behaving inappropriately in the Faux Pas Task, even with the control videos, suggesting difficulty in discriminating faux pas. Older adults were also judged to be more verbose and to offer more off-topic information during the Verbosity Task than young adults and were less likely to recognise expressions of boredom in the Social Cues Task. 
 These findings are discussed in terms of three theoretical accounts. A positivity bias (indicating increased recognition and experience of positive emotions and reduction for negative emotions) was not consistent with the older adults&#65533; difficulties with matching happy faces to voices and relatively preserved performance with disgusted expressions. Age-related decline in cognitive processes did not account for the specific pattern of age differences observed. The most plausible explanation for the age differences in the present thesis is that age-related neurological changes in the brain areas that process emotions, specifically the temporal and frontal areas, are likely to contribute to the older adults&#65533; declines in performance on emotion categorisation, emotion recognition, and social cognition tasks. The implications for everyday social interactions for older adults are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">emotions and cognition</field><field name="subject">recognition (psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090309.150008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theta activations associated with goal-conflict processing : evidence for the revised "behavioral inhibition system"</field><field name="creator">Neo, Phoebe Suat-Hong</field><field name="description">In the theory of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), Gray and McNaughton (2000) classified events that produce or inhibit goal-directed behaviour into two affective categories: approach versus avoidance. We experience goal-conflict when approximately equal but incompatible approach and avoidance tendencies are concurrently activated. Gray and McNaughton (2000) proposed goal-conflict as a class of mechanisms separable from "simple" mechanisms: Goal-conflict effects are maximal when incompatible approach and avoidance tendencies are balanced, simple effects are maximal when either approach or avoidance tendencies predominate. 
 Gray and McNaughton (2000) saw the hippocampus as a key nexus for resolving goal conflict by recursive amplification of the subjective value of punishment, thereby increasing avoidance tendencies. Rodent hippocampal theta (4-12 Hz) is necessary (but not sufficient) for correct and efficient transmission of hipppocampal outputs. The BIS theory is fundamentally an animal model. It is not clear if a human BIS exists in the same form. Record human hippocampal (4-12 Hz) activity from the scalp is unlikely. However, during goal-conflict resolution, cortically generated theta recorded from the scalp could be modulated by human hippocampal theta. Therefore, superficially recorded 4-12 Hz theta spectra power was used to assess if specific goal-conflict processing activity could be detected in humans. 
 Human goal-conflict processing was assessed in four experiments: the Stop-Signal Task (SST), an existing experimental task, and three variations of a task termed "Choice", created for this thesis. Across experiments, three key conditions were created. Approach and avoidance were balanced in the intermediate condition (maximal goal-conflict). Net approach and avoidance predominated in the adjacent conditions respectively (minimal goal-conflict). Goal-conflict was assessed as the difference between activity in the intermediate condition and the average activity across the adjacent conditions (via extraction of the orthogonal quadratic trend for significance testing). 
 Goal-conflict increased activations consistently at F8, above the right frontal cortex. Increase in task dependent goal-conflict activations were also observed at F7, Fz and F4 above the frontal cortex, and T3, T4, T5 and T6 above the temporal cortex. Activations within the human theta frequency range (4-7 Hz) were consistently detected in the Choice tasks. In the SST, activations spanned the conventional human theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies. In the Choice tasks, higher conflict theta at T3, T5 and F8 predicted increased avoidance. 
 Taken together, the findings support Gray and McNaugthon&#65533;s (2000) views that a) goal-conflict is a class of mechanism separable from simple approach and avoidance; b) goal-conflict processing recruits and increases cortical rhythmic activity within the same frequency range as rodent hippocampal theta (4-12 Hz); and goal-conflict is resolved by increasing the subjective value of punishment, thereby increasing avoidance tendencies. Although speculative, the current work identified a right inferior frontal gyrus neural circuit for slower, and a presupplementary motor area circuit for faster behavioral inhibition during goal-conflict resolution. These circuits are not explicit in the current BIS model.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goal (psychology)</field><field name="subject">theta rhythm</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090309.160549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An injury surveillance framework for the New Zealand construction industry</field><field name="creator">McCracken, Selwyn</field><field name="description">Background: The burden of fatal and non-fatal injury for the New Zealand construction industry is larger than most other industrial sectors. Injury preventions efforts for construction have however been hampered because of insufficient, industry-specific, surveillance data that is essential for the effective targeting and evaluation of interventions. 
 Aim: This thesis aimed to describe and test a feasible framework of Injury Surveillance for the New Zealand construction industry. Accordingly, the specific objectives to accomplish this aim were: To identify an optimal surveillance dataset for New Zealand construction injuries; To assess potential sources of data and collection methods; To describe an ideal study design for undertaking injury surveillance; To implement an operational design based on industry stakeholder input; To undertake and evaluate an injury surveillance trial; and To suggest how a viable surveillance system could be permanently established. 
 Method: A trial injury surveillance system was developed by identifying known construction injury risk factors from the literature, reviewing the data collection practices of the New Zealand industry and other potential data sources and consulting with industry stakeholders about the most feasible collection methodology. This surveillance framework was then tested by combining national data from routine Government sources and data from 3 construction companies that employed approximately 720 workers between them. National construction injury data was obtained from the Accident Compensation Corporation, the Department of Labour and the Injury Information Manager. The trial Surveillance System was then evaluated in terms of its ability to collect the full range of an optimal dataset, the quality and completeness of information actually collected, the ability to identify and monitor injury priorities for the industry, and the future viability and acceptability of this surveillance design to the industry. 
 Results: A total of 468 medically treated injuries were recorded by the participating companies, with 15 (3.2%) considered to be Serious Harm injuries as defined by the Health and Safety in Employment Act. The level of data completeness across companies was especially low, with on average 18 out of 34 data fields (53%) completely unrecorded. The data from one company was sufficiently complete (i.e. 63% across all fields) to allow individual risk factor analyses to be conducted, whereas the absence of complete denominator data prevented the completion of the same analyses for the other two companies. Viewed overall, Government agency data was sufficiently detailed to estimate national longitudinal trends, injury agency and mechanism priorities for specific occupations and industry subsectors, and allowed a rudimentary evaluation of a national intervention programme. However, questions about data accuracy, completeness and under-reporting were raised for each of the Government data sources used. 
 Conclusions: Using data entirely from Government sources appears to be the most immediately viable framework of Injury Surveillance for the New Zealand construction industry. As such, the relevant range of analyses demonstrated by this study should be continued, expanded and improved. In contrast, obtaining injury surveillance data from companies in the manner that was tested does not appear to feasible, given the difficulty in recruiting companies and the poor data completeness of those companies that did participate. However, the increased range of prevention targets identified by the company that did largely contribute data as intended, demonstrated that company surveillance had merit relative to existing procedures. Suggested steps toward implementing viable construction injury surveillance within New Zealand are outlined, including a recommendation to the industry&#65533;s Health and Safety organisation, SiteSafe, to investigate the most feasible data collection protocol for its members.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial safety</field><field name="subject">industrial accidents</field><field name="subject">construction industry</field><field name="subject">safety measures</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090501.140407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental-state and emotion understanding across childhood : individual differences and relations with social competence</field><field name="creator">Martin, Natasha</field><field name="description">Mental-state and emotion understanding are important constructs for successful interpretation of behaviour and interaction with others. While false-belief understanding has been the main focus of investigations into children&#65533;s mentalising over the past 30 years, we now have tasks available that allow assessment of a broader range and more advanced set of mentalising skills amongst older age groups of typically developing young people (Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, &amp; Robertson, 1997a; Baron-Cohen, O&#65533;Riordan, Stone, Jones, &amp; Plaisted, 1999; Happe&#769;, 1994). A recent trend has seen a shift away from investigating when children attain these skills towards examining individual differences in their performance. This has included consideration of both the factors that contribute to (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001; Hughes &amp; Dunn, 1997; Meins et al., 2002; Milligan, Astington, &amp; Dack, 2007; Ruffman, Slade, &amp; Crowe, 2002), and the factors that are influenced by (Astington &amp; Jenkins, 2000; Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, Zubernis, &amp; Balaraman, 2003; Diesendruck &amp; Ben-Eliyahu, Repacholi, Slaughter, Pritchard, &amp; Gibbs, 2003) individual differences in mental-state understanding. One of the interesting questions in this area is what are the subsequent benefits or harm that individual differences in mentalising and emotion skills hold for children&#65533;s social competence? 
 The current study investigates young people&#65533;s growing socioemotional understanding and how it is related to their social abilities, both prosocial and antisocial. The aims were to provide information on the relations amongst advanced mental-state skills, to investigate how these skills were related to emotion understanding, and, further, to investigate how socioemotional skills were related to social competence. The current study also extended the literature by addressing these aims amongst older children. Two studies were conducted, involving children (4- to 7-years) seen on four occasions in a three-year longitudinal study, and adolescents (13- to 17-years) in a cross-sectional study. There were a number of key findings. Individual differences in children&#65533;s advanced mental-state understanding are relatively stable across time, and the relations which they show with emotion skills are more consistent when examining tasks that shared skill sets. Language plays an important mediating role in the relation between socioemotional skills, although this influence appears to decrease with age. Mental-state and emotion understanding are both important for children and adolescents&#65533; social competence. It seems that greater socioemotional abilities influence prosocial behaviours, and poorer socioemotional abilities influence antisocial behaviours. Overall, the current study provides evidence that socioemotional skills are overlapping but distinct constructs, that they show varied interactions in social settings, and that future investigations of how children come to understand and interact with others will be best served by careful consideration of appropriate measures and by including multiple aspects of children&#65533;s social cognition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child psychology</field><field name="subject">child development</field><field name="subject">face perception</field><field name="subject">emotions in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in children</field><field name="subject">social skills in adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090506.104410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Knowing' sustainable development in the business arena</field><field name="creator">Byrch, Christine</field><field name="description">A growing knowledge of the human impact on the environment has led to widespread dissatisfaction with the current relationship between industrial societies and the nature that sustains them. From within this milieu, sustainable development has emerged as a term that describes an appropriate relationship in the context of the present time and culture. Although it has been widely adopted by many individuals and organisations, there is little agreement as to what it means and entails. 
 Business has been attributed a significant role in achieving sustainable development. Many have joined the sustainable development debate and received both accolades and critique for their endeavours to interpret and implement the concept within the business sector. Consideration of the prominent and influential role of business in industrial societies, and the lack of definition, elicits the question: what do those people who have taken up the challenge of applying the principles of sustainable development to the business sector think the term means? 
 In response, I have explored participants&#65533; subjective knowledge of the meaning of sustainable development within the broad context of humanity&#65533;s relationship with nature. In this context, sustainable development is just one of many views of the &#65533;proper&#65533; relationship incumbent within environmentalism, and which variously critique industrial society&#65533;s relationship with nature. A cognitive approach was adopted that suggests how a society views and uses nature arises from its culture; and that an individual&#65533;s vision of nature is influenced by their personal environmental worldview, encompassing fundamental beliefs regarding the underlying nature of reality and guidelines for living. 
 The views of forty-eight individuals active in New Zealand&#65533;s &#65533;sustainable business arena&#65533; were investigated. Participants were drawn from businesses purported to be adopting the principles of sustainable development and organisations assisting in this endeavour. Their knowledge was explored by means of cognitive mapping, semi structured questioning, and Q Methodology. 
 Not surprisingly, participants held a variety of normative and subjective understandings of sustainable development that appear to have arisen from &#65533;life in general&#65533; rather than any external source. Although humanity, the environment, and change were considered central to sustainable development, beyond this were contested notions and priorities as each participant described their vision for the future, each challenging various aspects of our industrial society, to varying degrees. Five ideal-type views were characterised and termed the Societalist, Individualist, Ecologist, Realist, and Futurist views. The five ideal-type views are presented as a typology, constructed from relevant and prioritised worldview beliefs, that highlights the major contradictions. Considered in this way, consensus on the meaning of sustainable development seems unlikely. And perhaps sustainable development is not one thing but instead a reflexive culture of change such that we question how we live. 
 Hitherto, extant sustainable development literature has highlighted the power of business over society. In contrast, in this research, participants reported their attempts to implement sustainable development within business were constrained by society&#65533;s requirements and institutions. Further, understanding of sustainable development was observed to be learnt from our culture, highlighting at a more fundamental level, the sway of society on sustainable business.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090615.101310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conceptual framework : the views of natural shareholders in Australia</field><field name="creator">Myers, Paul James</field><field name="description">An enquiry into the relevance and reliability of accounting information that is provided to natural shareholders in Australia.

This in turn increases the performance envelope of the race car. However the extra downforce increases aerodynamic drag which (apart from when braking) is generally detrimental to lap-times. The drag acts to slow the vehicle, and hinders the effect of available drive power and reduces fuel economy. Wings, in automotive use, are not constrained by the same parameters as aircraft, and thus higher angles of attack can be safely reached, although at a higher cost in drag. Variable geometry aerodynamic devices have been used in many forms of motorsport in the past offering the ability to change the relative values of downforce and drag. These have invariably been banned, generally due to safety reasons. The use of active aerodynamics is currently legal in both Formula SAE (engineering compet ition for university students to design, build and race an open-wheel race car) and production vehicles. A number of passenger car companies are beginning to incorporate active aerodynamic devices in their designs.    In this research the effect of ground proximity on the lift, drag and moment coefficients of inverted, two-dimensional aerofoils was investigated. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect ground proximity on aerofoils post stall, in an effort to evaluate the use of active aerodynamics to increase the performance of a race car. The aerofoils were tested at angles of attack ranging from 0&#176; - 135&#176;. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 2.16 x 105 based on chord length. Forces were calculated via the use of pressure taps along the centreline of the aerofoils. The RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel (IWT) was used for the testing. Normally 3m wide and 2m high, an extra contraction was installed and the section was reduced to form a width of 295mm. The wing was mounted between walls to simulate 2-D flow. The IWT was chosen as it would allow enough height to reduce blockage effect caused by the aerofoils when at high angles of incidence. The walls of the tunnel were pressure tapped to allow monitoring  of the pressure gradient along the tunnel. The results show a delay in the stall of the aerofoils tested with reduced ground clearance. Two of the aerofoils tested showed a decrease in Cl with decreasing ground clearance; the third showed an increase. The Cd of the aerofoils post-stall decreased with reduced ground clearance. Decreasing ground clearance was found to reduce pitch moment variation of the aerofoils with varied angle of attack. The results were used in a simulation of a typical Formula SAE race car.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerofoil</field><field name="subject">Ground effect</field><field name="subject">high angle of attack</field><field name="subject">active aerodynamics</field><field name="subject">Formula SAE</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080110.145138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interoperability and information system replacement in the health sector</field><field name="creator">Pusatli, Ozgur Tolga</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information system replacement</field><field name="subject">SNOMED</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">interoperability</field><field name="subject">Australian health sector</field><field name="subject">LOINC</field><field name="subject">HL7</field><field name="subject">category theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variations of classical extremal graph theoretical problems: Moore bound and connectivity</field><field name="creator">Tang, Jianmin</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">graph theory</field><field name="subject">integrated technology</field><field name="subject">topology</field><field name="subject">digraphs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 3He(d,p)4He nuclear fusion reaction as a source of mega-voltage protons for the production of fluorine-18 for PET applications</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Michael</field><field name="description">Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (Physics)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">positron emission tomography</field><field name="subject">nuclear fusion</field><field name="subject">fluoro deoxyglucose</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Swearing: impact on nurses and implications for therapeutic practice</field><field name="creator">Stone, Teresa Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">swearing</field><field name="subject">verbal aggression</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">therapeutic interaction</field><field name="subject">boundaries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Are schools ready to go online?"

There is only limited published research on the topic, either at an academic or industry level. The New Zealand Government has been conducting work in identity fraud in recent times but New Zealand appears to be lagging behind other similar westernised countries in terms of developing specific identity fraud policy or legislative provisions. The research showed that New Zealand does have serious problems in its systems, which in some cases facilitate identity fraud. There is a lack of synchronicity between New Zealand Government systems which undermines a whole of government approach to minimising the risk of identity fraud. Issues in the private sector with identity fraud are just as serious, with financial advantage being one of the main reasons that identity fraud is committed. However, the lack of information sharing between the public and private sectors does not help stem the flow of identity fraud that is currently occurring. Finding policy solutions to combat identity fraud is far from being simplistic. Public policy in this area is fraught with social, political and financial implications. Identity fraud is committed with speed while public policy faces a slow battle with red tape. Nonetheless, the New Zealand Government does not even appear to categorically know what is happening on its own door step with respect to identity fraud. There are no statistics on identity fraud and no concrete figures as to the cost of identity fraud to New Zealand. To compound problems, identity fraud is not even an official offence classification so even when it is occurring, it is not always being recorded. The damage resulting from identity fraud can be catastrophic. Identity fraud is a breeder crime for other offences. It can enable an act of terrorism to occur, women and children to be trafficked, and organisations and individuals to suffer serious financial loss. In New Zealand however, the benefits of identity fraud can be great while the deterrents are weak. New Zealand faces potential harm to its international reputation if its systems are not strengthened to fight identity fraud. In order for this to occur, New Zealand needs to develop a specific identity fraud policy so that it has the basic knowledge in place to allocate the necessary resources to this problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Identity fraud</field><field name="subject">Identity crime</field><field name="subject">Identity documents</field><field name="subject">Systems analysis</field><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of accounting and accountants: an investigation into how and why these perceptions were formed</field><field name="creator">Wells, Paul K.</field><field name="description">There is growing concern that a widespread perception of accounting and accountants is discouraging individuals with the required skills and capabilities from entering the accounting profession. At the same time, an inappropriate perception may be attracting those who lack the required skills and capabilities. Research suggests that not only are perceptions of accounting and accountants very negative but that they may also be inaccurate and difficult to change. This thesis applies social psychology theory on stereotyping to assist in identifying why these perceptions are resistant to change. Stereotype theory suggests that strategies for changing perceptions are dependent on how and why the perceptions were formed. Through a questionnaire, this study sought to identify the perceptions and through interviews and focus groups, how and why they were formed. A questionnaire, interviews and focus groups were used to collect data from sixty-five people from four distinct groups. These groups included the general public, users of accounting services, young people making career decisions, and accountants themselves. Additional data was collected from a further three accounting educators. The application of stereotype theory has assisted in explaining why common perceptions of accounting and accountants have been so resistant to change and in identifying suitable intervention strategies. This study found that the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are inaccurate. They are either too specific and hence unnecessarily restrictive and limiting, or alternatively the perceptions are so abstract and lacking in specificity that they are absorbed into a broader level category. In the first instance, a single experience is overgeneralised to represent a participant&#8223;s understanding of accounting. In the second instance, accounting is overgeneralised to represent all activity of the broader category label. That the accounting profession, in general, has appeared to make little effort to correct these inaccurate perceptions and has failed to disseminate more widely the findings from academic research is of concern. Overgeneralised perceptions of accounting and accountants were found to be resistant to change for a number of reasons. Participants who created a very broad category label to represent their abstract understanding of accounting usually lacked the motivation and/or cognitive capacity to add specificity to their understanding. On the other hand, participants who based their perceptions of accounting on single exemplar models lacked an understanding of the skills and capabilities that accountants possessed and how these competencies could serve them. The influence of the high school curriculum was a further reason that perceptions were resistant to change. When members of the wider community had studied accounting at high school, their understanding of accounting was narrowly focused on the scorekeeping role of accounting. The perceptions of people who had studied accounting at high school, both currently and in the past, were the most resistant to change. The following interventions to change the perceptions people have of accounting and accountants are proposed. First it is necessary for the professional associations to articulate clearly the advice from the academic community on how the role of accountants and the nature of accounting have changed and to increase the awareness of these changes among their members. It is then necessary to communicate this information to the public by aligning the diverse range of accounting outputs with individual goals while explaining how accountants&#8223; training has changed to accommodate these more diverse roles. Finally, it is necessary to reconsider how accounting should be taught at high school, providing less emphasis on the scorekeeping role of accountants and increasing the emphasis on how accounting impacts everyday life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Perceptions</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes</field><field name="subject">Accounting</field><field name="subject">Accountants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-Time Multi-Sensor Localisation and Mapping Algorithms for Mobile Robots</field><field name="creator">Matsumoto, Takeshi</field><field name="description">A mobile robot system provides a grounded platform for a wide variety of interactive systems to be developed and deployed. The mobility provided by the robot presents unique challenges as it must observe the state of the surroundings while observing the state of itself with respect to the environment. The scope of the discipline includes the mechanical and hardware issues, which limit and direct the capabilities of the software considerations. The systems that are integrated into the mobile robot platform include both specific task oriented and fundamental modules that define the core behaviour of the robot. While the earlier can sometimes be developed separately and integrated at a later stage, the core modules are often custom designed early on to suit the individual robot system depending on the configuration of the mechanical components.
This thesis covers the issues encountered and the resolutions that were implemented during the development of a low cost mobile robot platform using off the shelf sensors, with a particular focus on the algorithmic side of the system. The incrementally developed modules target the localisation and mapping aspects by incorporating a number of different sensors to gather the information of the surroundings from different perspectives by simultaneously or sequentially combining the measurements to disambiguate and support each other. Although there is a heavy focus on the image processing techniques, the integration with the other sensors and the characteristics of the platform itself are included in the designs and analyses of the core and interactive modules.
A visual odometry technique is implemented for the localisation module, which includes calibration processes, feature tracking, synchronisation between multiple sensors, as well as short and long term landmark identification to calculate the relative pose of the robot in real time. The mapping module considers the interpretation and the representation of sensor readings to simplify and hasten the interactions between multiple sensors, while selecting the appropriate attributes and characteristics to construct a multi-attributed model of the environment.
The modules that are developed are applied to realistic indoor scenarios, which are taken into consideration in some of the algorithms to enhance the performance through known constraints. As the performance of algorithms depends significantly on the hardware, the environment, and the number of concurrently running sensors and modules, comparisons are made against various implementations that have been developed throughout the project.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile Robot</field><field name="subject">Localisation</field><field name="subject">Mapping</field><field name="subject">Sensor fusion</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100302.131127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Field based testing protocols to monitor training adaptations and performance in elite rowers.</field><field name="creator">Vogler, Andrew James</field><field name="description">Laboratory-based rowing tests are the established standard for assessing fitness traits among elite rowers, and for prescribing individualised exercise intensities for training. But because tests occur on a rowing ergometer, the specificity of laboratory testing has been questioned compared with the criterion of on-water rowing. This project validated equipment required to replicate a laboratory-based rowing test in the field and evaluated the feasibility of on-water tests. Ergometer and on-water test results were compared to assess the validity of ergometer-derived training prescriptions and to establish the effectiveness of on-water tests for monitoring longitudinal fitness changes and for predicting rowing performance.

Concept2 rowing ergometers (Morrisville, USA) have frequently been used for rowing tests. Although subtle design variations exist between the different models of Concept2 ergometer, there were no substantial differences between the results from incremental rowing tests using Model C and Model D ergometers. The Concept2 Model D was therefore accepted as the standard ergometer for subsequent laboratory tests. Typical error (TE) results from duplicate Concept2 Model D tests conducted 2-4 d apart showed that laboratory tests were highly reliable (TE: maximal power = 2.8%, peak oxygen consumption = 2.5%).

As oxygen consumption (VO2) is measured routinely during laboratory rowing tests, it is necessary to obtain similar measurements during any on-water protocol. The MetaMax 3B portable indirect calorimetry system (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany) was therefore validated against a first-principles, laboratory-based indirect calorimetry system (MOUSe, Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra, Australia). VO2 from the MetaMax was significantly higher during submaximal exercise (p=0.03), although results were within 0.16 L.min-1 (4.1%) across all exercise intensities. There was good agreement between duplicate MetaMax trials separated by ~2 d; mean VO2 was within 0.11 L.min-1 (2.5%) and TE was &#161;&#220;2.3%.

The specificity of rowing testing was improved using an On-water incremental test that replicated a laboratory-based Ergometer protocol. However, the individual variation in physiological responses between-tests meant that training intensity recommendations from the Ergometer test were not always applicable to on-water training. Furthermore, measurements from the On-water protocol displayed similar or lesser reliability (TE=1.9-19.2%) compared with the Ergometer test (TE=0.1-11.0%). 

As an effective fitness test must also be sensitive to longitudinal changes, the responses to 6 wks training were compared between the Ergometer and On-water methods. The magnitude of On-water training effects were usually greater (small Cohen&#161;&#175;s effect size) compared with the Ergometer test (trivial effect), although On-water and Ergometer tests both indicated that training responses were negligible because virtually all changes were less than one of their respective TEs. Correlations between test results and rowing performance were largest when rowing mode was matched between conditions, but Ergometer results provided the highest correlations (Ergometer vs. 2000-m ergometer time-trial: R= -0.92 to -0.97 compared with On-water vs. On-water maximal power output: R=0.52 to 0.92).

Although On-water tests improved the specificity of on-water training prescriptions, these tests provided no obvious benefits for monitoring longitudinal fitness changes or performance compared with Ergometer tests. Given that On-water tests are also more time consuming and logistically challenging, their practical application is limited.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise physiology</field><field name="subject">rowing</field><field name="subject">ergometer</field><field name="subject">oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">blood lactate</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100302.133001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The processes and outcomes of professional learning in an innovative school: the construction of an explanatory model.</field><field name="creator">Bissaker, Kerry Ann</field><field name="description">Science and mathematics education in Australian senior secondary years is experiencing declining enrolments, negative student attitudes, a shortage of qualified teachers and a curriculum that lacks relevance to contemporary life (Masters, 2006, Smith, 2003, Tytler, 2007). Such evidence calls for transformation in secondary science and mathematics education and acknowledges that teachers&#146; professional learning is central to achieving required transformation. Fulton Senior Secondary School  is a purpose built school designed to respond to the perceived crisis in teaching and learning of science and mathematics in the final years of schooling. It is also the site in which this qualitative interpretive case study was conducted. The purpose of the research was to investigate the processes and outcomes of teachers&#146; professional learning in a setting that was designed to promote innovation and reform. 
The research, conducted over a period of six years, used grounded theory methods to answer  questions about what supported and sustained teachers&#146; learning, and what were the outcomes of this learning for teachers, students and the school. To achieve an authentic account of the teachers&#146; lived experiences, I positioned myself as an insider-researcher, working intensely and thoughtfully with staff at Fulton over a period of six years. The study revealed the nature of the interactions between contextual conditions, organisational elements and relationships factors that influenced teachers&#146; professional learning. An explanatory model of professional learning was developed as an outcome of the theorising process. This identified the importance of alignments between: teachers&#146; capacities, characteristics and sense of personal agency; and specific contextual conditions, organisational elements and relationship factors. Successful alignments were identified as affordances  for teachers&#146; learning and formed the basis of the explanatory model. In essence, the contextual conditions, organisational elements and relationship factors of Fulton provided the architecture of an explanatory model of professional learning. The teachers acted as explorers of this architecture.
The research revealed that teachers brought existing beliefs and practices to Fulton, but through incidental and intentional learning, these beliefs and practices were expanded and often changed. Teachers developed deep understanding of many factors associated with effective pedagogy including: learning and learning processes; new science and mathematics content; effective curriculum design; and authentic assessment processes. The teachers were open to challenges and recognised their roles as learners in achieving the vision of the school. Their outcomes varied, but each teacher&#146;s learning influenced both the students and the school as a learning organisation. There was considerable evidence that the investment in teachers as learners was pivotal to achieving the vision of transforming science and mathematics education in the senior secondary years at this school.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">professional learning</field><field name="subject">teachers' learning</field><field name="subject">organisational learning</field><field name="subject">science and mathematics professional learning</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100309.162227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unilateral conversations: the role of marked sentence initial elements in skilled senior secondary academic writing</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Heather</field><field name="description">This research is a practical attempt to develop academic writing pedagogy at secondary level in New Zealand because from interviews with teachers, personal experience and literature in the professional journal for teachers of English in New Zealand, English in Aotearoa, it appears that this would be a useful enterprise. Literature relating to this, and extending to the related contexts of the UK and Australia has been reviewed. The approach taken is an investigation of top-rated senior secondary writing in subject English, using elements of Hallidayan Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). The concepts of SFG chiefly drawn upon, namely, Theme and linguistic metafunctions, and their application to the data are presented and explained. This grammatical model was chosen because it allows the interface of grammatical structure and linguistic function to be explored, which in turn permits insight into how the qualities of top-rated writing may be formulated grammatically. This insight may then become part of teaching resources in academic writing by way of both pre- and in-service training material for teachers. Over 100 top-rated English literature essays (graded by teachers) were collected from students, via their schools, so that the data obtained were authentic. Two samples were collected: timed and untimed writing. Each sentence of each essay was typed into one of nine Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, representing locations within the essay. The nine locations were: three introduction locations: initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; three paragraph locations (all paragraphs in the body of the essays, not introductions or conclusions): initial sentence, medial sentences, terminal sentence; and, three conclusion locations: initial sentence, medial sentences and terminal sentence. The initial grammatical elements and their metafunction(s) for each sentence were categorised. Percentages in each category for each location were calculated so that individual locations could be compared for grammatical and metafunctional characteristics. Grouped locations were also considered where this seemed felicitous; for instance, introductions were compared to conclusions or medial sentences compared to boundary sentences (initial and terminal). Comparisons were also made between the timed and untimed samples. The results showed that some grammatical structures could be associated with particular grouped locations and metafunctional characteristics were not independent of location. The research was also able to suggest grammatical means to achieve metafunctional effects that align with descriptors for writing given by examination boards. For example, clear, logical organisation of writing is highly valued by examination boards. This is achieved by means of elements that perform the textual linguistic metafunction. A variety of grammatical elements to perform this function and their most prominent locations were identified. It is intended that the findings may be a highly directed way to help teachers address some of the writing challenges faced by their students at secondary level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary writing</field><field name="subject">Formal writing</field><field name="subject">Systemic functional grammar</field><field name="subject">Theme</field><field name="subject">Sentence initial elements</field><field name="subject">Linguistic metafunctions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International students' expectations of a twelve week IELTS Preparation Course</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Isobel</field><field name="description">The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) English proficiency test has been the focus of increasing research since its inception in 1989. While research has contributed to a better understanding of test construction and has highlighted the limitations of individual test scores for predicting academic success, few studies have focused on students&#8217; perceptions of the academic module of IELTS. The present study attempts to address this gap in the research by investigating student expectations of an IELTS preparation course. The study, adopting a multi-method approach using surveys and interviews, investigated ten international students enrolled in a twelve-week academic IELTS preparation course in a language school affiliated to a university in Auckland, New Zealand. The study found that students have high expectations not only of an IELTS preparation course, but of the IELTS band score they will achieve. The study also found that student expectations of the course were met at least to some extent. Various factors contributed to the fulfilment of students&#8217; expectations including a focus on speaking and listening activities and the use of formative practice tests. Although all four language skills were recognised by the students prior to the course as being important, speaking and listening were identified as those most expected to be improved. By the end of the course, however, reading and writing skills were acknowledged to be most important, suggesting a growing awareness of the importance of literacy skills, both for achieving an appropriate IELTS score and for further academic study. Although limited by the number of participants, the findings have significance for the development and delivery of academic IELTS preparation courses. Firstly, although there is value in focusing on listening and speaking skills, given the change in students&#8217; perceptions, academic literacy skills perhaps need a predominant focus. Related to this focus, challenging reading activities and related vocabulary development should be an integral part of the course. Secondly, the inclusion of practice IELTS tests provides an important formative component of preparation courses. Finally, the study suggests that administration staff and teachers need to better prepare students to have realistic expectations of an achievable IELTS band score.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IELTS</field><field name="subject">Preparation course</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese Common Knowledge, Tourism And Natural Landscapes</field><field name="creator">fm_sarah_li@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Tourism in its modern garb is very new to China. Not until 1978 when the bamboo curtain was parted and the &#145;Open Door&#146; policies introduced was international tourism welcomed. It is only 21 years ago, in 1984, that was tourism approved by the Chinese Government as an appropriate form of economic development that could contribute to the modernization of the country.

The form that tourism takes in contemporary China, especially the development and presentation of natural sights and sites, demonstrates qualities that immediately set it apart from western forms of tourism development. While there are similar aspects &#150; all part of the ubiquitous spread of &#145;globalization&#146; &#150; there is much that retains a unique Chineseness that is immediately distinctive. In analyzing the specific qualities of contemporary Chinese tourism it is argued that 4000 years of continuous culture, which has produced a body of understanding known as &#145;Chinese common knowledge&#146;,  has been fundamental in directing and determining the way in which natural landscapes are utilized for contemporary tourism. The values inherent in this enduring cultural heritage are an amalgamation of Confucian thought, Doaist and Buddhist theology, folklore and an extraordinarily rich literary heritage in which the poem and calligraphy are regarded as the highest art forms. They imbue every natural landscape with a cultural overlay, drawing upon the immense strength of Chinese common knowledge in ways which make many such sights and sites incomprehensible to non-Chinese visitors because no interpretation is provided - since none is needed for their Chinese viewers.

One outcome of this research is the identification of a Chinese tourist gaze that has many elements which distinguish it from the western tourist gaze.  It is highly structured through sociolinguistic parameters which feature correlative and relational thinking (in which no individual entity exists in isolation but is connected to all things around it in dynamic relationships), and this has produced what I have termed &#145;the relational tourist gaze&#146;.  The Chinese value system also includes a degree of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism that stands in opposition to the western biocentric approach to conservation and maintenance of &#145;naturalness&#146; and &#145;wilderness.&#146; There is a pervasive view that nature is imperfect and &#145;man&#146; has a responsibility to improve on nature to forge a symbiotic relationship, these sentiments summed up in the phrase known to all Chinese: &#145;man and nature in harmony&#146;. A significant component of a Chinese tourist gaze is thus what I have termed &#145;the harmony gaze&#146; that contrast strongly with current western notions about wilderness and pristine nature. 

This thesis defines Chineseness and Chinese common knowledge, examines the particularities of the sociolinguistics of Chinese to illustrate the way in which this cultural heritage has been transmitted down through the centuries to the present day, and then analyses the manifestation of this knowledge and its attendant values in incorporating natural landscapes - mountains, caves, rivers &#150; in contemporary tourism in China. The result is - &#145;Bie you tian di&#146; &#150; an altogether different world.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chinese common knowledge</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">natural landscapes</field><field name="subject">landscapes</field><field name="subject">common knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091112.134911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and evaluation of DNA vaccines in chickens against a wild bird H6N2 avian influenza virus from Western Australia</field><field name="creator">s.shan@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Genetic immunization, also known as DNA or polynucleotide immunisation, is well documented to induce broad-based immunity in various animal models of infectious and non-infectious diseases. However, the low potency of DNA vaccines has to date precluded the development of commercial vaccines. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate a number of parameters to improve the potency of DNA vaccines for use in chickens, using a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus as a proof-of-concept for their ability to produce a humoral immune response.       
The index virus used in the study was avian influenza virus A/coot/WA/2727/79 (H6N2), isolated from an apparently healthy Eurasian coot in 1979.  Prior to any DNA experiments the virus was rigorously characterized. The virus strain was shown to be an H6 subtype by haemaglutination inhibition (HI) testing and as an N2 subtype by gene sequence analysis. The isolate was shown to be able to grow on MDCK cells in the absence of exogenous trypsin. It was further biologically characterized as LPAI with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0.15 and a motif of 321PQAETRG328 at the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein. It was capable of infecting domestic chickens under experimental conditions with a low level of virus excretion via the cloaca and oropharynx following intravenous or oral and oculonasal inoculation. 
The full-length HA and nucleoprotein (NP) genes of this H6N2 virus were subsequently cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector VR1012 to generate VR-HA and VR-NP constructs. Six-week-old Hy-Line chickens were intramuscularly injected with either the VR-HA or VR-NP vaccine at different dose rates, with or without lipofectin as adjuvant. Minimal or no detectable antibody was produced, as measured by HI, ELISA and Western blotting-based assay, but high titres of H6-specific HI antibodies appeared 10 days after homologous virus challenge. In contrast to the empty vector controls, there was a significant difference in HI antibody titre between pre- and post-challenge in vaccinated birds, indicating some evidence for the priming effect of the DNA vaccines. Using the frequency of virus shedding as an indicator of protection, lower doses (50 or 100 &#166;&#204;g per chicken) of either adjuvanted VR-HA or VR-NP vaccine significantly reduced virus shedding in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs compared to higher doses (300 or 500 &#166;&#204;g per chicken ) or empty vector control chickens. Although two vaccinations with naked VR-HA alone were not sufficient to induce an effective immune response against a homologous virus challenge, further repeat vaccinations and incorporation of adjuvant did lead to the generation of low to moderate HI antibody titres in some chickens and resulted in no or reduced virus shedding after challenge.
Next, to examine the effect of expression vector, three different DNA vectors, pCI, pCI-neo and pVAX1 were used to clone the same HA gene and generate three DNA vaccine constructs. Once again, direct intramuscular injection of the three DNA constructs did not elicit measurable H6-specific HA antibody response in Hy-Line chickens but the 100 &amp;micro;g pCI-HA lipofectin adjuvanted vaccine group showed a significant increase in post-challenge HI titres from the naive control group, indicating that an anamnestic antibody response had been induced by the pCI-HA DNA vaccination. Compared with the controls, the three DNA constructs showed significantly reduced virus shedding in cloacal swabs post virus challenge, suggesting that the three DNA vaccines induced some level of immune response in vaccinated chickens. As with the VR-HA construct, the lower dose groups for each vaccine (50 or 100 &#61549;g) were more effective at reducing virus shedding from the cloaca than the higher dose group (300 &#61549;g). 
 To further investigate why the DNA vaccines did not elicit a measurable antibody response, the HA gene incorporating a Kozak enhancer sequence was cloned into an alternative expression vector, pCAGGS, to produce the pCAG-HAk construct. Three-week-old SPF chickens were immunized with this construct either by the intramuscular route (IM) or electroporation (EP). H6 HI antibodies  were present in some chickens by 3 weeks after the first IM vaccination and 75% of the chickens vaccinated with 10, 100 or 300 &amp;micro;g pCAG-HAk were antibody positive by 2 weeks after the second IM vaccination. For EP immunization, 87.5% of vaccinated birds seroconverted after the first vaccination and 100% seroconverted after the second vaccination and the H6 HI antibody titres were significantly higher than for chickens vaccinated by IM inoculation. Another group was given a single dose IM vaccination with 100 &amp;micro;g of the pCAG-HAk construct and showed a maximum sero-conversion rate of 53.3% with a peak H6 HI titre of 27 at 5 weeks post-vaccination. This demonstrated that optimization of the expression vector and insertion of a Kozak sequence could synergistically enhance expression of the H6 HA gene and result in a measurable H6 antibody response in SPF chickens. EP was also compared with IM inoculation with the 100 &#61549;g pCI-HA construct in SPF chickens, resulting in a 50% sero-conversion rate and mean HI titre of 21.3 at 2 weeks after the second vaccination by EP. By comparison, only 25% chickens had trace HI titres by IM inoculation. This indicated that EP was more efficient than IM delivery for both constructs. 
A codon-optimized complete HA gene from A/coot/WA/2727/79 (H6N2) was then chemically synthesized and cloned into a pCAGGS vector to generate the pCAG-optiHAk construct. SPF chickens immunized twice with either 10 &amp;micro;g or 100 &amp;micro;g of pCAG-optHA showed 37.5% and 87.5% sero-conversion rates respectively, with a mean H6 HI tire of 21.4 and 22.6 at 3 weeks after the second immunization, but the differences were not statistically significant. There were also no significant differences in either the sero-conversion rate or the H6 HI titre between the pCAG-HAk and pCAG-optiHAk groups, suggesting that a codon-optimized HA DNA vaccine did not achieve significantly better immunogenicity than the pCAG-HAk vaccine. 
In vitro expression of the developed DNA constructs in chicken-, hamster-, monkey- and human-origin cells, as measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence testing (IFT), showed the strength of H6 HA expression in the following descending order - pCAG-optiHAk/pCAG-HAk, pCI-HAk, VR-HA, pCI-HA, pCIneo-HA and pVAX-HA. The in vivo chicken vaccinations also showed that the pCI-HA construct was more effective than the pCI-neo-HA, and that the pCAG-optiHA or pCAG-HAk constructs were better than pCI-HAk in term of reduction in virus shedding after H6N2 virus challenge.  Thus, in vitro HA gene expression directly correlated with the generation of immune responses in vivo, indicating that in vitro studies can be used for pre-selection of expression plasmids prior to development of avian influenza DNA vaccines.
Lipofectin as a chemical adjuvant was shown to enhance the DNA-induced immune response but is prohibitively expensive for routine use in poultry vaccines. Thus, an experimental adjuvant for poultry DNA vaccines (Essai) and a new nanoparticle (Phema) adjuvant used for the first time in poultry were compared with conventional aluminum salts (alum) adjuvant in the present study. No HI antibody was detected in any adjuvant-vaccinated Hy-Line chickens following two immunizations. However, in comparison with the naive control group, the alum- and Phema adjuvanted pCAG-HAk groups significantly reduced the frequency of virus shedding in oropharyngeal swabs, but Essai adjuvant was not effective in augmenting the pCAG-HAk vaccine efficacy. This pilot study also emphasised that the traditional aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, either DNA binding or non-binding, may be useful as an adjuvant for enhancing DNA-induced immune responses in chickens owing to its low price and safety record. 
Overall, DNA immunization with various HA-expressing constructs was shown to be variably effective in inducing immune responses in chickens. The efficacy of DNA vaccines could be synergistically improved by taking appropriate approaches. With continuing research DNA vaccines have the potential to become an important tool for disease prevention and control.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA vaccine</field><field name="subject">avian influenza H6N2 virus</field><field name="subject">haemagglutinin</field><field name="subject">nucleoprotein</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100211.201257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and Hierarchy Within International Society: Liberal Interventionism in the Post-Cold War Era</field><field name="creator">clapton_14@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">Several recent works have emphasised contemporary hierarchical trends within international society. These trends have been most readily demonstrated by the willingness of dominant states, such as the United States, to conduct interventions in support of the promotion of liberal values and political institutions. Yet while many scholars have identified new relations of hierarchy within international society, few have explored what they suggest regarding international society&#146;s normative constitution or what factors have given rise to these new hierarchies. The end of colonialism in the 1960&#146;s resulted in a fundamental reconstitution of international society. The result of decolonisation was that pluralism, the notion that all states have the equal freedom to constitute their internal socio-political and economic institutions as they see fit, was entrenched as the central constitutive principle of the post-colonial international society. 

Contemporary hierarchical trends suggest a transition away from this pluralist constitution, with resultant changes in the processes of inclusion and exclusion and modes of interaction between different members of international society. This thesis aims to explore these processes of reconstitution within international society in the post-Cold War era and explain why Western societies have felt compelled to intervene in particular territories in order to promote liberal values. Utilising sociological theories of risk, particularly the work of Ulrich Beck, this thesis suggests that a new &#145;liberal social logic of risk&#146; underpins the emergence of new forms of hierarchy and contemporary constitutional transition within international society. New forms of temporally and spatially de-bounded security risks (such as terrorism), and Western attempts at managing these risks through intervention and the imposition of liberal values in so-called &#145;risky zones&#146;, has altered the constitution of international society in a way that gives rise to various hierarchical and anti-pluralist trends.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">heirarchy</field><field name="subject">international society</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="subject">pluralism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100224.155255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring youth civic development in Malaysia: Conceptualization, instrument development using the Rasch measurement model, and substantive outcomes</field><field name="creator">etor@nd.edu.au</field><field name="description">This study concerned the development of measures for youth civic development in Malaysia with four major goals in mind, namely conceptual, measurement, baseline/pragmatic, and predictive goals. It was a preliminary study of its kind in Malaysia as Malaysia did not participate in any international or regional study such as the IEA Civic Study. The central intention of the study was to establish a conceptually valid assessment framework and psychometrically sound instruments for the measurement of youth civic development in Malaysia. This would, in turn, provide some baseline information upon which future research on youth civic development in Malaysia could build.

Civics as a subject was removed from the Malaysian school curriculum in the early 1980s and Civic and Citizenship Education as a specific subject, with an explicit structure and curriculum framework, was reintroduced only in 2005. It was not feasible at the time when this study was conducted to conduct a specific assessment on the outcomes for school-aged students as explicated and expected in the curriculum framework. Therefore, the post-school-aged group of young undergraduates in public universities within the age range of 17-28 was selected as the target population.

Firstly, a conceptualisation of youth civic development was synthesized by identifying current views on citizenship, as set out in the international literature and, specifically, in Malaysia in two major documents &#150; the Rukenagara and Vision2020. Civic development consists of three variables of Civic Knowledge (CK) (knowledge about the legal status and associated rights and responsibilities of citizens); Civic Disposition (CD) (views on identity and attitudes as a citizen); and Civic Engagement (CE) (participation as a citizen). The relationship between civic development variables was explicated through a Neo-Vygotskian cultural-historical theory of human development. In addition, Bronfenbrenner&#146;s Socio-Ecological Theory of human development was adopted for the selection of contextual and individual factors (the independent variables) for the conceptual model. To help ensure cross-cultural validity for use within the Malaysian socio-cultural context, the three dependent variables of CK, CD and CE, and the independent variables were appraised for their suitability for use within the Malaysian socio-cultural context before they were operationalized into observable indicators.

Secondly, the Rasch measurement paradigm, framework and model were adopted as the foundation for instrument development and validation. The procedures for instrument development followed Wilson&#146;s model of four building blocks of instrument development (Wilson, 2005). Three instruments were developed for this study, namely The Malaysian Civic Knowledge Inventory (MCKI), The Malaysian Civic Disposition Inventory (MCDI), and the Malaysian Civic Engagement Inventory (MCEI).  Items from existing instruments in international literature were adopted or adapted for the three instruments, especially the MCEI, if there was construct equivalence in Rukunegara and Vision 2020. This was to ensure a cumulative tradition in research on youth civic development. Most of the items in the MCKI and the MCDI however were developed specifically for this study to capture the specificity of the civic culture of Malaysia.

The target population for the study was undergraduate students enrolled in Malaysian public universities. Students at one public university were chosen as the accessible population.  Data were collected in February 2006 (pilot study) and from July to August 2006 (main study). The sample for this study (N=1391) was drawn through multistage cluster sampling by study concentration, level of study, and clusters based on lecture/tutorial group. The sample also, by default, included major inherent characteristics of the target population, particularly gender (Male and Female) and ethnicity (Malay, Chinese, Indian and other ethnic groups).

Rasch analyses confirmed the three-dimensional structure of youth civic development. Three measurement scales with acceptable psychometric properties were established to provide measures for the three dependent variables of CK, CD and CE.  The hypotheses about civic development (in terms of CK, CD and CE) as a &#145;tool and result&#146; activity were tested through path analyses of mediational relationships based on Baron and Kenny&#146;s criteria (1986) using the Rasch-derived linearized scores from the main study. Analyses provided statistical support for a bidirectional association between each pair of CK, CD and CE, despite the low inter-correlations between them.

This study revealed that, on average, youth in this study demonstrated a moderately high level of CK (Mean =1.11, SD = 0.77), a positive CD (Mean = 1.25; SD = 0.63) but a moderately low CE (Mean = -0.44; SD = 0.92).  The Malay sub-sample scored, on average, higher on all three dimensions of civic development. The results of hierarchical multiple regressions however showed the effect of ethnicity (Malay or Non-Malay) was statistically non-significant when other contextual (home, curricular and co-curricular) variables were entered into the regression equation. This indicates it is not ethnicity that predicts levels of civic development, but rather it is the differences in other socio-political entitlements and status associated with ethnic status. Three selected collective social-contextual factors of home, curriculum and co-curriculum explained only a fairly modest but statistically significant amount of variance (10 to 20%) in the dependent variables.

Finally, the findings were discussed in relation to the theoretical perspectives undergirding this study.  Pragmatic implications for policy planning as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in youth civic development are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rasch Model</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Youth Civic Development</field><field name="subject">Instrument Development</field><field name="subject">Instrument Validation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100227.153706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models, processes, and factors influencing internationalisation: the case of Malaysian smes</field><field name="creator">zizahsenik@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the processes and influential factors affecting the internationalisation of SMEs in manufacturing industries in Malaysia. Internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been widely researched but little is known of how and why internationalisation takes place in developing countries and this lack of evidence in the literature provides strong grounds for this study. Jones and Coviello (2005) suggest investigation of internationalisation should include the broad range of internationalisation theories, such as the Incremental and Rapid internationalisation models, Networking, Resource-based and International Entrepreneurship perspectives. These perspectives examine the awareness, process, driving forces and influential factors relevant to SME internationalisation. Therefore, the patterns and dimensions of internationalisation, including the modes of foreign entry, market selection, triggering factors, awareness of international opportunities were investigated, as were the problems and challenges faced by internationalising firms and the key drivers influencing the internationalisation process.

A critical realism paradigm and qualitative method were employed. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Malaysian experts and 54 Malaysian-based CEOs, owners, and/ or key executives from SME manufacturing industries using a semi-structured interview guide. The data was analysed with the statistical package NVivo 7 and also manually to improve triangulation of the results. The results are largely inductive and interpretive and are presented in qualitative-themes as well as some basic statistical analyses. 

The findings indicate that interrelated factors influence the internationalisation process of Malaysian SMEs. Various paces, a myriad of entry modes and broad market scopes determine the pattern of internationalisation undertaken. A traditional internationalisation pattern is strongly evident, although some companies exhibited rapid and born global patterns, depending on their industry, products, organisational competencies, knowledge and access to information or because of a change of management. The main drivers of internationalisation centred on key personnel and firm competencies. The study also found that while domestic and global forces motivate internationalisation, aspects of Government policy, procedures and international requirements inhibit the process. More importantly, the findings suggest that networking relationships create internationalisation awareness and provide appropriate pathways to internationalisation for manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia and this is an area where strategies could be improved. The increasing emphasis on the SME sector for enhancing economic and social development in Malaysia means they can make substantial contributions to development and understanding how to improve internationalisation strategies will increase those gains. More transparent government policies and coherence among supporting agencies as well as structured and relevant networks would assist the internationalisation of Malaysian SMEs. Currently, internationalisation processes are constrained by limited resources and difficulty in accessing assistance and supports. This study provides new knowledge and important insights that will benefit manufacturing and other industries in Malaysia and other developing countries.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing</field><field name="subject">Driving forces</field><field name="subject">Networking</field><field name="subject">Developing countr</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100309.122732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solar PV Electrification Programs in Developing Countries:  Towards an Holistic Approach</field><field name="creator">T.Urmee@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Rural renewable electrification programs are increasingly being used as a means of providing the rural poor in developing countries with access to electricity. Those programs have varied significantly in design and implementation, as well as in their degrees of success.

These projects ignored or overlooked the vital question of how ongoing operational, maintenance and replacement costs would be met. Many genuine programs, however, also met with limited success and much effort has been invested in attempting to understand the reasons for this lack of success. To increase the rates of success of these programs, best practice guidelines were developed. Despite these efforts, many programs have continued to meet with limited success. These points required better explanations of the reasons for program success and failure, which requires a greater understanding of these programs. 
This thesis looks more closely at solar PV electrification programs being undertaken in the Asia-Pacific region to understand why some programs continue to be more successful than others. It aims to understand the decisions behind the planning and implementation of the programs and the reasons that are being implemented in the way that they are, the selection of program objectives, the actual benefits of the programs the and causes of any factors that contribute to their apparent success or lack of success. This understanding is obtained by undertaking in-depth comprehensive field surveys to obtain the views of all program stakeholders. The outcomes of these field surveys are then used to develop a comprehensive set of success criteria and a set of indicators that can be used to measure the success of rural renewable electrification programs. A roadmap that could be followed by the program planners and implementers to ensure program success is also provided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar PV electrification</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Successfulness</field><field name="subject">Implementation mechanism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100311.121220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enigmatic Pearls: Authorship and Representation: Competing Cultural Positions in Pilbara Pearl, Nullarbor Pearl and Shoalwater Pearl</field><field name="creator">rossetticreenplys@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">This work is an inquiry into the creative pathways I have undertaken, as a screenplay author, when formulating a body of work, which interrogates issues of importance to me, as a Caucasian, Australian, multicultural, female author, writing within a fictional feature film script construct. It is an interdisciplinary investigation, punctuated by self consciousness. Mindful of my own subject position, I believe my negotiations through this, as reflected in the body of my past and present work, have created an original thesis which argues for the aesthetic, reconciliatory power of screenplays. In wishing to create a positive lead role for an Indigenous actress, I had to ultimately put aside reservations about my origins as a non-Indigenous screenwriter. As a screenplay author, I will demonstrate why I find it hard not to agree with Michel Foucault&#146;s supposition that: &#147;it is not enough to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared&#148; (Foucault 101).

The creative component of my thesis is a magic realist feature film script, entitled Shoalwater Pearl, written as a prequel to the two other enclosed film scripts largely written outside of this doctoral thesis, featuring the same lead character, Pearl. Pearl carries the weight of my self-consciousness, and through her, I reveal the creative pathways I simultaneously interrogate as I research theoretical issues of importance to me as a screenplay author.

Faris could not have more aptly put it, regarding the magic realist aim, which I have adapted to my representation of Pearl, as, &#147;a disturbing element, a grain of sand in the oyster of [. . .] realism&#148; (Faris 168).

The theoretical component of my thesis is interwoven with theories of Authorship and Representation including issues of Identity, Aboriginality, Multiculturalism and Gender to better document how my creative and theoretical pathways intertwine, followed by a short Conclusion, Bibliography and Filmography. The Chapter titles, &#145;Authorship&#146; and &#145;Representation&#146; are used advisedly, as it could be argued that they are controversial subjects. It will be revealed that none of these terms can be considered as stable or abiding. However, each chapter introduces its title as a methodological and normative term for a category or definition from which the chapter emerges.

As a result of my interdisciplinary approach, I have posited an original pathway for other screenplay authors, who, whilst remaining mindful of marketplace interests, may also enter into identity politics or study social movements in order to create screenplays representing contentious aspects of cultural change in contemporary Australia, whilst paying homage to their own unresolved issues or unique life narratives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100316.114926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling student performance in a tertiary preparatory course</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Colin S.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: In this dissertation a review of the literature as it applies to the modelling of educational performance data is undertaken. Statistical linear models, including the novel Beta, Tweedie and Tobit regression models, are then applied to the performance data of students who have undertaken a preparatory mathematics course. These models are then critically reviewed and compared with the commonly used standard linear regression model.Issues that arise from the application of statistical linear models to educational performance data are then explored. For example, the effects of non-Normality, which characterizes educational performance data, and thepresence of large numbers of students who fail to complete the course (a characteristic of this particular context), are examined and reported. Both of these effects can violate the underlying assumptions of the standard linearregression model. Simulation studies are then used to assess the appropriateness of the linear model when it is applied under the condition of non-Normality and the presence of large numbers of missing observations.Findings from this study indicate that issues relating to model effectiveness are clouded in the educational context by typically large values of the error variance (high noise) and the difficulty in finding suitable performancepredictors. Educational models of performance typically lack statistical power, so that in many instances it doesn&#8217;t matter what model is applied to the data. Nevertheless, the study highlights many reasons why modelsalternative to the standard linear regression model should be applied to such data. For example, in situations where the effect is not constant over the entire domain of the explanatory variable, a linear model based upon the betadistribution will be much more appropriate. Similarly, in situations where the performance data contains exact zeros (for example the performance of students who withdraw from the course without providing any measure of achievement) it is more appropriate to use a Tweedie linear model than the standard linear regression model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">modelling;</field><field name="subject">educational</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">data;</field><field name="subject">statistical</field><field name="subject">linear</field><field name="subject">models;</field><field name="subject">tertiary</field><field name="subject">preparatory</field><field name="subject">class</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003577/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of the regulation of DNA damage and other host responses by fish oil for colorectal oncogenesis.</field><field name="creator">Nyskohus, Laura Sophia</field><field name="description">The acute cellular responses to DNA damaging agents are critical in determining the long term outcome of disease.  A cell&#146;s susceptibility to damage, or its capacity to remove or repair this damage, all contributes to the eventual health or disease of tissues.  This process is especially crucial in colonic epithelial cells and in the development of colorectal oncogenesis.  The colonic lumen is constantly subjected to different environmental compounds that may have genotoxic properties that can initiate mutational events and possibly carcinogenesis.  Therefore, the study of a regulatory dietary agent that improves the colonic cells ability to withstand damage, improve repair and retain its general health is a significant and practical tool in the fight against colorectal cancer.

The health benefits of fish oil, including its potential chemopreventative properties, have been reported in numerous studies.  However, the mechanism by which this protective effect occurs remains unclear.  A gap in current literature exists that fails to explore the effect of fish oil on the early cellular responses to carcinogenic agents.  Therefore, this thesis aims to firstly, better understand the specific host responses to an insult of carcinogen in vivo; secondly, to determine if regulation of these responses can be achieved by dietary fish oil; and lastly, to explore the potential consequences of this regulation for colorectal oncogenesis.

All experimental work was carried out using a rat &#150; azoxymethane (AOM) animal model of colorectal carcinogenesis.  The key host responses to the carcinogen that were measured included the formation of acute O6methyldeoxyGuanosine (O6medG) DNA damage, the acute apoptotic response to genotoxic carcinogen (AARGC) and cell proliferation rates.  A novel immunochemical assay was designed to detect both the levels and distribution of O6medG in colonic cells.  With this established, a pattern of these host responses were mapped out over time.  A dietary intervention study trialling a range of fish oil diets containing different doses and forms was then carried out to determine if modulation of responses occurred.  This study was then followed on by a longer term study that explored the consequences of regulation by fish oil on pre-neoplastic lesions in the colon.

The acute host responses to an insult of AOM showed that colonic O6medG formation began 2h post AOM administration and peaked at 6h.  The AARGC response followed the pattern of O6medG by a 2h delay, peaking at 8h post AOM administration, while cell proliferation rates decreased significantly after 6h.

The inclusion of tuna oil in the diet did not affect either the AARGC or cell proliferation rates when given in any form or at any dose.  Animals fed a diet with 15% free tuna oil and 7% encapsulated tuna oil did however have significantly reduced levels of O6medG DNA damage in the distal colon.  This reduction in O6medG levels did not translate into a reduction of ACF lesion, with a protective effect against ACF lesions only being observed in animals fed the high dose fish oil groups. 

Analysis of the data suggest that the acute host responses to an insult of DNA damaging agent appear to be closely related, all reaching their peak level of response 6-8h after the insult.  The short time frame between both O6medG and apoptosis also did not support the current popular theory which explains O6medG mediated apoptosis. An alternate hypothesised BER mediated apoptotic pathway was also not supported.

Regulation of the acute apoptotic response or the cell proliferation rate was not achieved by dietary fish oil.  However, a high dose fish oil diet did regulate the level of O6medG in colonic epithelial cells by significantly reducing the total O6medG DNA damage load.   This reduction of O6medG by a high fish oil diet however, was not translated into a protective effect against the formation of pre-neoplastic lesions.  These data suggests that regulation of the acute O6medG response to a damaging agent does not necessarily imply protection for longer term colorectal oncogenesis.  Additional studies exploring both the effect of fish oil on AOM metabolising enzymes and also a longer term cancer study may help to answer some pertinent questions evolving from this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA adduct</field><field name="subject">apoptosis</field><field name="subject">fish oil</field><field name="subject">colon cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090730.115059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of Patients&#146; and Nurses&#146; Perceptions of Cancer Patients&#146; Quality of Life: 
A Mixed Research Approach</field><field name="creator">Bahrami, Masoud</field><field name="description">In attempting to give more years of life to cancer patients, their Quality of Life (QoL) during this time has frequently been compromised. Assessment of patients&#146; QoL provide nurses with an opportunity to know about the whole range of patients&#146; needs and desires. These information would be potentially very useful for health care professionals particularly nurses for planning, conducting and evaluating the nursing care of cancer patients.
 
Questionnaire survey research carried out in countries other than Australia identified a varied amount of agreement between cancer patients and nurses about cancer patients&#146; QoL. However, based on the literature review, no research study has been found in Australia that provides a detailed understanding of how nurses and cancer patients are similar or different in their perceptions of cancer patients&#146; QoL. A research study, therefore, was conducted to answer the following key questions: (a) what differences and/or similarities are there between patients&#146; and nurses&#146; perceptions of cancer patients&#146; QoL; (b) why do these differences and/or similarities exist? 

A research study with a mixed approach was undertaken to answer the research questions. In the first phase, a survey by questionnaire was conducted. The main aims were to identify: (a) the level of agreement between cancer patients&#146; and nurses&#146; scores on the World Health Organisation&#146;s Quality of Life Brief questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF); and (b) variables that may influence the level of agreement between them. Each patient and nurse was invited to complete the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire, which was considered as an appropriate tool for evaluating cancer patients&#146; QoL. This questionnaire considers QoL across four domains or dimensions: physical, psychological, social relationship and environmental.

In the first phase of the study, 166 cancer patients and 95 nurses were recruited from three major hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. The patients had a range of cancer diagnoses with breast cancer being the most prevalent. Most patients were being treated as inpatients with chemotherapy being their primary treatment. The mean age of nurses was approximately 37 years and their clinical experience with cancer patients averaged approximately eight years. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between patients&#146; and nurses&#146; scores ranged from &#145;poor&#146; in the social relationship and psychological domains up to &#145;moderate&#146; in the physical domain indicating that generally nurses were different in their perceptions from those of cancer patients. Another major finding of this phase was that nurses underestimated cancer patients&#146; QoL in the social relationship and environmental aspects, which consisted of more personal and private issues.

Having finished the first phase, the second phase was conducted based on the principles of a classical version or mode of grounded theory. The aim here was to include an interpretive perspective and explore the reasons why nurses may differ in their perceptions about cancer patients&#146; QoL in comparison to cancer patients. In this phase, three cancer patients and 10 nurses took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants were selected from different inpatient and outpatient oncology services and a palliative setting.

Differences in patients&#146; and nurses&#146; perceptions about cancer patients&#146; QoL and their implications for nursing clinical practice were discussed further in the light of six important categories found in the second phase including: QoL meanings, QoL aspects, Cues-based QoL assessment; Purpose-based QoL assessment; Facilitators of QoL assessment; and Barriers to QoL assessment. It emerged that QoL has individualised meanings and nurses generally have difficulties understanding their patients&#146; personal perspective or definition of QoL. Another interpretive outcome that may explain why nurses differed in their perceptions when compared with cancer patients is that nurses&#146; assessment of cancer patients&#146; QoL in oncology wards is mainly made during their interaction with patients when providing care. Such an assessment has a focus on physical cues and may not facilitate nurses developing a more holistic picture of cancer patients&#146; QoL. Participants in the interpretive phase indicated that time limitations, focus on care tasks, and discontinuity of care, all work against nurses developing a more accurate understanding of cancer patients&#146; QoL. Conversely, it was found that building a relationship and stronger rapport with patients is the main facilitator in improving nurses&#146; understanding of cancer patients&#146; QoL.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">quality of life</field><field name="subject">oncology patients</field><field name="subject">oncology nurses</field><field name="subject">World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief questionnaire</field><field name="subject">nursing care</field><field name="subject">Interpretive research</field><field name="subject">Mixed research approach</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080715.125510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simplified Diagnostic and Management Strategies for the Diagnosis and Delivery of Health Care to those with Obstructive Sleep Apnea</field><field name="creator">Antic, Nicholas</field><field name="description">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disease. Often resources to provide care for OSA are inadequate, leading to long patient waiting times. Simpler validated methods of care are needed.
In the first study in Chapter 2, the utility of a new high-sampling rate oximeter to diagnose OSA was explored. The home oximetry data collection was robust, with few failures and the data allowed the &#147;rule in&#148; or &#147;rule out&#148; of moderate-severe OSA with high degree of certainty. It is concluded that home oximetry could replace polysomnography (PSG) as a diagnostic test in a significant proportion of patients,  thus allowing limited resources available for the care of those with OSA to be re-directed e.g. towards providing therapy.
In Chapter 3, the diagnostic information from the oximeter was used to underpin a study designed to demonstrate that a nurse-led model of care could produce health outcomes in moderate-severe OSA not inferior to physician-led care.
A randomised controlled multi-centre non-inferiority clinical trial was performed. 1,427 patients referred to 3 sleep medical centres with possible OSA were assessed. 195 patients were randomised to 2 models of care. Model A, a simplified model, involved home oximetry to diagnose moderate-severe OSA, auto-titrating constant positive airway pressure  (APAP) to set a therapeutic constant positive airway pressure (CPAP), with all care supervised by an experienced nurse. Model B involved 2 laboratory PSG&#146;s, to diagnose OSA then titrate CPAP, supervised by a sleep physician. The primary endpoint was change in Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) measured before and after 3 months of CPAP. A range of other outcome measures were collected. 
The change in ESS for nurse-led management (Model A) was not inferior to the physician-led service (Model B) since the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI did not include -2, the margin of equivalence (difference 0.13, 95% CI -1.52 to -1.25). 11 patients in Model A and 10 in Model B were lost to follow up during the trial. There were no significant differences between Model A and Model B after 3 months of CPAP in any of the other outcome measures, including CPAP adherence at 3 months.
It is concluded that a simplified nurse-led model of care can produce non-inferior results to physician-directed care in the management of moderate-severe OSA. 
In Chapter 4 the efficacy of CPAP in normalising or improving subjective and objective sleepiness, quality of life and selected neurocognitive measures was explored. It was shown that only a proportion of patients (60% on ESS, 35% on FOSQ) normalised their scores after 3 months of CPAP therapy. This is important information. As new health care delivery strategies evolve as a result of the data presented in Chapter 3 and elsewhere, it will be crucially important to train new health care professionals in the complexities of OSA management, such that they are aware that the symptoms of patients presenting for OSA investigations can have multiple aetiologies, and may not always resolve by simply applying CPAP.
The data presented in this thesis add to the evidence base in treatment of moderate-severe OSA and will help further evolve health care delivery for this important disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">OSA</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">simplified management</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20081022.170508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anatomy of two medical archetypes : a socio-historical study of Australian doctors and their rival medical systems</field><field name="creator">c.farag@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">In this thesis it is argued that the migration of ideas and personnel from Britain to colonial Australia resulted in the reproduction of two distinctive medical archetypes, namely, the soldier/saviour and the generalist (family) physician and surgeon.  These have been both conceptualised as&#148; ideal type&#148; carriers or expediters of two rival forms of medical professionalism. They each emerged in the &#145;modern&#146; era as institutional products of distinctive educational processes and work practices available for doctors in 19th and 20th century Britain and Australia. While Freidson (1988) asserts one of the problems of dealing with studies of professionalism is that researchers have failed to clearly define work patterns, he could be seen as being close to Foucault (1973) whose emphasis was on the different social spaces in which practitioners worked.  

I show firstly that the career of the &#145;imperial&#146; army medical officer was revived in the 19th century so that in colonial contexts they could alternate between military and civilian servicing, especially as administrators and managers in public office. The soldier/saviour was also associated with the 19th century revival of Masonic and quasi-Masonic military and religious orders, consecrated by royal sovereigns and exported to Australia.  In contrast, the Scottish pedagogues and other generalist doctors coming to Australia from Britain were influenced by Edinburgh University&#146;s Medical Faculty&#146;s humanist traditions and design of the &#147;modern&#148; medical curriculum producing the generalist physician and surgeon who met community needs. Within wider imperial social relations, these generalist doctors were looked upon as &#145;dissenting&#146; or counter-hegemonic.  

The aim of this thesis is to examine these archetypes in terms of their characteristics of rationalisation to analyse and understand their professional differences historically as well as in the contemporary period. The significance is that one does not often come across studies which specifically look at doctors within the same society in such terms. Furthermore, by locating them within wider hegemonic and counter-hegemonic social relations, links between ideas about medical professionalism and issues of human rights become evident. This follows the World Health Organization&#146;s directives to treat health or medical issues and human rights as a cross-cutting research activity. To my knowledge, no study has been undertaken in Australia of the background and impact of these different traditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical professionalism</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">human rights</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080625.134351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental nonparametric discriminant analysis based active learning and its applications</field><field name="creator">Dhoble, Kshitij</field><field name="description">Learning is one such innate general cognitive ability which has empowered the living animate entities and especially humans with intelligence. It is obtained by acquiring new knowledge and skills that enable them to adapt and survive. With the advancement of technology, a large amount of information gets amassed. Due to the sheer volume of increasing information, its analysis is humanly unfeasible and impractical. Therefore, for the analysis of massive data we need machines (such as computers) with the ability to learn and evolve in order to discover new knowledge from the analysed data. The majority of the traditional machine learning algorithms function optimally on a parametric (static) data. However, the datasets acquired in real practices are often vast, inaccurate, inconsistent, non-parametric and highly volatile. Therefore, the learning algorithms&#8217; optimized performance can only be transitory, thus requiring a learning algorithm that can constantly evolve and adapt according to the data it processes. In light of a need for such machine learning algorithm, we look for the inspiration in humans&#8217; innate cognitive learning ability. Active learning is one such biologically inspired model, designed to mimic humans&#8217; dynamic, evolving, adaptive and intelligent cognitive learning ability. Active learning is a class of learning algorithms that aim to create an accurate classifier by iteratively selecting essentially important unlabeled data points by the means of adaptive querying and training the classifier on those data points which are potentially useful for the targeted learning task (Tong &amp; Koller, 2002). The traditional active learning techniques are implemented under supervised or semi-supervised learning settings (Pang et al., 2009). Our proposed model performs the active learning in an unsupervised setting by introducing a discriminative selective sampling criterion, which reduces the computational cost by substantially decreasing the number of irrelevant instances to be learned by the classifier. The methods based on passive learning (which assumes the entire dataset for training is truly informative and is presented in advance) prove to be inadequate in a real world application (Pang et al., 2009). To overcome this limitation, we have developed Active Mode Incremental Nonparametric Discriminant Analysis (aIncNDA) which undertakes adaptive discriminant selection of the instances for an incremental NDA learning. NDA is a discriminant analysis method that has been incorporated in our selective sampling technique in order to reduce the effects of the outliers (which are anomalous observations/data points in a dataset). It works with significant efficiency on the anomalous datasets, thereby minimizing the computational cost (Raducanu &amp; Vitri&#180;a, 2008). NDA is one of the methods used in the proposed active learning model. This thesis presents the research on a discrimination-based active learning where NDA is extended for fast discrimination analysis and data sampling. In addition to NDA, a base classifier (such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)) is applied to discover and merge the knowledge from the newly acquired data. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated against benchmark University of California, Irvine (UCI) datasets, face image, and object image category datasets. The assessment that was carried out on the UCI datasets showed that Active Mode Incremental NDA (aIncNDA) performs at par and in many cases better than the incremental NDA with a lower number of instances. Additionally, aIncNDA also performs efficiently under the different levels of redundancy, but has an improved discrimination performance more often than a passive incremental NDA. In an application that undertakes the face image and object image recognition and retrieval task, it can be seen that the proposed multi-example active learning system dynamically and incrementally learns from the newly obtained images, thereby gradually reducing its retrieval (classification) error rate by the means of iterative refinement. The results of the empirical investigation show that our proposed active learning model can be used for classification with increased efficiency. Furthermore, given the nature of network data which is large, streaming, and constantly changing, we believe that our method can find practical application in the field of Internet security.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Incremental learning</field><field name="subject">Active learning</field><field name="subject">Image recognition</field><field name="subject">Nonparametric analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">User directed search based reverse engineering</field><field name="creator">Schmidt, Frederik</field><field name="description">The current research represents the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of a user directed software clustering approach that utilizes Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). The aim of this research is to examine if a user directed software clustering approach contributes to the quality of software clustering. Because of the explorative and constructive character this research project utilises the System Development Research Methodology. This research is enabled by the implementation of the Search Based Reverse Engineering (SBRE) component. The SBRE component features multiple similarity measurements and the inclusion of user constraints in the clustering process to create different implementation perspectives of the software system depending on the requirements and preferences of the stakeholders. These similarity measurements are based on software metrics, which measure different software-attributes. The SBRE component utilizes a greedy and tabu search algorithm for the identification of the cluster landscape of the analyzed software systems. The evaluation showed that a user controlled SBSE cluster approach is able to adapt to different user configurations and derive corresponding cluster landscapes from software systems. Different measures are introduced to control the cluster process. It has been shown how these measures contribute to the quality of the clustering. It is demonstrated that tabu search is applicable in the field of software clustering. Finally, it has been examined that a multiple metric approach allows adapting the clustering process to the requirements of the stakeholders and the design of the software system to optimize the clustering result.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Search based software engineering</field><field name="subject">Reverse engineering</field><field name="subject">SBSE</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="subject">Java</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BLUE-PRINT: Human/Hydrokinetic Drawing Projects</field><field name="creator">Geurts, James</field><field name="description">Blue-Print: Human/Hydrokinetic Drawing Projects, is based on an expanded field of drawing practice, centering on a series of spatial and time-based projects at various bodies of water around the world. Blue-Print drawing projects set out to describe a language that articulates a human/hydrokinetic relationship. This expanded drawing practice emerges through diverse forms of installation, video, land-art, kinetic sculpture, light works, sensor-drawing, photography, living-monochromes, sound, durational events and research.       This expanded drawing practice is based on an inquiry into the relationships between land/place and thought/movement. It addresses the processes through which landscape, and its forms, are internalised in conceptual space, and the ways in which conceptual frameworks are projected outwards onto the landscape.       The work is informed by, and contributes to, the paradigms of eco-poetics and psychogeography. Both of these paradigms engage with the relationships between the physical world and the human experience of space and time. Combining the two through my practice creates a view of the environment and the human as two interdependent circulatory systems. Bodies of water/weather cycles/conceptual systems/the human as a water-body, these are subjects in my work as much as the sense of circulation comes through methodologically and aesthetically in the actual making and form of my expanded drawings.      This approach to art practice uses process in a particular way, that is as a primary means of making an artwork, although it could be said that such an approach is also an anti-method in as much as the 'method' is variable - it is continually invented given the situation/circumstances. What is consistent is a dynamic of proliferation; the work spreads out in different directions and in unpredictable ways. Here process is not for 'outcome' but is the work itself.      My overall practice has taken drawing as the base from which to work. My works are combinational and connective. They are based on a type of research that is deliberate, intense and composite, and which activates the spaces of transformation that exist in the movement between landscape and thought, the circulation between environment and human.      This investigation uses human engagement with moving bodies of water to generate drawings in a variety of ways, according to the specifics of each hydrokinetic system. This interest in human/hydrokinetic relationships stems from my experiences as a surfer and surfing is one of the means with which I create drawing works within this investigation. I am interested in the unique and dynamic complexity of hydrokinetics in each of the chosen locations and how this complexity of movement influences the drawing/ recording process.       I am interested in generating real-time drawing works from the particular intersection of: place; time; human/hydrokinetic activity; ecological forces at work and the specific ways in which these variables all affect the resultant form of abstraction. Further to this I am interested in exploring the capacity of abstraction to access, and refer to, psychological space more readily than naturalistic renderings of the landscape.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drawing</field><field name="subject">Land-art</field><field name="subject">psycho-geography</field><field name="subject">eco-poetics</field><field name="subject">installation</field><field name="subject">hydrokinetics</field><field name="subject">ephemeral</field><field name="subject">video</field><field name="subject">photography.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100326.114926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk and resilience: the role of risk and protective factors in the lives of young people over time</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Peter Gordon</field><field name="description">In 1998, 12 students, aged 11-12 years, were identified by primary schools in a socially disadvantaged area of New Zealand as being at risk of negative life outcomes, as a consequence of known adversities in their lives. The students were interviewed, as were their parents and teachers, and they also completed learning assessments and measures of personal and social concerns. The purpose of these evaluations was to identify risk and protective factors in the young people&#8217;s lives, and to make estimations of personal resilience. In 2008, nine of the original study participants, who were now aged 21-22 years and in emerging adulthood, were located and were interviewed again. The assessments addressed the participant&#8217;s current circumstances, and what had happened for them over the last ten years. The interviews also asked the participants to reflect about 12 resilience dimensions that have been identified in the literature (Masten &amp; Coatsworth, 1998) and whether they considered that they were personally resilient. The recent interview data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith &amp; Osborn, 2008). The individual analyses show a rich diversity of life paths and, as well, three sets of themes were identified across the case studies; and they are personal relationships, contexts of development (schooling and education, culture, religion, and jobs and careers), and personhood and identity. A resilience model was derived from the integration of the data from the first and second assessments with contemporary resilience studies and theorising. The central idea of the model is that resilient functioning is determined by the nature and quality of relationships within, and across, developmental settings. As a corollary, it is hypothesised that interpersonal relationships influence individual executive functioning, and emotional regulation in particular; and that these cognitive and affective capacities can translate into goal seeking and other constructive actions. The explanation of the resilience model leads onto recommendations for further research on relationships that enhance personal functioning. There are also suggestions for social policy that follow from the exposition, and some guidelines for professional practice with children and families.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Longitudinal study</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wind-hydrogen energy systems for remote area power supply</field><field name="creator">Janon, Akraphon</field><field name="description">Wind-hydrogen systems for remote area power supply are an early niche application of sustainable hydrogen energy. Optimal direct coupling between a wind turbine and an electrolyser stack is essential for maximum electrical energy transfer and hydrogen production. In addition, system costs need to be minimised if wind-hydrogen systems are to become competitive. This paper investigates achieving near maximum power transfer between a fixed pitched variable-speed wind turbine and a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser without the need for intervening voltage converters and maximum power point tracking electronics. The approach investigated involves direct coupling of the wind turbine with suitably configured generator coils to an optimal series-parallel configuration of PEM electrolyser cells so that the I-V characteristics of both the wind turbine and electrolyser stack are closely matched for maximum power transfer.  A procedure for finding these optimal con figurations and hence maximising hydrogen production from the system is described. For the case of an Air 403 400 W wind turbine located at a typical coastal site in south-eastern Australia and directly coupled to an optimally configured 400 W stack of PEM electrolysers, it is estimated that up to 95% of the maximum achievable energy can be transferred to the electrolyser over an annual period. The results of an extended experiment to test this theoretical prediction for an actual Air 403 wind turbine are reported.  The implications of optimal coupling between a PEM electrolyser and an aerogenerator for the performance and overall economics of wind-energy hydrogen systems for RAPS applications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">PEM electrolysers</field><field name="subject">direct coupling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.094605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of new processes and products for knitted textiles: this research will explore the combination of standard and non-standard fibres and finishing processes to create three-dimensional and sculptural knitted fabric structures, while expanding the potential of domestic machine knitting to be viewed as an art form.</field><field name="creator">Paleologos, Esther</field><field name="description">Contemporary knitting over the past decade has experienced a recent resurgence in cultural interest and technical exploration. This research project aims to identify, through personal practice, the implications of knitting as undefined, removed from the boundaries of product. It is the dissolving of the lines between design, art and craft and exploring the domestically machine knitted textile via the use of materials and the inherent qualities of the fabric which are the driving factors of this research. It is through this exploration that my personal and creative process is diversified.      The traditional connotations of knitting are historical, social and cultural, in particular hand knitting. Childhood memories of mothers and grandmothers knitting out of necessity, for clothing, often evoke feelings of safety, warmth and comfort. This familiarity of the looped stitches and understanding of the knit as garment binds knitting to fashion. Industrial knitting process, as scale of stitch is reduced, begins to remove this familiarity and creates an anonymity of structure and process, for example jersey knits used for t-shirts.  This instant recognition for knitting as clothing is part of the design process where-by knitted fabrics work in unison with product. It is this boundary that has defined my professional practice designing for knitwear. This research involves a more experimental and fluid approach to producing the textile, considering the qualities and potential of the structure as something to celebrate in its own form.      Designers such as Issey Miyake, Hussein Chalayan and the artist Rosmarie Trockel have been influential in taking fashion concepts into the gallery, often knitted. This movement of making conceptual and political statements, especially in the case of the industrially knitted pieces by Trockel, was a step to question the traditional and feminist perceptions of knitting and using the process as a material to create art.  While these exhibitions explored the knitted textile in the form of fashion garment, the importance of diversifying the knitted cloth and displaying conceptual pieces is a major influence on this research. Also the more recent exhibition 'Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting', (Museum of Arts &amp; Design New York 2007), has allowed for a reinvigorated forum for constructed textiles to be viewed as object, new product or purely as spatial explorations of structure. The impact of these ideas has allowed for the consideration of the textile being stripped back further and to remove the instant connot ation of product application.      Exploration of materials, knitted structures and the manipulation of fabric without the constraints of identified product is the impetus of this project. The evolution of the outcomes is instrumental to the reactions of fibres, stitch and interplays of positive and negative space, while suggestions of product are accidental and created by the knitted form as it is removed from the machine. A personal interest in exploiting the knitted structures potential to possess transparency and opacity, become sculptural and changeable by hand have influenced the choices of material and stitch combination. This experimentation has informed my personal practice and the involved process of making.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Domestic knitting</field><field name="subject">Contemporary knitting</field><field name="subject">Textile design</field><field name="subject">Knitted textile</field><field name="subject">Knitted art</field><field name="subject">Knitted craft</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.143129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins, procedure and artefact</field><field name="creator">Shukuroglou, Vicky</field><field name="description">Found and collected natural (organic) and industrial materials are conducive to Vicky Shukuroglou's making of artefacts. They have particular properties of materiality and origin for engagement, interpretation and intervention. Materials are sourced, selected and collected from such diverse environments as urban industries and remote coastal environs. They are chosen for their working properties, personal associations, and qualities such as colour, form, texture, weight, structure and material composition. Her observations of and responses to these diverse environments and their local materials become the influence in the process of making.    Objects - such as hair and bone - are investigated and reflected upon as they hold certain qualities that appeal and intrigue, and inspire creative responses. Materials are significantly altered from their original form and utilised for the construction of works, or engaged with as 'objects' for inclusion that remain largely as they were found. They are built onto, extended, reconstructed, enclosed or joined with the constructed elements. Visual energy and ambiguity created from common and opposing qualities is considered and utilised in the interpretation of found forms. In the building of these objects or assemblages, they take on a detailed and intimate identity, whose scale expands beyond the hand held object.       The process and activity of making is a vehicle for further observation and learning, generating an understanding and insight into the relationships of place, structure, form, movement, space, and personal methodologies.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Process</field><field name="subject">found objects</field><field name="subject">structure</field><field name="subject">object</field><field name="subject">working properties</field><field name="subject">contemporary art</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Brazil</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.154248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building mobile L2TP/IPsec tunnels</field><field name="creator">Xu, Chen</field><field name="description">Wireless networks introduce a whole range of challenges to the traditional TCP/IP network, especially Virtual Private Network (VPN). Changing IP address is a difficult issue for VPNs in wireless networks because IP addresses are used as one of the identifiers of a VPN connection and the change of IP addresses will break the original connection. The current solution to this problem is to run VPN tunnels over Mobile IP (MIP). However, Mobile IP itself has significant problems in performance and security and that solution is inefficient due to double tunneling.       This thesis proposes and implements a new and novel solution on simulators and real devices to solve the mobility problem in a VPN. The new solution adds mobility support to existing L2TP/IPsec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol/IP Security) tunnels. The new solution tunnels Layer 2 packets between VPN clients and a VPN server without using Mobile IP, without incurring tunnel-re-establishment at handoff, without losing packets during handoff, achieves better security than current mobility solutions for VPN, and supports fast handoff in IPv4 networks.    Experimental results on a VMware simulation showed the handoff time for the VPN tunnel to be 0.08 seconds, much better than the current method which requires a new tunnel establishment at a cost of 1.56 seconds.       Experimental results with a real network of computers showed the handoff time for the VPN tunnel to be 4.8 seconds. This delay was mainly caused by getting an IP address from DHCP servers via wireless access points (4.6 seconds). The time for VPN negotiation was only 0.2 seconds. The experimental result proves that the proposed mobility solution greatly reduces the VPN negotiation time but getting an IP address from DHCP servers is a large delay which obstructs the real world application. This problem can be solved by introducing fast DHCP or supplying an IP address from a new wireless access point with a strong signal while the current Internet connection is weak. Currently, there is little work on fast DHCP and this may open a range of new research opportunities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VPN</field><field name="subject">IPsec</field><field name="subject">L2TP</field><field name="subject">PPP</field><field name="subject">Mobile IP</field><field name="subject">VMware</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.160455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable housing and outcomes of the Cairnlea ecohome</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Syed Mohammad Shafiqur</field><field name="description">The effect of global warming is a growing concern for the global community. This concern is reflected in politics, business, corporate charters, local government charters, electronic and print media and so on. The core to this issue is green house gas (GHG) emissions due to anthropogenic activities. In a developed country such as Australia, residential green house gas emissions are responsible for about 20% of its total GHG emissions. Therefore, sustainability in the housing sector is important towards overall reduction of GHG emissions.      Australia's progress in sustainable housing is discussed. There are legislation and financial incentives towards sustainable housing. All the states and territories and the Commonwealth provide financial incentives for PV energy, rain water tank, solar hot water systems to supplement high initial set up cost. A number of high quality rating tools are developed in Australia to facilitate and administer energy efficient design for residential and commercial buildings. There are many good examples of sustainable housing throughout Australia.      The Ecohome at Cairnlea, Melbourne is a demonstration home as well as part of this research project. This standard home added with 'off the shelf' sustainable features and having a FirstRate star rating of 6 stars is intended for the volume home market. This thesis presents sustainability outcomes of the Ecohome.        Thermal performance of the Ecohome is presented qualitatively and quantitatively. Monitoring data from 14 months' show that approximately two-thirds of the time, indoor temperatures remained in comfort zone (18-26 C) without artificial heating or cooling. Monitoring of indoor air quality included carbon dioxide, humidity and carbon monoxide. Monitoring data from sealed house and while the residents were living in are presented. Humidity level was within 35-45% most of the time while carbon dioxide was under recommended level (1080ppm) in the lower floor (living area and kitchen). Carbon monoxide level within the house was negligible. Significant energy and water savings were realised in the Ecohome. On per capita basis, 45% savings in water usage, 30% savings in electricity usage while similar gas usage was observed compared to average Melbourne home. Residents' feedback on sustainable features was mostly positive (except sisal carpet).      Several thermal performance indicators are proposed and presented. These include 'Attenuation Factor', 'Time Lag', 'Heating and Cooling Need' in degree hours, 'Degree C Warmer' and 'Percentage Time in Comfort Zone'. Some of these concepts were used by some authors with different nomenclature; therefore, an attempt was made to unify them. Monitoring data was utilized to measure thermal performance of the Ecohome using these indicators.       Prediction of indoor temperature when outside temperature is known is of much interest. Statistical and empirical methods were employed for this purpose. Both statistical method and Givoni method produce reasonably good prediction with deviations from actual observations being in the range of 2 to 3 deg C.      This research provides valuable monitoring results in this emerging field. Proposed thermal performance indicators are a significant contribution to the body of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecohome</field><field name="subject">Sustainable housing</field><field name="subject">thermal performance</field><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">indicators</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.164750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bridging the divide between resource management and everyday life: smart metering, comfort and cleanliness</field><field name="creator">Strengers, Yolande Amy-Adeline</field><field name="description">Smart metering residential demand management programs, such as consumption feedback, variable pricing regimes and the remote control of appliances, are being used to respond to the resource management problems of peak electricity demand, climate change and water shortages. Like other demand management programs, these strategies fail to account for (and respond to) the reasons why people consume resources in their homes, namely to carry out everyday practices such as bathing, laundering, heating and cooling. In particular, comfort and cleanliness practices together constitute most of Australia's potable water consumption in urban centres, and represent most of household energy consumption. In addition, new household cooling practices involving air-conditioning appliances are the major contributor to the nation's rising peak electricity demand, which overloads the electricity system on hot days, costing consumers millions of dollars each year. The oversight of comf ort and cleanliness practices in smart metering demand management programs is concerning because these practices are continuing to shift and change, often in more resource-consuming directions, potentially negating the resource savings achieved through demand management programs.       This thesis aims to bridge the problematic divide between the policies and strategies of demand managers, and the day-to-day practices which constitute everyday life. Using the empirical 'hook' of smart metering demand management programs and the everyday practices of comfort and cleanliness, this thesis develops a practice-based conceptual framework to study, understand and analyse these practices and the ways in which smart metering demand management programs reconfigure or further entrench them.       A series of qualitative methods were employed in studying 65 households across four research groups, focusing specifically on the household practices of heating, cooling, bathing, laundering, toilet flushing and house cleaning. In addition, 27 interviews were conducted with smart metering industry stakeholders involved or implicated in delivering demand management strategies. Together, these lines of inquiry are used to analyse householders' existing and changing comfort and cleanliness practices, the role of several smart metering demand management strategies in reconfiguring these practices, and potential avenues and opportunities for further practice change in less resource-intensive directions. In particular, this thesis highlights the inherent contradictions and problems in accounting for everyday practices within the dominant demand management paradigm, and offers an alternative paradigm termed the co-management of everyday practices. The thesis concludes by briefly identifying the ways in which smart  metering could potentially constrain or catalyse a transition towards this new paradigm.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart metering</field><field name="subject">thermal comfort</field><field name="subject">cleanliness</field><field name="subject">demand management</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="subject">social practices</field><field name="subject">households</field><field name="subject">everyday life</field><field name="subject">consumption feedback</field><field name="subject">dynamic peak pricing</field><field name="subject">variable pricing regimes</field><field name="subject">peak demand</field><field name="subject">in-home displays</field><field name="subject">co-management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100329.165839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward public management by enhancing public sector strategic planning : using private sector planning techniques to improve public sector planning</field><field name="creator">Wills, Juilinne Anton</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problems associated with the Australian Public Sector moving
sometimes erratically towards strategic public management following substantial and

philosophies and methodologies have already and could be applied more relevantly to the
public sector. The major proposition is that commercial planning methods and techniques
can be used selectively to enhance agency planning and management effectiveness and
efficiency. A specific application at Centrelink is considered for public service providers
delivering high quality government services as part of a purchaser/provider relationship.
Strategic planning and management theory and models are reviewed and a progressivestages
model is developed for the APS. A range of private sector planning techniques and
tools is evaluated and brief but classified case studies on major APS organizations are
also presented. The thesis concludes that a dynamics capabilities approach would enable

Strippers manipulate mens desires and fantasies and parody, through their routine, the male in the act of sex.

The canal, named Klong Om-Klong Bangkok Noi-Klong Bang Kruai, is utilised for agriculture, transportation, commerce, tourism and aesthetics. Currently, urbanisation threatens the canal through changes in land use along the canal.

Globalization has resulted in many organizations experiencing market pressures to foster a fundamental rethink of the way business is conducted. It is no longer possible for an organization to only focus on its individual operation in order to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. It is now recognized that the success of the individual organization if dependent, to a large extent, on the performance and reliability of its suppliers and customers. Customers now want a wide range of options where they can configure products in accordance with their unique specifications. Hence, logisitics and supply chain management has been introduced as an alternative strategy for businesses in global competition to meet their customers' rapidly changing requirements.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automobile industry and trade</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing industries</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82946</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Malaysian food service organisations and transaction cost /</field><field name="creator">Lok, Stanley Yap Peng.</field><field name="description">These research papers propose transaction cost economice (TCE) to investigate Malaysian food service organisations .</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food industry and trade</field><field name="subject">Food service management</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83046</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecotourism :</field><field name="creator">Prapannetivuth, Anyapak.</field><field name="description">Ecotourism is a form of travel which minimizes the negative impact of tourism on local communities and environments.

While adaptive processing is important for other types of sensors, including airborne radars, HF radar systems are particularly well-suited to its application, given the modern digital receiver-per-element arrays and radar facilities able to host large computational resources.

The equilibrium capillary pressure technique (ECP) consists in measuring the pressure required to prevent liquid penetration into a packed bed of particles and calculating the contact angle from a simple model, namely the equilavent capillary model. The ECP is well suited for the measurement of advancing contact angles. In its most convenient version the capillary pressure is measured for two different liquids (one of which is fully wetting and thus allows the calculation of the effective capillary radius). The use ECP to obtain the receding contact angle on powders has been developed. The major difference bertween a liquid penetrating a porous bed and retreating from it is that liquid pockets are left behind in the receding case. Effectively, this reduces the porosity of the packed bed. The volume fraction of the retained liquid apparently depends on the surface tension of the liquid but is only marginally affected by the wettability and size fraction of the particles. Therefore a simple procedure for the determination of the receding contact angle, based on the use of a calibrating liquid, is outlined and verified. The approach gives realistic values for the receding contact angle.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wetting</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Liquid-liquid interfaces.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83031</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Titania pigment surface modification for improved plastic dispersion /</field><field name="creator">Capelle, Hendrik A.</field><field name="description">In this study a variety of surface modifiers were absorbed onto titania pigment and their interaction examined.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Titania (Chemical)</field><field name="subject">Pigments.</field><field name="subject">Plastics</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82994</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing young children's engagement in musical activities : a cross-cultural study</field><field name="creator">Yim, Hoi Yin Bonnie</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to examine developmental, parental and pedagogical factors influencing young children's (aged 4-5 years) engagement levels in group musical activities in child care centres.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Day care centers</field><field name="subject">Day care centers</field><field name="subject">Music and children</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83071</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic knowledge management : manging dynamic knowledge and small-worlds social networks</field><field name="creator">Sastrowardoyo, Saraswati</field><field name="description">This thesis examines knowledge management from a social networking perspective, arguing that knowledge, as a social construct, has at its basis, people; and their interaction with one another.

This thesis makes some preliminary enquiries into these new logics, the new 'selectors' at work in human meaning making ecosystems that owe little to those produced by billions of years of 'natural selection'. What seems to be at work at present is an enormously accelerated 'cultural selection' of winners and losers in the 'real' and 'imaginary' world. It would be unwise for the modernist systems of thought that still inform many of our institutional responses to the biosphere to ignore the pre-eminent affect of these cultural processes and the strange and possibly disturbing (at least to the ecosystemic biological purists) new 'weedy' entertainment-ecosystems that might arise from their deployment.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human ecology</field><field name="subject">Environmentalism</field><field name="subject">Political ecology.</field><field name="subject">Social ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79329</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of biological and chemically induced leaching mechanisms of chalcopyrite</field><field name="creator">Absolon, Victor John.</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 2008.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chalcopyrite</field><field name="subject">Leaching.</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79352</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spirituality approach to organization transformation /</field><field name="creator">Seah, David Jeremiah.</field><field name="description">This research presents a qualitative case study based on grounded theory to address the research question: What can harness and release the subconscious creative potentials of people multi-individuals for responsible organizational transformation of a church?

High rate codes are necessary for applications which require high bandwidth efficiency, like high data rate communication systems and magnet recording systems. Convolutional ( rate k/n) codes, used as component codes for turbo codes, are preferred for their regular trellis structure and the resulting ease in decoding. However, the branch complexity of the (primal) code trellis increases exponentially with 'k' for k/(k+1) codes, making decoding on the code trellis quickly impractical with increasing code rate. 'Puncturing' is the method traditionally used for generating high rate codes, which keeps the decoding complexity nearly the same for a wide range of code rates, since the same 'mother' code decoder is used at the receiver, while only the puncturing and depuncturing pattern is altered for changes in code rate. However, 'puncturing' puts a constraint in the search for the best possible high rate code, thereby resulting in a performance penalty, particularly at high SNRs.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coding theory</field><field name="subject">Decoders (Electronics)</field><field name="subject">Digital communications</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79317</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance contracting in hospital facilities management context /</field><field name="creator">Chan, Eric Kui Sing.</field><field name="description">The central feature of energy saving performance contracting (ESPC) in Hong Kong in the past decade has been the introduction of a new concept of energy management through a performance-based competitive approach applied in hospitals.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals</field><field name="subject">Health facilities</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79508</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dead cells :</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Robert J.</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns collecting, an activity that, although widespread, is often misunderstood; an activity that is frequently treated with mild amusement as the harmless province of ecentrics, and, more seriously, as an antisocial or even an unhealthy pursuit.

The research takes place around two related enquiries. The first emerges from questions raised by the art critic Rosalyn Deutsche in regard to the proposition that public art functions as both a profession and technology that attempts to pattern space 'so that docile and useful bodies are created by and deployed within it'. Following such questions, this thesis seeks to scrutinise the ways in which discourses on public art might also operate in enabling, maintaining or even disrupting everyday practices and socio-spatial relations. Secondly, as a foray into methodologies of public art research, the thesis considers Foucauldian 'governmentality' approaches in terms of what these might have to offer an investigation of public art.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public art</field><field name="subject">Public spaces</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79322</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a novel optical contact probing system for nano-CMM /</field><field name="creator">Ji, Hong.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and the verification of a novel micro probe system for high accurancy downscaled Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coordinate measuring machines.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79344</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relational market based assets (of a firm) and their role in innovation adoption /</field><field name="creator">Belder, Marcus.</field><field name="description">This thesis identifies the positive effect that relational Market Based Assets have on the adoption of innovation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New products</field><field name="subject">Product management.</field><field name="subject">Marketing research.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79481</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of human resource factors on employee attitudes and environmental performance in a sample of Malaysian ISO 14001 EMS certified companies /</field><field name="creator">Kaur, Harjeet.</field><field name="description">Despite the considerable existing body of academic literature, increasing employee motivation for environmental endeavors continues to be poorly understood. Recently Govindarajulu and Daily (2004) presented a comprehensive theoretical framework for environmental performance by looking at the crucial employer and employee factors affecting environmental performance. The authors identified management commitment, employee empowerment, feedback and review, and rewards as key human resource (HR) factors in increasing employee motivation for enhanced environmental performance. However, no published studies to date have empirically validated the framework. Therefore, one purpose of this dissertation is to address this void. Additionally, job satisfaction and organizational commitment were proposed as mediators in the relationship between the HR factors and environmental performance.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ISO 14000 Series Standards.</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="subject">Environmental protection</field><field name="subject">Employee attitude surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79544</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the extent to which career development impacts employee commitment :</field><field name="creator">Chui, Joseph.</field><field name="description">This study attempts to validate the generalizability of Wang's five-component commitment model among 300 ICT professionals in Hong Kong.

Measument perspectives are usually related to the performance of important aspects in a partnering project and key factors contributing to a project's success. The results indicate that there are significant differences within the important aspects and differences among the important aspects with respect to their performances in a partnering project. Practitioners review timely completion as the most important aspect and under-perform. Evaluation of key factors from the four categories contributing to the performance of a partnering project was undertaken. Results indicate that process is the most significant category. These papers intend to explore the important aspects as performance indicators of a successful partnering project and identify key factors contributing to the performance of a partnering project.

An attempt is made to enhance the existing market orientation theory by addressing a research gap and highlighting the importance of the relationship perspective in business to business marketing. A four dimensional market orientation construct is developed to overcome the limitations identified in the extant market orientation theories. The study also identifies resource availability as an antecedent of market orientation along with six other antecedents which are commonly discussed in literature. It further investigates whether the market orientation-business performance relationship is moderated by the prevailing business environment. The proposed modifications to the theory are empirically tested within the context of the apparel industry.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field

Determining the future of the disputed areas of northern Iraq is the main reason behind this Kurdish involvement and it is one of the two Kurdish objectives in Iraq. The other is the quest to establish an independent state of Kurdistan. The relations between the two objectives are particularly complicated, as are the Iraqi and Kurdish issues. On the one hand it is difficult to imagine that the Kurds will declare an independent state without Kirkuk, or if they do so it is unclear how that state could be economically viable. On the other hand, it is hard for the Kurds to convince others to help solve the sensitive issue of Kirkuk if they assert their claim for independence. In other words, control of Kirkuk and independence are inseparable elements of the Kurdish strategy, but the former will guarantee the success of a Kurdish state whereas asserting independence would jeopardise the control of Kirkuk if it was the Kurds declared strategy in the present situation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kurds</field><field name="subject">Kurds</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80706</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a kinetic model to support control decisions in a chloraminated distribution system /</field><field name="creator">Gnos, Gregory</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEngineering(HydrologyWaterRes))--University of South Australia, 2007.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chloramines.</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80796</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic planning in "Enterprise 50" companies and other SMEs in Malaysia /</field><field name="creator">Seong, Wong Kim.</field><field name="description">Thesis (DBusinessAdministration)--University of South Australia, 2007.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80836</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mara Salvatrucha and transnational crime in North and Central America :</field><field name="creator">Alcantara, Mariana Del Rocio</field><field name="description">Thesis (MInternationalStudies)--University of South Australia, 2007.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mara Salvatrucha.</field><field name="subject">Organized crime</field><field name="subject">Transnational crime.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80750</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fine particle flotation /</field><field name="creator">Miettinen, Tatu.</field><field name="description">The recovery of fine particles has become of great importance during recent years, since the demand for minerals is increasing and the extent of available ore is decreasing.

Organic certification is used globally to guarantee that organic labelled producers follow the principles and standards of organic agriculture set by international and national organic certification bodies. Currently the lengthy and complex process of organic certification is entirely paper based, requires organic primary producers to have access to the certifying body, and involves precise data capture and transfer over a long period of time. The paper based organic certification process has some significant disadvantages such as being time-consuming, error-prone (particularly transcription errors) and complex. Any improvement of the paper based organic paper certification process can lead to higher efficiency, lower costs and time savings for primary producers and certifying bodies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile commerce</field><field name="subject">Rural telecommunication</field><field name="subject">Diffusion of innovations</field><field name="subject">Natural foods</field><field name="subject">Organic farming</field><field name="subject">Agriculture</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80712</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an agile management framework based on the theory of constraints /</field><field name="creator">Ifandoudas, Panayiotis.</field><field name="description">The research is aimed at furthering knowledge in the research fields of management accounting, operations management, performance measurement, and management strategy.

Traditionally, MANETs are assumed to be stand-alone networks which do not require assistance from fixed network infrastructure (e.g. a backbone network). Based on this assumption, routing protocols for MANETs have been designed to work in stand-alone mode. However, throughput and coverage requirements of future 4G all-IP systems may require integration of MANETs into these systems to enhance the flexibility and pervasiveness of the networks. The coverage of existing infrastructure networks (wireless LAN hot-spots of 3G networks) can be effectively extended by the relaying communications via ad hot network nodes (wireless routers). Also, the limited services available within MANET can be extended to a wider range through connecting of the MANET to the Internet infrastructure. To achieve this, effective solutions are needed to many existing challenges in integrating MANETs with the Internet.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication).</field><field name="subject">Ad hoc networks (Computer networks).</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80683</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription pharmaceuticals :</field><field name="creator">Ng, Chor Shan Sian.</field><field name="description">Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription products is the promotion of prescription-only medicine (POM) to the general public through commercial media.

Many of today's so-called industrial economies will be dwarfed by emerging markets due to the latter's faster economic growth rates. China is by far the most important emerging market, but as a result of its relatively recent opening to western investment, its vastness, diversity and its distinct culture, among other factors, it has been a particularly troublesome market for western companies to enter and succeed in. Companies wishing to invest in China have arguably not been particularly helped by the corporate strategy literature. This literature has been, to a great extent developed upon evidence derived from developed countries which may not relevant for the very different business terrain and context of emerging markets. Moreover, the China strategy literature has tended until recently to focus on the joint venture vehicle as corporate strategy and with much of this literature producing unclear or conflicting findings.

There remains a gap in this approach to dynamics that is academically and managerially relevant. The growth of a particular brand immediately implies a change in the market of some sort and that means the double jeopardy line is likely to move.

Spatial changes are needed to make a city such as Adelaide less car-dependent towards a city that relies on more sustainable transport modes for its day to day urban travel needs. On the other hand, to date, the impacts of local urban form on travel behaviour have not been adequately investigated through empirical research in Australia. The importance of research on this matter rises from the institutional and academic efforts to modify the growing car-dependent lifestyle in Australian cities through spatial planning and quality design. This thesis presents the results from a comparative study of travel patterns among residents of four suburban residential areas in metropolitan Adelaide. Using existing datasets together with inventory data of urban environment characteristics from original fieldwork, this research examines to what extent there are associations between various attributes of a particular urban location as they relate to travel behaviour and household socio-economics. The findings derived from quantitative and qualitative methods suggest that urban form/design must be taken into consideration in policy making for mobility reduction. Well-connected streets, and close proximity to jobs and key functions were shown to induce non-motorised travel. From an urban design and planning policy perspective, this suggests that greater daily activity and consequent health and environmental benefits might accrue from designing human-scale, walkable communities that appeal to the preference of different social groups versus investment in master-planned communities in the hope of swaying travel behaviour. That is, pedestrian-friendly places suited to the taste preferences of socio-demographic groups might induce more physical activity over the long run through the process of residential self-selection than overt efforts to create fully planned, attractive and quality landscapes all over suburbia.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="subject">Transportation</field><field name="subject">Choice of transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78857</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing polymer adsorption at the solid-liquid interface with particle film ATR-FTIR spectroscopy /</field><field name="creator">Cuba-Chiem, Linh.</field><field name="description">Polymeric depressant adsorption on the surface of talc was investigated using in situ Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy.

The OIS industry is the highest growth area in the current service revolution (Santos 2003). However, the many efforts so far in the industry for developing innovative OISs have largely failed to attract audiences and frustrated the attempts to generate revenue from subscriptions and advertising (Alves 2001; Sullivan 2006). Researchers face great challenge in applying conventional wisdom from information system (IS) research to analyse OISs. Bobbitt and Dabholkar (2001) and Santos (2003) argued that there is no comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding or predicting consumers' online adoption behaviour.

The aim of this research is to explore the processes and key success factors by comparing two different types of partnership networks. The "Five-Cs" conceptual framework is used to investigate and test the given partnership networks. The Five-Cs are consciousness, contention, connectivity, constitution and continuity. A number of key aspects and success factors related to forming partnership networks at different formation stages are examined.

There is a high staff turnover, and additionally, it is costly to train new employees and to get them "up to speed" with the same level of ability as those who have resigned. In this context, this study seeks to examine the relationship between the current Human Resource Management (HRM) practices and the macro-environmental factors in this sector of the Thai construction business in order to assess their impact upon HRM outcomes. Four propositions are presented on the relationship between HRM practices, macro-environmental factors, and the HRM outcomes. This study comprised two major phases. Prior to conducting in-depth interviews with seventy two individuals from twenty four construction firms, five case studies were conducted involving interviews with five senior managers from five major construction businesses in Thailand to explore specific variables relative to HRM practices and HRM outcomes. A qualitative methodology was employed through semi-structured interviews questions.

The first three factors constitute the independent variables, and the last one, the dependent variable. For further understanding of these factors, the independent variables were each additionally split into related elements. The first variable - organisational commitment to employment of disabled people - consists of two elements: recruitment of disabled people, and employee training for disability-related issues. The second variable - attitude towards disabled workers - is composed of three elements: co-workers perception of disabled workers, managements perception of work attendance of disabled workers, and managements perception on the need for supervision. The third variable - organisational policy on disability - is composed of only one element which is the organisational policies on the employment of disabled people. Overall, these three independent variables significantly explain the variance in the dependent variable, i.e. employment opportunities for disabled persons.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with disabilities</field><field name="subject">Organizational commitment.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78821</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business process outsourcing relationships in Swiss banking :</field><field name="creator">Seidl, Roman.</field><field name="description">The outsourcing market, especially Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), is growing every year.

Given the nature of the topic but also because of practical constraints, the investigator elected to use a qualitative, interpretative, social constructionist research framework. An extensive review of the literature revealed that a variety of definitions of in- and out-sourcing exist.

There are many aspects in the manufacture of a DNA chip and each serves as a contributing variable to the overall performance of the device. Commercial production of microarrays commenced before a basic understanding of the physical and chemical processes that govern the many variables was attained and the role of each on the performance of microarrays was understood. The consequence of this has been non-optimal performance of this technology and variable results from microarray analyses. Recent studies have shown that part of the variability in the use of commercially available microarrays relates to insufficient control of the surface chemistry within a microarray spot and between spots. Although the ideal characteristics of a microarray surface have been identified, existing surfaces and the ongoing proliferation of alternative ones do not address these sufficiently in order to reduce the sources of error arising from the surface of a microarray. Hence, the application of physico-chemical techniques in the development of microarrays surfaces can assist in improving the performance of these devices.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immobilized nucleic acids.</field><field name="subject">Plasma polymerization.</field><field name="subject">DNA microarrays.</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78871</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an agent-based architecture for virtual CIM /</field><field name="creator">Wang, Dongsheng.</field><field name="description">Today's manufacturers tend to use integrated manufacturing systems in order to achieve the capability to quickly respond to customer's requirements and produce high quality products in the shortest possible time and at the lowest possible cost.

By implementation it is meant those actions by the firm after the decision to adopt the new system has been taken, including the adaptation of existing routines to support the new equipment or processes.

Since Salovey and Mayer's (1990) seminal article on the concept, and its popularisation in a social science book of the same name (Gibbs 1995; Goleman 1995), emotional intelligence has emerged in several different models and measures. Matthews et al. (2002) outlined three contexts for the study of emotional intelligence: psychometric, theoretical, and applied. The focus of this study is on measurement and applied use of emotional intelligence; where the &#8220;underlying EI is the impetus to improve emotional functioning in real life&#8221; (Matthews et al. 2002, p. 27). To the author's knowledge, no independent studies have measured the emotional intelligence of managers in Singapore.

Traditionally, such moments have not been considered worthy of documentation and have been omitted or overlooked by mainstream media. This exegesis examines the importance of the everyday and considers how to make it conspicuous. Historically, these moments have been identified with the feminine, in that much theoretical and artistic work has emerged exploring women's experience of the everyday and testifying to its importance. Three spheres in particular have attracted critical interest: namely the body, the domestic and personal identity. For example, in 1966 Yoko Ono's 'No 4 (Bottoms)' brought the issue of the body and its banality onto centre stage by showing an endless parade of bottoms. In 1975, Chantal Akerman's film 'Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles', showed the everyday routines of a self-contained housewife. More recently, numerous artists have explored the politics of identity. Sadie Benning has made numerous videos that show the mundane and also reveal her personal identity, by exploring large and especially small scale details.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video art.</field><field name="subject">Experimental videos.</field><field name="subject">Feminism and art.</field><field name="subject">Human beings in art.</field><field name="subject">Identity (Psychology) in art.</field><field name="subject">Feminism in art.</field><field name="subject">Sex in art.</field><field name="subject">Diseases in art.</field><field name="subject">Performance art.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78960</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antibiotic resistance in staphylococci associated with cats and dogs /</field><field name="creator">Malik, Seidu.</field><field name="description">Staphylococci are important opportunistic pathogens often found in the microflora of skin and mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract of man and animals.

Research related to environmental management in the Taiwan food service industry is still very limited. This research aims to study how corporate (head office) level decision makers in the food service chains recognize the impact of environmental issue on their business, and what factors might influence them putting this issue into firms' strategic plans. A series of questions have been developed based on the literature and the conceptual framework in order to gain an understanding on how the motivating factors can influence food service operators towards implementing environmental strategies. A questionnaire survey complemented by interviews was used to assess the influence of public concern, government's environmental policy, competitive advantage, top management commitment, firm's capability, and environmental orientation on environmental strategies in food service chains. For the survey study, 133 Taiwan food service franchisors who are on the registration list of the Taiwan Chain Store and Franchise Association (TCFA) were purposely chosen. The data obtained from the survey provided a wide-ranging exploration of what is happening overall in the food service chain regarding environmental strategies and the attitudes and perceptions towards motivating antecedents. Furthermore, the survey provided an opportunity to identify a pioneering company for the further in-depth case study in which each of the motivating factors and environmental strategies were studied in more detail, and the associated relationships between them and the key motivating factors were able to be determined.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food industry and trade</field><field name="subject">Hospitality industry</field><field name="subject">Food service</field><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80438</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between store image and customer satisfaction in chain convenience store : a study in Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Cheng Fang</field><field name="description">Store image and customer satisfaction become increasingly important factors in modern retailing - a market characterized by fast growth and intense competition. 7-11, Taiwan; Family-Mart and Hi-Life are already present as the top three in Taiwan retail market.

They believed that women managers will benefit from the training programs because women managers will develop their managerial skills to help them balance their work and family more professionally. Supportive development programs were offered to all women managers such as time management skills, coaching, mentoring, English language training, and team work. This is important because all organisations need to encourage their very best women managers to stay rather than quit to other careers.

Although in the preliminary stages of research, the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) (Storey, Rowland, Conforti, &amp; Dickson, 2004) has recently shown promise. It obtains high sensitivities and specificities, does not appear susceptible to the effects of translation, and appears applicable in a multicultural setting. Therefore; the aim of the current research was to examine further the performance of the RUDAS in an ethnolinguistically diverse sample. Archival data consisting of scores on the RUDAS and on a comprehensive test battery was gathered from 64 neuropsychological referrals to an Australian health service from 2002-2006. The majority (83%) of these referrals were from a non-English speaking background and were tested in their preferred language. The RUDAS was found to be a fairly cohesive measure, and domain subscales were strongly correlated with corresponding scores on other neuropsychological tests indicating accurate performance. Although moderately predictive of diagnoses of dementia and cognitive decline (obtaining sensitivities of 71% and 62% respectively) the RUDAS lacked specificity, a finding which may be attributed to the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in the sample. The RUDAS fullscale score was found resilient to age, gender, English language proficiency and education effects; however subscale scores were differentially affected, perhaps indicating a tendency towards bias. Overall, this study suggests that the RUDAS is a useful screening instrument in an ethnolinguistically diverse clinical population.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Older Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80398</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy of an intensive early intervention program for young children with autistic disorder /</field><field name="creator">Morrell, Tracy.</field><field name="description">The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Early Intervention Research program (EIRP) for children with Autistic Disorder (AD) at the Flinders University of South Australia.

In this study, several methods were used to reduce copper activation of pyrite during grinding or to minimise its effect on the flotation of pyrite at pH 9.0.

BMT patients (n=20) completed standardized measures of physical and emotional distress related to their illness, the impact the illness was having on their life, anxiety and depression. Patient satisfaction with the doctor was assessed, as were doctor impressions of patient distress and behaviour during the consult. Results indicated that patient distress was best represented by the physical and emotional impact it was having on the patient's life. Overall, doctors had difficulty accurately assessing distress levels in their patients. Interpretation of multiple regression analysis revealed that doctor perception of patient behaviour was predicted more highly by patient distress levels than patient satisfaction. Due to the continual restrictions in doctors accurately assessing distress during medical consultations this research suggests that further studies are needed, in particular regarding the use of direct questioning or brief screening measures to assist doctors with the identification of distress.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone marrow</field><field name="subject">Physician and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80399</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescent identity development /</field><field name="creator">Raymond, Ivan.</field><field name="description">Despite wider community appeal, there has been restricted interest within the psychological discipline to understand and utilise the 'rites of passage' paradigm.

An additional important refinement on previous work included the adoption of a theoretically driven approach to calculate post-test change scores (Standardized Based Regression) in order to control measurement error, practice effects and regression-to-the-mean. A further important refinement included the analysis of different subtypes of depression and how they affect patient perceptions of memory over time. A prospective study of 64 elective CABG surgery patients (mean age 65.4 years) was undertaken pre-operatively and six months post-operatively, along with the assessment of 50 normal control participants (mean age 68.6 years). The neuropsychological test battery was selected in accordance with the Statement of Consensus on the Assessment of Neurobehavioural Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery (Murkin et al., 1995). Standardized self-report measures of depression and memory self-report were also included, namely the DASS and MAC-S. Unexpectedly, results showed that both CABG patients and controls scored in the 'normal' range for depression at both testing intervals. However, at baseline assessment, analyses showed small, significant correlations between memory self report and depression as well as between memory self-report and the CVLT variable Short Delay Free Recall. The depressive subscales of Inertia and Self-deprecation also emerged as significant predictors of memory self-report using hierarchical regression analysis. At follow-up assessment, no significant correlations were found between memory self report, depression or any neuropsychological variable. However, the DASS depression subscale of Devaluation of Life entered as a significant predictor of memory self-report. Collectively, these results provide little evidence of a relationship between subjective and objective measures of memory. However, they indicate that relatively non-depressed patients can show mild variants of the cognitive biases and symptoms classically related to clinical depression and that these symptoms correlate significantly with perceptions of memory. Although no consistent trends were found over time, excluding any inferences of causality, this study was the first to systematically examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and memory self-report, with a view to assisting clinicians to identify patients more inclined to over-report memory failure.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coronary heart disease</field><field name="subject">Coronary artery bypass</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80344</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic review of literature relating to the effect of diabetes self-management education on HbA1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes in general practice settings /</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Sally.</field><field name="description">This systematic review presents findings on diabetes self-management education (DSME) as a therapeutic tool to aid glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes in general practice settings.

They are not merely miniature versions of big corporations because not everything that works for big corporations will work for SMEs as well. Thai SMEs need a tool to help them to identify effective leaders for their organizations. Fiedler's Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness has been shown to be able to identify the right leader for various control situations in the United States. However, the model has never been specifically tested on the SMEs in Thailand. To determine whether Fiedler's model is also applicable to Thai SMEs, twelve Thai companies participated in this research study. One supervisory leader was selected from each company to answer the questionnaires provided by the model (translated in Thai) in the form of a structured interview to establish the theoretical effectiveness of the leader. One superior and two subordinates of the same supervisory leader participated in another structured interview to determine the observed effectiveness. The research found only 33.3% percent agreement between theoretical and observed effectiveness. Since the translation process and how the questions were understood by the respondents could be the cause of the low support for the model, the questionnaires that had been translated into Thai were then tested to see if the translation from English to Thai was accurate enough to convey the original work-related meanings that were intended. The results of the tests on the questionnaire show that Thai words used in the questionnaire are acceptable according to the standard English translation with an average of 59 percent of the meanings overlapping each other. Another test was then done using the newly revised translation that focused on the relationship between superior and subordinate at work and the result showed no significant change in the outcomes of the model. The low support for the mode, therefore, was not caused by the translation. Possible reasons for the low support of Fiedler's model include the characteristics of SMEs and the characteristics of Thai culture. The characteristics of both SMEs and Thai culture could affect the nature of the relationship between a superior and subordinate in Thai SMEs that resulted in the poor performance of Fiedler's Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Leadership.</field><field name="subject">Industrial management</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81884</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capabilities differentials as sources of sustainable competitive advantage :</field><field name="creator">Low, Swee Foon.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to review the literature on the intangible resources as sources of sustainable competitive advantage in Malaysian private colleges/institutions From it forms the objective to measure the possession of sources of sustainable competitive advantage and its sustainability.

A conceptual model is developed in this paper to present the likely influence of customer relationship quality with the salesperson on the development of true customer service loyalty (dispositional dimension) to the associated financial service provider firm through personal capitalization on a customer's trust, satisfaction, commitment, affective conflict and reduced perceived risk with the salesperson (attributional dimensions) and a customer's positive perceived service quality of the firm (structural dimension). It is suggested that a strong customer relationship with a financial planning salesperson leads to true service loyalty to the principal, as positive attitudes towards the salesperson are transferred directly to the firm. In situations where a strong relationship develops between the customer and only one particular salesperson, true loyalty to the firm will be a consequential outcome of high personal loyalty and, therefore, rely on the continued availability of the salesperson. To assist managers in encouraging relationship development between their financial planning sales professionals and their customers, potential antecedents of relationship quality in the perspective of sales ethics and interpersonal selling behaviours are identified and discussed in this paper.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship marketing.</field><field name="subject">Customer loyalty.</field><field name="subject">Financial services industry.</field><field name="subject">Financial planners</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81924</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical knowledge management in achieving better outcomes for the Thai software business /</field><field name="creator">Chivangkul, Vichai.</field><field name="description">This research portfolio consists of three linked research papers aiming to show that knowledge management initiatives can play an important role in achieving practical outcomes and enhancing the competitive advantage of business enterprises.

Studies show that Mathematics teachers have fewer uses for the Internet than teachers of other disciplines. Hence, this research adopted a mixed method approach to investigate what mathematics materials are on the Internet, how teachers are teaching mathematics with the Web and mathematic students&#8217; perceptions and engagement with the Internet. This research reviewed the World Wide Web for mathematics materials and found three major groupings of online resources namely interactive resources, non-interactive resources, and communications possibilities. A typology of Web objects was constructed and a database based on a Task-Web object approach was proposed for teacher use. A broad survey was used to elicit information about Internet usage among mathematic teachers. A total of 103 mathematics teachers responded and 15 were interviewed to gain further insight into their usage. Observations of Internet use were also conducted in the classrooms of 4 teachers. The results show that most teachers would like to use the Internet more in their teaching of mathematics but many do not know where and how to do so in an effective way. Statistics, Business Mathematics and Number operations appear to be the more popular topics. Using statistics data from the Web seem to be the Web feature that is most common followed by using the Internet as a resource centre for word problems. Web communications are seldom used. Common constraints teachers face include lack of time, difficulty in planning, lack of knowledge of good Web sites that map to curricula, slow download times, and limited booking times. Students perceive doing activities on the Internet as better than from the textbook because of the amount and variety of information, the better explanations and the change in mode of presentation. Students who have a low comfort level with mathematics wish their teachers would use the Internet. The power of interactive activities on the Internet to engage and motivate these students is due to a variety of reasons such as the element of game play, a change from the routine, its ability to present different conceptual visuals, the independent self-paced learning, and quick feedback that came with the use of the Internet. The Internet also enabled students to access difficult to find information and saved them time. The findings also suggest that teachers&#8217; persistence in using the Internet could bring about a routine that helps students settle down to the task and stay on task. Teachers&#8217; choice and discernment of Web-based activities that are engaging and motivating are paramount to the success of this learning tool. Four Web-based strategies for teaching mathematics were documented and a model of underlying knowledge for teacher practice with the Web was suggested.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Internet in education.</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81993</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A microsimulation model of travel choices for use in transport corridor analysis /</field><field name="creator">Xu, Min.</field><field name="description">The aim of this research project is to improve our understanding of how planning policies, which seek to influence patterns of land use and activities, can promote changes in travel behaviour towards 'more sustainable transport', with particular reference to metropolitian transport corridors.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Highway planning</field><field name="subject">Traffic engineering</field><field name="subject">Transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81857</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and control of drug used populations /</field><field name="creator">Agrawal, Manju</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two parts: practical and theoretical.

Midlife is also seen as a period where the desire to pass on what one has learned, or regeneration, becomes important. These aspects of midlife can be looked at from several perspectives including Jung's theory of personality type which has since been interpreted and extended by Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers to form the basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory.

This is attributed to its unique physical properties, which include long lasting flexibility, hydrophobicity, and depending on the quality of the cork, low permeability. However, after bottling, taint compounds originating from the cork, migrate into the wine and cause an &#8220;off-musty&#8221; odour or taste, which is undesirable. The known taint compounds are geosmin; isoborneol; 1-octen-3-one; 1-octen-3-ol; tetrachloroanisole and finally trichloroanisole, which has been found to be the major cause. Only 7% of all cork-stoppered wines are affected by cork taint. Worldwide, it is estimated that $1 billion per year is lost due to contamination by taint compounds; this does not include other types of food and beverages.

In recent years, many of the recent advances in risk theory have come from the field of financial mathematics. While the latter subject is now well developed we claim that there are still some important aspects of decision-making involving risk that are not covered by the existing theory. In particular, we believe that the following three questions require further investigations. 1. In the financial portfolio management context, if decisions need to be taken at multiple stages, is it possible to devise a time consistent risk minimization policy? 2. If the value of an asset of interest is strongly influenced by a climatic variable (such as temperature or rainfall) that is best modelled by techniques that are not normally used in financial modelling, how should financial derivatives on such an asset be priced? 3. If the undesirable risky phenomenon depends on both the upper and lower tails of a, possibly asymmetric, probability distribution (e.g., that of amount of rainfall), what is a suitable measure of risk in this context? This thesis supplies, at least partial, answers to each of these challenging questions. We hope that these results will motivate others to develop even better solutions.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="subject">Weather</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81946</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gaussian cellular multiple access channels</field><field name="creator">Letzepis, Nicholas Alexander</field><field name="description">The ever increasing demand for wireless services using mobile cellular communication technology has lead to intensive efforts by researchers to determine the information theoretic limitations of these systems.

Because each type of this traffic has specific flow characteristics, each type has to be handled with a certain level of guaranteed quality. So based on that, IETF introduced a Quality of Service tool, called Differentiated Service. It offers different levels of service to different classes of traffic. Even then, the problem of congestion arises due to sharing of a finite bandwith. In the case of real time multi media traffic, congestion due to inadequate bandwith contributes heavily to the quality, whereas in non-real time traffic the effect of congestion is to make data transfer take a longer time. In contrast, real time data become become obsolete if they do not arrive on time. Therefore what is needed is some way of ensuring that during periods of congestion, real time traffic is not affected at all, or is at least given a higher priority than non-real time.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Networks</field><field name="subject">Mobile agents (Computer software).</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol).</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81834</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of abrupt transitions in two-dimensional ideal flows :</field><field name="creator">Kravchuk, Sergiy.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is the development of a method for studying a two-dimensional semi-linear elliptic partial differential equation in an infinite stripe with slow variations of one of the boundaries.

As for an example, Peters and Waterman (1982, page42; listed in Paper 1) explained: &#8220;An old but excellent example is the Ptolemaic view of the universe (which held until the sixteenth century) that the earth was at the centre of the universe, and the moon, sun, planets, and stars were embedded in concentric spheres around it. Elaborate mathematical formulas and models were developed that would accurately predict astronomical events based on the Ptolemaic paradigm. Not until Copernicus and Kepler found that the formula worked more easily when the sun replaced the earth as the centre of it all did an instance of paradigm shift begin.&#8221; It is quite apparent that, in the field of business management, many old concepts, views, and systems have neither led to a right direction for modern business management nor resolved many management problems; therefore, all the three papers of this portfolio try to remedy those shortcomings and insufficiencies of the research problems so as to make potentially valuable contributions to both the academic and business world.

Employers in Singapore put emphasis on short-term cost management and the minimization of overheads. However, maximizing organizational flexibility to the extreme may not be the best option for these firms in Singapore because they may lose control or even lose sight of core positions that are critical to a firm's success. To address the issue, a model can be developed, which will provide a rational approach to help a firm decide whether a position should be externalized or internalized. The rational approach will prevent firms from externalizing positions in an indiscriminate manner and hurting the firms' long term interests.

From an examination of a review of the literature on the Web medium, three topics are discussed. The original and beneficial work presented by Hoffman and Novak (1996) that drew a model WWW communication compared with traditional communication. Next, Sepstrup's criteria (1991 cited in Thomsen, 1996) are used to contrast and compare traditional media and the Web medium. The differences are manifestly pointed out in terms of reach, selectivity, feedback, information capacity and costs. Measuring the effectiveness of media is one important topic of the Web medium that researchers take into consideration nowadays.

The research was exploratory and attempted to discover if SSM and LLM models could be used to structure problems that were common to more than one organization. The research also sought to discover if SSM could be used to build models in the Thai language and in a Thai cultural environment. The experiment can be considered a success in so far as the participants found the results both interesting and informative. Also the research produced a considerable amount of new information that can be used in the marketing of industrial machinery. However, neither the SSM models nor the LLM models could be used in the way their authors had intended. The logical and epistemological status of the models could not be explained in the available contact time. As a result the researcher developed a simplified modelling method.

Personal information privacy is becoming a matter of increasing concern over the Internet. In this review, a description of privacy concerns is attempted and empirical studies in this area are reviewed. The descriptive review includes the antecedents of privacy and security concerns, and privacy assurances. A description of privacy and security concern perspectives and dimensions is also reported in the area of current e-commerce development and policies in Malaysia. The conclusion for the study suggests that privacy assurances, such as Web privacy policy, legislation, and Internet seal of approval will contribute to reduce these perceived threats. It also appears that online privacy concerns are still not solved if personal information is not secured when the above policies and regulations cannot enforce the principles of data privacy. This implies that online security is an important feature to protect and secure personal information. Thus, privacy and security concerns can be a major critical risk factor for the success of B2C e-commerce. No prior studies have yet addressed the issue of privacy concerns in Malaysia. This may therefore need further research to understand the current practices here.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Privacy, Right of.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82794</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical research on job satisfaction of employees in state-owned hotels in Shanghai /</field><field name="creator">Jia, Zhi Yong.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was the following: 1.

The fixed-time signal plan with bandwidth maximization strategy is selected for the studied corridor. Two essential steps in the development are: determination of signal plans and cycle times using Version 2.1 aaSIDRA Micro-analytical software package; and determination of coordination offsets by using Version 5.1 PARAMICS Micro-simulation software package. The PARAMICS is also using in the evaluation of actual and improved traffic condition on Sri-Jan corridor. The results show that the newly proper signal plans and offsets produces significant improvements on the traffic conditions of the Sri-Jan Road. Recommendations on the motorcycle impacts and the projection of future traffic condition have also been provided for further study.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic signs and signals.</field><field name="subject">Electronic traffic controls.</field><field name="subject">Traffic engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82730</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of CUBE dynasim and aaSIDRA for the analysis of a signalized intersection /</field><field name="creator">Yaldi, Gusri.</field><field name="description">Transport systems can be modelled and analysed with two techniques namely analytical and simulation. Until recently, aaSIDRA was the leader in the traffic modelling and analysis software based on analytical theory at micro scale. However, it cannot be used for more than one intersection. Meanwhile, the PARAMICS, AIMSUN NG and VISSIM are micro simulation software which are widely used in modelling and analysing transport systems. Further, CUBE Dynasim is also micro simulation software. It is created by Dynalogic in France and integrated in CUBE by Citilabs, UK. However, this software is relatively new compared to PARAMICS, AIMSUN NG or VISSIM. It is able to model multi nodes and multi modals transport system. The version of software used in this research is CUBE Dynasim 1.4.9 released in 2004 aaSIDRA 2.0 version 2.0.0.205.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Traffic signs and signals.</field><field name="subject">Electronic traffic controls.</field><field name="subject">Traffic engineering.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82753</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting return to work after workplace injury :</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Richard.</field><field name="description">The economic and public health benefits of improving return to work outcomes after workplace injury remain major goals for employers, injured workers and compensation administrators.

It develops and advocates an ideal of dialogical inquiry as the preferred methodological basis for this practice. Underpinned by a dialogical or relational ontology, this ideal suggests that educators, as philosophical inquirers, should attempt to pursue more comprehensive and inclusive understandings of the aims of education, through processes of open and ongoing dialogue with other educational stakeholders that are involved in and/or affected by these aims. Illustrating the importance of this approach to philosophy of education, I argue that dialogical inquiry may go some way toward retrieving the primacy of social justice as an important aim of education, in an intellectual, political and economic context that has witnessed a considerable retreat of concern with this public good.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social justice</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Communication in education.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82861</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data mining for degradation modelling /</field><field name="creator">Lin, Hungyen.</field><field name="description">Accelerated degradation testing is widely accepted in competitive industries. As there is no longer the need to test till failures, there are tremendous cost and time benefits on fully capitalizing on such a testing regime. Consequently, this research has aimed for better understanding of the relationship between design and degradation using the degradation data. Existing work in the literature uses the degradation data to improve the reliability of products. The majority of techniques, however, are centred on statistical experimental methods. For problems with increasing complexities such as large multivariable data set, non-linear interactions and dynamic varying processes, conventional methods cannot resolve the problem efficiently. Furthermore, it can not provide the adequate modelling mechanism to learn from the degradation data autonomously for describing the relationship between the design parameters and degradation. Artificial neural network is widely used for complex problems in the literature. This thesis proposes and demonstrates the neural network modelling methodology into capturing the non parametric relationship between design and degradation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering design.</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Reliability (Engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82722</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of community attitudes to recycled water use :</field><field name="creator">Hurlimann, Anna.</field><field name="description">The use of recycled water has been promoted by policy in many parts of the world under the banner of sustainable water management.

A further problem is significant gaps, uncertainties and assumptions in the literature about community attitudes to recycled water use. The aim of this thesis was to bridge these gaps answering the specific research question: What are the components of community attitudes to and satisfaction with recycled water use?

Despite the increasing use of brand alliances, little research has been done to examine the factors that determine the effectiveness of co-branded brand in brand alliances, or to evaluate the brand attribute of co-branded brand in brand alliances. Based on a critical review of the literature on alliances and brand extension theory, the author developed a conceptual framework to understand how parent brands with association, similarity, and complementary fit can affect the result of brand alliances. The conceptual framework captures the different degrees of similarity, association and complementary fit between parent brands (where one is a header brand and the other is a modifier brand). The research used five different measuring scales: function, performance, perceived quality, perceived image, and premium price to measure the brand attributes of the co-branded brand after the brand alliance to prove that association, similarity, and complementary fit between the parents brands are important factors in determining the brand attributes of the co-branded brand. The findings of the study differ from the findings of previous research in three important ways, and the findings are opposite to those predicted by brand extension theory. Firstly, the study shows that higher &#8220;brand association&#8221; between parent brands dilutes the &#8220;brand attributes&#8221; of the co-branded brand. Secondly, the study shows that the &#8220;brand similarity&#8221; between parent brands does not enhance brand attributes of the co-branded brand. Thirdly, this study shows that &#8220;complementary fit&#8221; between parent brands does not enhance the brand attributes of the co-branded brand. The theories are tested using a qualitative research method with genuine brands in conditions of high consumer involvement. The results show an interesting pattern of interaction among factors. This interaction has important implications for managers in co-brand marketing. The results also provide researchers with promising avenues for further research in brand alliance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brand name products.</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances (Business)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82803</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foaming in Di-Iso propanol amine solutions used in the sweetening of natural gas /</field><field name="creator">de Glanville, Richard.</field><field name="description">In Gas Treating Plants worldwide the most common practice for the measurement of foaminess of alkanolamide solvents used in the sweetening of natural gas is the sparge method. This research investigated the use of an alternative method using optical measurement technology to repeatedly measure the lifetime of a single bubble. A custom built instrument called the "Interfacial Stability Assessor" (ISA) was used in determining which selected components in the acid gas removal unit (AGRU) had an effect on the foaming ability of the treating amine solvent di-isipropanolamine (DIPA). A mass balance of the AGRU was also performed to determine the extent of hydrocarbon absorption in the solvent and foam fractionation carried out on the amine solvent to determine other possible foaming contaminants. All experiments were performed onsite at the North West Shelf Gas Treating Plant in Karratha, Australia. Overall, this research indicates that ISA is extremely sensitive to changes in surface tension and viscosity. All the organic acids tested did not increase the foamability of DIPA, however n-hexane and 'residue' from degradation products did increase the foamability of DIPA at their tested concentration ranges.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural gas.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82816</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra-rapid microwave-stimulated tissue fixation and processing :</field><field name="creator">Haffajee, Zenobia Ayesha Mohammed.</field><field name="description">Thesis (MApSc(BiomedicalScience)--University of South Australia, 2005.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fixation (Histology)</field><field name="subject">Histology technique.</field><field name="subject">Microwaves.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82885</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding media planning practice /</field><field name="creator">Paech, Samantha Jane.</field><field name="description">Annual media expenditure is substantial, accounting for approximately 80%, or US$400 billion, of worldwide advertising expenditure (Coen 2002).

The main features of the algorithm are that it is fast, flexible and fully automatic. A fast algorithm is required because image-super resolution is a procedure that handles a large amount of data. Having a slow or highly complex algorithm may result in computational infeasibility. A flexible algorithm means the algorithm can be customised to handle specific problems, i.e. the algorithm can be augmented with multiple constraints and still obtain an optimal solution. This is desirable as most image super-resolution problems are specific and having the capacity to augment multiple constraints reduces the search space, thus leading to faster convergence. An automatic algorithm is viewed as ideal as it has minimum human intervention and will generate super-resolution images automatically when measured frames are input.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82780</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbo and LDPC coding for the AWGN and space-time channel /</field><field name="creator">Guidi, Andrew Mark.</field><field name="description">The main focus of this thesis is the investigation of a number of different space-time coding scenarios based on predominately the application of turbo codes and low density parity check (LDPC) codes to a multi-antenna system. Both codes structures make use of the BPSK stacking construction that readily applies binary linear codes to the space-time channel while also providing a check on the suitability of the resulting code in order to achieve maximum diversity advantage. The turbo-like codes investigated are based upon the application of a parallel concatenated scheme to directly map the data and parity bits generated by the encoder to one of three possible antennas outputs. It is further highlighted in this case how the interleaver plays a crucial role in determining overall performance as this determines whether the resulting space-time codes achieve maximum diversity advantage or otherwise. Performance results are presented for a number of different constituent codes and interleaver design. The LDPC space-time codes considered herein again are based on satisfying the BPSK stacking construction to ensure full diversity advantage is achieved. The code design is based on a recursive application of the Shur complement in order to devise block based codes that have a resulting parity check matrix that is relatively sparse. A number of various code constructions that satisfy the conditions are then simulated in order to determine performance in both slow and fast fading channel conditions. This thesis also investigates the use of certain non-linear codes termed &#8220;chaotic codes&#8221; and their application as constituent codes within a parallel concatenated (turbo-like) coding scheme. Performance of such codes is shown to be readily analysed via the use extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) techniques. The modified codes are simulated over an AWGN channel using BPSK modulation for a number of different block lengths.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space time codes.</field><field name="subject">Coding theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82809</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transfer of antibiotic resistance between commensal gut bacteria of human and animal origin /</field><field name="creator">Hart, Wendy S.</field><field name="description">The global threat from antibiotic resistant organisms and the effect on human and animal health is now well acknowledged.

As the cell volume was increased, the mean energy dissipation was proportional to N&#179;D, rather than N&#179;D&#178; as may be expected based on dimensional analysis. Possible reasons for this difference are discussed. Aeration resulted in a slight increase in mean energy dissipation. Bubble diameters were measured using a University of Cape Town bubble size analyser to determine the frother concentration at which a constant bubble diameter was achieved for all operating conditions and cell volumes. The critical frother concentration required to achieve this was 20 ppm MIBC.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flotation.</field><field name="subject">Bubbles</field><field name="subject">Impellers.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82937</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illness, recovery and renewal :</field><field name="creator">Thorley, Christine (Faith).</field><field name="description">This thesis is autobiographical in nature and follows my life experiences relating to the development and subsequent removal of a large epidermoid brain tumour.

For women, the years beyond paid employment have special significance as their paid work experiences are most often dissimilar from those of men, with subsequently different implications for retirement. While there is a wealth of research on the economic consequences of gendered workplaces and therefore gendered retirement, there are few if any studies of the on-going lived experiences of women retirees. This thesis is one attempt to fill this significant gap. Specifically, it tracks 21 old aged women, including myself, as we negotiate the times beyond paid employment. Beginning in the imaginings and practices of retirement taken up by time-stressed employees as responses to the promise of future liberation, the thesis traces how we as old aged women articulate our experiences within normalised notions of what being retired and old signify.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Older women.</field><field name="subject">Retirement</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82737</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The diagnosis and prevention of rhodococcus equi infections in foals /</field><field name="creator">Vanniasinkam, Thirumahal.</field><field name="description">Rhodococcus equi is a non-motile, Gram positive actinomycete that is ubiquitous in the environment and is recognised as one of the most significant respiratory pathogens in foals below six months of age.

In this tissue, ClC-1 contributes to repolarisation and stabilisation of the membrane potential after an action potential. In the absence of ClC-1 function, voltage-gated sodium channels can recover from inactivation before the membrane potential has returned to resting levels, and hence can reopen without further stimulus, resulting in a run of contractions. Clinically, this phenomenon leads to the muscle stiffness disease myotonia. Members of the CLC family of proteins have been identified in many species from bacteria to mammals, and the X-ray crystallographic structure of a bacterial member of this family revealed a complex structure with 17 intramembrane helices. These proteins exist as a functional dimer, with a separate permeation pore within each subunit. There appears to be two separate gating mechanisms; the fast gate which acts on each pore independently and the slow or common gate operating on both pores simultaneously. The aim of this study was to identify functionally important regions within the ClC-1 channel, with the ultimate aim of elucidating the mechanisms involved in gating.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Skeleton.</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal system.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/82924</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between service quality with customer satisfaction and academic achievement in private institutions of higher learning /</field><field name="creator">Mohtar, Shahimi Bin.</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction and academic achievement in private institutions of higher learning.

To clarify the evolution of traditional transaction-based HR management to a proactive and strategic approach, the multiple meanings and dimensions of the HR strategic partnership are critically compared to determine the extent to which they might add value to the organization. The study also examines the perception of HR practitioners about what influences them in becoming strategic partners. In addition, the extent to which HR practitioners in Thailand perceive that the HR strategic planning process is linked to the overall organizational planning process is examined and analysed. This study and the corresponding assessment instrument were created as an extension of two previous investigations into the extent to which HR practitioners were becoming more strategic within their business, with additional material for the assessment developed by the researcher. The questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 800 HR professionals who are current members of the Personnel Management Association of Thailand (PMAT) during the period of May 15 to June 15, 2004.

Of interest will be the understanding of the attributes of leadership which the members would prefer. If these preferences of the members can be examined in the context of consumer/voter behaviour or decision in the electoral marketplace based on the contention that the leaders are products and services, we can bring marketing concepts and tools to the study of voter behaviour or decision (in elections) and so take a step towards an understanding of leadership while providing new evidence concerning MCA members' preferences for their President.

The research focuses on managerial behaviour dimensions of assertiveness and responsiveness, and organizational culture dimension of trust. The elements of assertiveness and responsiveness used in this research are based on the research by Darling and Fischer (1998), and the elements of trust are based on the research by Bijlsma and van de Bunt (2003). Survey questionnaires, sent to respondents through email as well as through the post, are used to determine the existing managerial behaviours and the level of trust in respondents' organisations. Respondents are employees of organisations that are members of the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM). Correlations analysis of the responses shows that managerial behaviour of assertiveness is significantly correlated with organisational culture of trust in the organisation, while responsiveness is not significantly correlated. Further analysis shows that the following elements are significantly correlated with trust: thorough, systematic, pragmatic, determined, enthusiastic, outgoing, and persuasive. The results are in line with other studies that indicate that for employees to have trust in the organisation, managers must exhibit both control and supportive behaviours. The implications of the results of the results of the research are discussed in this report. If there is a high level of trust in the organisation, team work will be strong and initiatives can be implemented effectively. If management detects a high level of distrust in the organisation, it should study the managerial behaviours and take actions to institute changes. These actions are outlined in this report. The discussion on the implications of the results and the recommended actions provide practical applications of the results, which renders this research invaluable for managers seriously looking at instilling trust in their organisations. Other issues pertaining to questionnaire survey research are also discussed. These include problems associated with conducting survey through email. These discussions are useful for researchers wishing to conduct survey through email. There is also a discussion on egocentric bias response in questionnaire or interview survey. This refers to the tendency of respondents to put in self-interest when responding to questionnaire on interview survey.

These non-financial costs include lower morale among remaining employees and losses in expertise and experience.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employee retention</field><field name="subject">Labor turnover</field><field name="subject">Retail trade</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79677</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal performance analysis of a roof integrated solar heating system incorporating phase change thermal storage /</field><field name="creator">Halawa, Edward Eh.</field><field name="description">Space heating is one of the simplest and most appealing applications of solar energy.

In current practice, clinicians assess loosening by visually inspecting a number of standard x-ray images of the patient's hip joint, taken over a period of time.

ISR information can be collected from a number of sources such as surveillance aircraft, satellites, human intelligence collectors etc. Once ISR information is collected it is the responsibility of the 'ISR processing system' to collate the information, conduct analysis and processing on the information items in a way that adds value to the information and finally, to move the information items to ISR end-users who are able to make use of the information. Initially, this thesis provides a detailed examination of the information 'need', of ISR end-users, that is fulfilled by an ISR processing system and proposes a technique for examining the way in which that need changes across the broad spectrum of military operations. The environment in which an ISR processing system resides is also examined and a set of attributes are proposed for describing those aspects of the environment which potentially affect the operation of a processing system. In recent times, two distinctly different approaches to the conduct of ISR processing have gained significant attention: Task, Process, Exploit, Disseminate (TPED) and Task, Post Process, Use (TPPU). However, in practice, hybrid ISR processing systems may be built which exhibit some characteristics of both of these approaches. The comparative strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are examined and a framework is proposed for matching the information needs of end-users and the system's operating environment to the most suitable configuration of a hybrid processing system.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military surveillance.</field><field name="subject">Military intelligence.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79693</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Violence among nurses :</field><field name="creator">Hockley, Charmaine.</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns violence among nurses in their formalised working relationships.

Both methods were patented in France in the early 1920s. Solomit patents registered by Serge Tchayeff in France, Australia, and Britain, and patents for bale building by Emile Feuillette registered in France and the US, are analysed. The vernacular precedents of both are argued. The South Australian patents connected to Solomit and registered during the later 1930s are discussed. This study broadly establishes the history of the initial South Australian venture (1935-1937) to manufacture Solomit under licence from Germany and to establish widespread Solomit construction; it notes Solomit's admission (in principle) to the Building Act 1940 (SA); and identifies examples of government building tenders won by the company. Although certain evidence establishes the naivety of the South Australian enterprise about German socio-political realities of 1933-1937, I consider the possibility that Australian Solomit manufacture may have held political promise for the NSDAP (German Nazi Party) in Australia, and follow an assumption that in South America, strongly influenced by NSDAP Germany, the aggressor exploited Solomit for import-export advantages tenuously connected to building projects.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Straw bale houses.</field><field name="subject">Building materials</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79686</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-controlled energy efficient switchable transformer /</field><field name="creator">Dharmawan, Hari Arief.</field><field name="description">Efficiency is always of great concern in the designs of machines.

Transport planning is essential in road network development to assist decision makers in selecting alternatives to be considered and in explaining the reasons for selecting an alternative to the public.

In the evaluation step, alternatives are analysed in order to value the merit of alternatives and to decide when the selected alternative/s should be implemented. Transport demand modelling is applied to estimate the effects of alternatives on transport demand. The development of an evaluation system and transport demand model in this research accounts for several factors usually found in developing countries such as the lack of qualified professional planners and technical resources, reliability and availability of data, and stability of land use structure and economic condition.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Highway planning</field><field name="subject">Highway planning</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79641</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of adsorbing polymers on solid surface wettability /</field><field name="creator">Kaggwa, Gillian.</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this research study was to investigate the influence of adsorbing polymers on surface wettability.

Additionally, the second major step in agent teaming is the &#8220;human-centric&#8221; nature of the agent.

The problem with the traditional canon of art history was its fascination with the 'great masters' and its inability to acknowledge the larger religious and social issues which affected artisans of the time. In order to counteract these shortcomings, this study presents a social and cultural biography of an 'average' Florentine Renaissance artisan, named Jacopo del Sellaio (1442-1493). Jacopo is an ideal foil for the so-called 'great master' painters of the late quattrocentro because, comparatively, he was as socially and financially successful as his more famous counterparts. An examination of his life also demonstrates that Florentine Renaissance artisans were not isolated in their creative efforts but were inextricably bound to their communities by a multitude of complex social processes and institutions. This challenges many of the traditional misconceptions surrounding the Renaissance and offers a more holistic approach in the study of art history.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sellaio, Jacopo del,</field><field name="subject">Painting, Italian</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79752</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a model for the online delivery of nurse education /</field><field name="creator">Gillham, David</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a well-defined sequential program of education projects in the area of online nurse and health sciences education culminating in a model for online nurse education based on the concept of a shared database.

Another area of increasing focus is performance management. The profusion of literature on the balanced scorecard combining financial and non-financial measures demonstrates the interest in both professional and academic circles with improving effective feedback for performance in this area. In particular, the balanced scorecard is viewed as the performance measurement system most likely to encourage the development of a learning culture and managing organisational learning.

More recently, statistical analysis of raw device level network measurements (e.g. variables from the management information bases maintained by network devices) has been explored. Whilst these approaches have proven valuable, they are most suitable for detecting problems, such as network device failures, that are local to the devices where measurements are collected. To complement these techniques a network-wide (or global) approach is required, whereby the dynamic behaviour of a network, in terms of topology and traffic flow, is measured and used for anomaly detection purposes. This method combines flow information taken throughout a network. Such an approach is capable of modelling the behaviour of traffic generated by network users, and hence can better define the cause of certain network anomalies.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79668</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speaking from experience : the work of consumer and carer advocates in educating mental health professionals</field><field name="creator">Loughhead, Mark</field><field name="description">This study explores the teaching role of activists and community advocates who have become involved in the education and preparation of mental health professionals.

These factors are categorised as environmental (those external to the individual), interpersonal (relating to interactions with others), and individual (those internal and particular to the individual). These categories correspond broadly to existing theoretical approaches to understanding prison environments. The deprivation model is concerned largely with physical, structural, and contextual factors (features pertaining to the prison). In contrast, the importation model focuses on dispositional characteristics or static factors (features the individual brings to prison). While the deprivation model implies the environment shapes the individual, the importation model implies that the individual shapes its environment. Neither of these models, however, addresses the interactional and ongoing nature of adaptation to a social climate. While not exhaustive, the factors presented in this review are considered important for understanding the social climate of a prison. There are likely to be numerous other factors which also influence an individual's adjustment to the social climate (and the influence of adjustment on the climate). The model presented in this review attempts to draw these factors together, while recognising the inherent difficulties in attempting research from an interactional approach. That is, change is ongoing and individuals are continually evolving - as the person changes, the social climate changes and as the climate changes, the individual must change again. Research must continue to look at each of the individual components and their relationship with each other in order to understand the particular climate of an institution, while recognising the dynamic nature of adaptation.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Imprisonment</field><field name="subject">Correctional psychology.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79587</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substance use and young offenders /</field><field name="creator">Hackett, Louisa.</field><field name="description">The extremely high prevalence of substance abuse among young offenders and the significant personal harms associated with such use highlights the need for the development and delivery of effective intervention programs. This thesis explores the beliefs of young offenders about their substance use and offending behaviour in order to inform the development of more engaging and potentially more effective intervention approaches. A grounded theory methodology was used, involving interviews with fourteen young offenders. The beliefs of participants about themselves and their behaviour were understood in terms of basic human needs for relatedness, autonomy and competence. It is concluded that interventions with young offenders who abuse substances should be designed in ways that help to overcome the internal and environmental barriers that prevent these needs being met.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug abuse and crime.</field><field name="subject">Substance abuse</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquency</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79624</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of thermal biofeedback on sleep onset latency in older adults /</field><field name="creator">Bothma, Joanna M</field><field name="description">Thesis (MPsy(Clinical))--University of South Australia, 2005.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofeedback training.</field><field name="subject">Biological control systems.</field><field name="subject">Sleep</field><field name="subject">Body temperature</field><field name="subject">Insomnia.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79753</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of auditory hallucinations in non-psychotic children /</field><field name="creator">Best, Nicole</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of auditory hallucinations in clinical populations of non-psychotic children is an intriguing and little understood area. To date, investigations in this area have reported on a range of correlates, including family histories of psychiatric illness, family dysfunction, and significant levels of stress in the children themselves. The current study reported on 10 non-psychotic children drawn from a number of community based child and family agencies that provide therapeutic out-patient services. Consistent with previous studies this study found strong associations with family dysfunction, specifically family break-up, as well as significant levels of anxiety and depression in the these children. In addition, half the children reported the presence of imaginary companions. Despite some confirmation of previous findings, many other features of this phenomenon remain unanswered including the different psychological functions that hallucinations and imaginary companions serve for emotionally troubled children. Two case studies describe the family histories and hallucinations in more detail.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79723</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between chronic pain and blame assignment /</field><field name="creator">Burns, Melody.</field><field name="description">DeGood and Kiernan (1996) demonstrated that chronic pain patients who assigned blame to others for their pain reported greater concurrent mood distress, behavioural disturbance, poorer response to past treatment, and lesser expectations of future treatment benefits than participants who did not blame anyone for their pain. The present study partially replicated the DeGood and Kiernan study. Subjects were 210 (110 males and 100 females) chronic pain patients from the Flinders Medical Centre Pain Management Unit in Adelaide, South Australia. Participants completed self-report measures of demographic, psychosocial, and behavioural variables. Contrary to DeGood and Kiernan's (1996) results, other-blame was not found to be a significant predictor of poor response to past pain treatments. Rather, linear multiple regression analyses revealed that a perceived sense of control over pain was a significant predictor of confidence in past pain relief treatments. A logistic regression revealed that time since onset of pain was the only significant predictor of the tendency to blame others.

A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was adopted. Intervention comprised patients attending the Comprehensive Outpatient Pain Education and Rehabilitation (COPER) program, which is an intensive, inter-disciplinary, three-week, cognitive behaviour therapy based outpatient chronic pain treatment. Statistical analysis comprised pre-treatment and post-treatment means and standard deviations, effect sizes, paired samples t-tests, and Cronbach's alpha. Australian norms for 86 (42 males and 44 females) patients were presented for initial values and treatment-related improvements. Internal consistency reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) demonstrated that the TOPS was a reliable measure of group outcomes. Two dimensions, Life control and Total Pain Experience, were sensitive enough to follow individual patients. All SF-36 domains and ten of the fourteen TOPS domains improved significantly following treatment. Despite the limitations to this research, the results are consistent with previous findings (Fishbain, 2000; Morley, Eccleston, &amp; Williams, 1999) that cognitive behavioural, multidisciplinary pain treatment is associated with improvement in a number of biopsychosocial aspects of chronic pain as measured by the TOPS. These include Pain Symptom, Lower Body Functional Limitations, Perceived Family/Social Disability, Objective Family/Social Disability, Total Pain Experience, Life Control, Solicitous Responses, Upper Body Functional Limitations, Fear Avoidance, Patient Satisfaction with Outcomes, as well as general health and wellbeing aspects measured by the SF-36 component of the TOPS.
