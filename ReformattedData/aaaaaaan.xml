The research explored the workplace environment and sought to gain a greater understanding of the elements that contribute to a safe and healthy workplace setting.The research methodology utilised a critical feminist framework. Thirteen women participants were involved in the research project including myself as a research participant. All participants were employed in an acute mental health facility in New South Wales. Four research methods were incorporated into the study these were focus groups, individual interviews, reflective journaling and creative expression and journaling. The study revealed a diverse range of opinion on nursing culture and profession, linking individual experience with group connectiveness, value and belonging.The findings of this research demonstrated that the women&#8217;s experience and practices as registered nurses working in mental health care were influenced directly by the management of the health service organisation and the operational leadership within the mental health facility. The data revealed five themes, these were: stress and mental health nursing practice, coping with violence, professional development, the spirit of nursing and the therapeutic relationship.Overall there were numerous links between the women&#8217;s experiences as nurses and their relationships with their colleagues, patients and the community. The results exposed professional pressures and inherent tensions within mental health nursing and highlighted an urgency to review a current health care structureThe study identified environmental factors that impacted upon the workplace and revealed a dichotomy between the nurses&#8217; perception of care and their ability to provide it. The research raised disquiet regarding violence and aggression, inadequate career structure, recruitment, retention and education. Jutxaposed to this, the research identified collegial friendship, spirituality and stress management as contributing factors to a safe and healthy workplace. Finally, the notions of teamwork, diversity and creativity were found to be intrinsically linked to job satisfaction and client outcome.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and molecular evaluation of quality for malt and feed barley</field><field name="creator">Fox, Glen P</field><field name="description">Barley is the second largest grain crop produced in Australia and has two primary end uses. The first use is the premium market for malt and beer production. The second use is animal consumption. The quality of barley for the range of end uses is influenced by the cultivar itself as well as the growing environment. A detailed understanding of these factors at the genetic and biochemical levels was required to enable breeding program to select for quality improvement. A number of grain and end product quality traits were assessed for genetic and environmental affects as well as their interaction.Grain size has an important impact on quality and large plump grain is desirable for malt and feed quality. The results from the research conducted in this study clearly show that grain size was affected by cultivar and environmental conditions. Using screenings (&lt; 2.2 mm) and retention (&gt; 2.5mm) data provided information on how cultivars performed under a range of environmental conditions, which included irrigated (water unlimited) to terminal moisture stress (no in crop rain). The results showed a strong genetic component in the variation in grain size and it would be possible to select for increased grain size but also stable grain size when considering cultivars grown under adverse environmental conditions.The husk content in barley impacts on malt and feed quality. The results in this studied showed there were significant genetic effects as well as environments effects on the level of husk. In addition, it was identified that the genetic regions controlled husk expression were associated with two other quality traits, namely, resistance to kernel discolouration and resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (dormancy). These regions on chromosome 4H and 6H are also associated with previously identified dormancy genes.Hardness is a trait not usually considered when assessing barley quality but the results from this study showed there are differences in the level of barley hardness, as measured by three methods, as well as differences in the hardness gene sequence. The three hardness methods used showed that barley hardness could be measured independently of the method used, but also that there were significant genetic and environmental effects on hardness. However, the results from sequencing for allelic variation in the hardness genes showed that while there was polymorphism, and hance the transcribed protein had little effect on variation in quality. The cultivars used were malting and feed cultivars and a set of iv breeding lines targeted at malt quality. It may be possible to identify diverse haplotypes from the use of wild relatives or landraces.This study also investigated the variation in barley for cattle feed quality. Feed quality was determined using an in-sacco dry matter digestibility (ISDMD) assay in fistulated cows as well as three other laboratory assays, namely acid detergent fibre, starch and particle size. These four traits are then used to calculate Net Energy (NE) and Average Daily Gain (ADG). The results show that there were genetic and environmental effects on feed quality. The key trait was the ISDMD assay and there were significant differences between the cultivars tested. The data suggested feed quality was a measurable and definable attribute that could be used in breeding selection.The final aspect of this study compared the feed data obtained with routine malt quality traits, of friability and hot water extract. There were strong genetic and environmental effects. The malting cultivars generally had the highest level of ADG and NE. The results also showed that there were negative correlations between extract and husk, ISDMD and ADG. Positive correlations were shown between friability and hardness, extract and test weight, and there was only a slight correlation between average daily gain and extract.An important aspect of this study was the calculation of the genetic component for each trait. This was carried using spatial analysis of mixed models. It was necessary to use this approach so a true estimation of the genetic component could be calculated which would then allow for the calculation of heritability. In plant breeding, the cultivar is not a fixed effect but rather a random variable, hence it was not possible to use normal analysis of variation (ANOVA) models. Rather models were written with cultivars, like environment and field position, as random effects which will allow the effect of each random variable to be accounted for in the analysis. Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) are calculated and presented for all traits.For all the traits measured in this study, heritability values were calculated to ascertain the level of success in improving these traits through breeding. The range in heritability for grain size was 40 to 90%, husk 30 to 60%, hardness, 40 to 90%, feed quality traits 20 to 80% and malt quality traits 40 to 90%. Generally most traits exhibited a moderate to high level of heritability which indicated genetic improvement was possible through the use of appropriate genetic material.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">malt</field><field name="subject">heritability</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">genotype</field><field name="subject">feed</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing in the lion's den: women leaders in local government</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Roslyn</field><field name="description">During the twentieth century, women were elected into all spheres of government and political leadership positions in increasing numbers. Still, their numbers are substantially lower than their representation in the population. The same trend is evident in local government in many countries. With few exceptions, there are now more women numerically and proportionately in local government than in state or national governments. Nevertheless, the limited research on women representatives in local government demonstrates that the environment of local government is not necessarily comfortable for women. Many more women than men leave local government voluntarily. If women who are currently practising politics inside local government leave in substantial numbers then little will change. This means that women entering it in the future will face the same environments and challenges (Freeman &amp; Bourque 2001).Against this background, the research study seeks to provide an explanation of how different women experience and perceive positions traditionally held by men, whether there are shared understandings and experiences that transcend the women&#8217;s differences and whether they are changing the environment of local government. To investigate these questions, I employ qualitative feminist research within a framework of feminist political theory, drawing broadly on a range of feminist theory and a variety of political emphases. I interview forty-nine women leaders in local government from England, Sweden, India, the Philippines and Australia, investigating their perspectives and practice thus weighing theory with practice.Several theoretical and practical themes emerge from these findings. The practice revealed by the interviewees is complex, ambiguous and nuanced, consistent with the feminist valuation of relationship, context and the particular. The interviewees bring a different social perspective, reflecting their situated experiences, to their work. This transforms the masculinist environment of the lion&#8217;s den in significant, albeit subtle, ways. The practice of the interviewees shapes agendas and decision-making processes, changes the way representatives of both genders feel about those processes, and molds outcomes for their communities in subtle but distinct ways. In addition, many of the interviewees use their agency actively to change the practices and environment of their councils.I conclude that the practice revealed by these interviewees is best described as a dance in a complex and alien environment, within which women make a palpable difference. This supports arguments for increasing women at the leadership level in both the administrative and political areas of local government, supported by a critical mass of women councillors. More than that, it testifies to the urgency of that task if local government &#8211; the lion&#8217;s den &#8211; is to be more representative of the diverse people it purports to represent.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">difference</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/97</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of high intensity exercise on fat loss in young overweight women</field><field name="creator">Trapp, Ethlyn Gail, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of high intensity, intermittent exercise (HIIE) on fat loss in young, sedentary women. It attempted also to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced changes in adiposity. Study 1 investigated some of the metabolic and hormonal responses to two variations of HIIE. Sixteen female subjects were tested. The first session involved a cycle ergometer VO2peak test. The next two sessions were completed in random order. After baseline measures the women did 20 min of HIIE. There was a short bout exercise of 8 s work, followed by 12 s relative rest and a long bout exercise of 24 s work followed by 36 s relative rest. Seven subjects had excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and resting metabolic rate determined. Both exercise modalities made significant demands on the participants??? oxygen delivery systems. RER diminished over the 20 min of exercise and plasma glycerol concentrations increased. Lactate concentrations rose. Catecholamine concentrations were elevated postexercise. There was an elevated EPOC associated with above baseline fat utilisation. Study 2, a 15-week training study, was a randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of short bout HIIE and steady state (SS) exercise on fat loss. Forty-five women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: HIIE, SS, or control. Preliminary and posttraining testing included a DEXA scan and a VO2peak test including blood collection. All participants completed 3-d diet diaries and maintained their current diet for the course of the study. Participants exercised three times a week for the next 15 weeks under supervision. The HIIE group did 20 min of HIIE (8 s work:12 s rest)  at a workload determined from the VO2peak test. The SS group cycled at 60%VO2peak , building to a maximum of 40 min exercise. Both exercise groups increased VO2peak . The HIIE group had a significant loss of total body mass (TBM) and fat mass (FM) when compared to the other groups. There was no change in dietary intake. There have been a number of studies examining the acute effects of HIIE but, to our knowledge, this is the first study examining the chronic effects of this particular exercise protocol.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overweight women</field><field name="subject">Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Exercise tests</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mythological state and its empire</field><field name="creator">Grant, David John, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">legitimate because it is not the persistence of a secularised theological concept. Although it reoccupied mirror-image pre-Enlightenment questions, say regarding absolutism, it is not first concerned with such categories as ???sovereignty, raison d???etat, will, decision, friend-enemy??? but with ???contract, consent, liberty, law and rights???. However, in Work on Myth, he proposes that man is, and has always been, a maker of mythological magnitudes, of which there can be argued to be an archetypal form. These magnitudes are so fearsome as to allow man to convert his existential fear into fear of an entity the fate of which he can gradually bring into his own hands. In this way, there is the promise of the elimination of existential fear and of the experience of sympathetic conditions of existence. Blumenberg does not address political issues, such as the nature of the State. However, if the State can be shown to be such a magnitude and therefore a political realisation of such an archetype, then it is mythological and so is not modern, even if it is legitimate. It then needs to be criticised to allow the introduction of a radical notion of Enlightenment. The effect of such criticisms would be the replacement of the notions of fear and sympathy with that of self-responsibility as the first interest of the State. Selfresponsibility would need to be promoted progressively. It would require a reconfigured State the prime purpose of which is the promotion of respect and self-reliance of individuals. Its first concern would therefore not be the elimination of fear, which would be understood as unable to be eliminated, nor the creation by it of sympathetic conditions of existence, which would be better a matter for properly prepared and supported, selfreliant individuals. The debate then would be around this axis, where contingency is accepted and managed, not the mythological axis of liberalism and republicanism which has dominated modern political theory since Hobbes. This thesis is first an exploration of the viability of the mythological idea of the State, whether the State is a political realisation of the archetypal myth. It does this through an examination of such thinkers in the political tradition as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Kant, Rawls and Pettit. The conclusion of this examination is, in sum, that the idea of the State since Hobbes has been, and remains, mythological since it shows all the key characteristics of a mythological entity and the arguments for it have mythological presumptions. It is still first concerned with the fear/sympathy nexus and the debates of the political tradition from Hobbes to Pettit have been carried out around that axis. Further, this is argued to be an arrangement which promotes dominant interests rather than widespread participation of non-autonomous, self-responsible individuals. But if this notion of the State as a progressively refined and dispersed mythological entity is viable, it cannot have existed only in the minds of those in the political theoretical tradition. We should expect to see evidence of it in the beliefs and practices of individual  men and women. It must have been not just a political realisation of the mythological State as an idea, but an embodied notion. This thesis is also an exploration of the evidence for that embodiment. It does this by looking at Elias??? analysis of the civilising process in the Middle Ages, at Foucault???s analysis of the emergence and proliferation of the disciplines and the art of government from the 17th century and at the dispersal of the myth through cultural imperialism in the 18th century. The conclusions of these analyses are reinforced by the social ontology of Wittgenstein. Further argument for this embodiment is presented regarding both the common notion of citizenship and the perception of other cultures, that each manifest mythological characteristics. Such embodied practices can be seen as strategies promoted through the State by dominant interests, the purpose of which are the claims to generally eliminate fear and create sympathetic conditions of existence. This embodiment reinforces the initial argument that the idea of the State did emerge and has been established and gradually refined as mythological. In essence and in large part, this is a genealogy of post-Hobbesian political society as mythological. That is, as the political realisation of the archetypal mythological form and its embodiment in the material practice of individuals. The explanatory value of this way of perceiving the State is then demonstrated by its application to the complex conditions of the destruction of traditional Aboriginal culture by the colonising and civilising British, that is the dispersal of the mythological State as empire. From this, it is argued that the mythological understanding of the State is more illuminating that other approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">State, The</field><field name="subject">Mythology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microfabrication technology for an integrated monolithic electromagnetic microactuator based on polymer bonded permanent magnet.</field><field name="creator">Rojanapornpun, Olarn, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electromagnetic microactuators with permanent magnets have many potential applications such as micro-energy scavengers, microswitches, micromirrors and microfluidics. However, many electromagnetic microactuator designs utilize either external permanent magnet or external coil, which do not allow tight integration to other MEMS components and further miniaturization. Furthermore, all of the available permanent magnet microfabrication technologies have some drawbacks and improvements are required. Thus the integrated monolithic electromagnetic microactuator is investigated in this project. The three main components of the electromagnetic actuator have been investigated separately. A novel microfabrication technology called ???Template printing???for the fabrication of polymer bonded permanent magnet has been investigated and developed. It is based on ???Screen printing??? which has its drawbacks on alignment accuracy and poor line definition. This is eliminated in ???Template printing??? by photolithography of the photoresist template. The shape and location of the permanent magnet is defined by the template. A new approach based on the filling of dry magnetic powder and vacuum impregnation has been developed to form the polymer bonded permanent magnet. This allows the use of short pot-life matrix material and the elimination of homogenous mixing. A monolithic electromagnetic microactuator has been fabricated successfully. It consists of a 2-layer planar copper microcoil, surface micromachined polyimide beam and Strontium ferrite/EPOFIX permanent magnet (diameter of 460 ??m and 30 ??m thickness). Large deflection in excess of 100 ??m at 35 mA driving current and magnetic force of 0.39 ??N/mA have been achieved. It compares favourably with other much larger electromagnetic actuators that have been reported. ???Template printing??? has the potential of being a low temperature batch process for the microfabrication of thick polymer bonded permanent magnets with high magnetic properties and low residual stress. The fabrication consistency and the quality of template printed magnet can be improved in future studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microactuators -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Microfabrication.</field><field name="subject">Permanent magnets -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of coal quality factors on seam permeability associated with coalbed methane production</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xingjin, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cleats are natural fractures in coal that serve as permeability avenues for darcy flow of gas and water to the well bore during production. Theoretically, the development of cleat and coal-seam permeability is related to the rank, type and grade of the coal concerned. The permeability of a coal seam, moreover, may change during gas production, due to either matrix shrinkage, cleat closure or both. Matrix shrinkage and cleat closure are also affected by numerous geological factors, including coal rank, desorption character and geological setting.  A method integrating geochemical and petrographic analysis, reservoir engineering diagnosis, geophysical data and production characteristics has been developed, and used to determine the initial permeability of coal seam on a metre by metre scale. This overcomes the constraint of conventional well test by refining the test intervals.  The effect of coal rank, grade and type on the initial permeability of coal seams was also investigated, with the special reference to the coals of the Galilee Basin. The permeability was estimated using analytical equations based on the permeability data obtained from well tests and from cleat descriptions within the seam section. This aspect of the study showed that the coal type, rank and grade strongly influence the initial permeability of individual coal seams. Increase in ash content has negative effect on cleat development and permeability. On contrast, increasing coal rank and proportion of bright coal lead to reduction in cleat spacing and increase in permeability.  Twenty three core samples collected from the Qinshui Basin in China were evaluated in the laboratory to investigate the effects of coal grade, rank and type on the change in permeability during pressure depletion. The experimental factors included the coal's geochemical properties, the permeability against changing pressure, and strain with pore pressure depletion. This part of the study fund that permeability changes with pore pressure depletion in relation to coal rank, grade and type. The strain values determined by the experiments with pressure depletion were used to identify the mechanical principles associated with changes in permeability during pressure depletion in relation to the rank, grade and type of the coal concerned.  A reservoir simulation study was used to investigate the effects of desorption pressure, geological setting and coal rank on the variation in permeability under in-situ conditions during coalbed methane production, based on a study in the Hedong area, Ordos Basin, China. The simulations allowed history matching of gas and water production from 12 wells with the actual well conditions specified as the model pressure. Good agreement was achieved between the model yields and the actual production data, suggesting that the changing permeability interpreted from the simulation is a realistic representation of the in-situ reservoir properties.  The reservoir simulation study found that the decreases in permeability with production exceeded the increase in permeability caused by matrix shrinkage for nearly all wells in the Hedong area. The magnitude of the decrease in permeability increases as the gap between initial pressure and desorption pressure increases. The decrease in permeability is slower in the zone closest to the fault. The reservoir simulation has demonstrated that coal rank influences significantly the change in permeability during coalbed methane production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal.</field><field name="subject">Coalbed methane.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renouncing the recent past, 'revolutionising' the present and 'resurrecting' the distant past: lexical and figurative representations in the political speeches of Georgios Papadopoulos (1967-73)</field><field name="creator">Mikedakis, Emmanuela, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the political speeches of the Greek dictator Georgios Papadopoulos from the time his regime -- the self-titled 'Revolution of the 21st April' -- usurped power in 1967 until he himself was ousted in November 1973. The thesis proposes that the underlying aim of all of Papadopoulos's political speeches is the construction of a cyclical narrative of a past, present and future Greece. According to his political speeches, this construct proposes a 'dangerous', 'corrupt' and 'undemocratic' recent past that necessitated his 'Revolutionary' present; a 'revolutionary' present that strives to create the preconditions for a 'prosperous' future Greece; and a future Greece that shall embody the 'Helleno-Christian' ideals of the distant past, and detach itself from the failings of the recent past.  The premise on which the research is founded is that patterns in his political speeches can be quantitatively identified and that, from these patterns, a qualitative interpretation can be developed. Thus, quantitative data were collated concerning the frequency of key terms and concepts, both literal and figurative, in all of Papadopoulos's political speeches and, then, cross-referenced with audience composition and date of delivery. These data were subsequently analysed holistically in the context of the political, social, economic and cultural aspects of Greece's recent history.  The thesis developed from the data is divided into three parts. The first part examines the history immediately before and during the 7-year dictatorship. The second and third parts consider specific lexical terms and concepts and medical and biological analogies, respectively, in Papadopoulos's political speeches. Some examples examined in the lexicon component are Revolution, distant past, communism, security. Some examples analysed in the medical and biological component are doctor, infection, cells and the plaster cast.  Clear correlation can be discerned between certain lexical and figurative preferences and audience composition and/or time of delivery; however, while clear lexical and figurative transitions and shifts are noted over the 6-year period, his underlying cyclical narrative is consistently present.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Papadopoulos, Ge&#333;rgios, 1919-</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agent-based approach to dialogue management in personal assistants</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Thuc Anh, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Personal assistants need to allow the user to interact with the system in a flexible and adaptive way such as through spoken language dialogue. This research is aimed at achieving robust and effective dialogue management in such applications. We focus on an application, the Smart Personal Assistant (SPA), in which the user can use a variety of devices to interact with a collection of personal assistants, each specializing in a task domain. The current implementation of the SPA contains an e-mail management agent and a calendar agent that the user can interact with through a spoken dialogue and a graphical interface on PDAs. The user-system interaction is handled by a Dialogue Manager agent.  We propose an agent-based approach that makes use of a BDI agent architecture for dialogue modelling and control. The Dialogue Manager agent of the SPA acts as the central point for maintaining coherent user-system interaction and coordinating the activities of the assistants. The dialogue model consists of a set of complex but modular plans for handling communicative goals. The dialogue control flow emerges automatically as the result of the agent???s plan selection by the BDI interpreter. In addition the Dialogue Manager maintains the conversational context, the domainspecific knowledge and the user model in its internal beliefs.  We also consider the problem of dialogue adaptation in such agent-based dialogue systems. We present a novel way of integrating learning into a BDI architecture so that the agent can learn to select the most suitable plan among those applicable in the current context. This enables the Dialogue Manager agent to tailor its responses according to the conversational context and the user???s physical context, devices and preferences.  Finally, we report the evaluation results, which indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the dialogue model in handling a range of users.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spoken dialogues</field><field name="subject">dialogue management</field><field name="subject">BDI agents</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">natural language processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flame spray synthesis of catalyst nanoparticles for photocatalytic mineralisation of organics and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis</field><field name="creator">Teoh, Wey Yang, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a range of TiO2-based photocatalysts and cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts were developed and synthesised via the one-step Flame Spray Pyrolysis(FSP). The work starts with the demonstration of bare TiO2 nanoparticles synthesis with controlled characteristics such as specific surface areas, crystallite sizes and anatase content. A comparative study was carried out by benchmarking with commercial Degussa P25 TiO2. The FSP TiO2 was shown to be more efficient in mineralising pollutants requiring direct charge transfer such as the saccharides, while P25 was better for mineralising alcoholic and aromatic compounds. Both catalysts were equally as active in mineralising carboxylic acids. Upon identifying the optimal synthesis of bare TiO2, an in situ co-precipitation of highly dispersed Pt on TiO2 was carried out in the flame. Deposition of Pt resulted in enhanced photocatalytic performance as a result of efficient charge trappings. It is highlighted here the inter-relationship between Pt oxidation states and the TiO2photocatalysis of carboxylic acid, alcohol and aromatic compounds. Depending on the mineralisation path adopted by the model organic compounds, they were shown to have direct influence on the Pt oxidation states. These oxidation states in turn affect the mineralisation rates of the organic compounds. Substitutional-doping of TiO2 with Fe(III) with tunable bandgap was also possible by FSP synthesis. The high temperature synthesis coupled with rapid quenching resulted in 5 times higher solubility limit (Fe/Ti = 0.05) than that previously reported in the literature. Under visible light irradiation, FSP-made Fe-TiO2 improved the photocatalytic mineralisation of oxalic acid by more than 6 times, with respect to P25 and FSP TiO2. Furthermore, the photocatalyst was reusable over a number of repetitions with minimal leaching or loss in activity. The last part of the work concerns the development of bare and Ru-doped Co-ZrO2 catalysts, where cobalt was finely dispersed within the zirconia matrix. Doping of Ru enhanced significantly the reducibility of cobalt, reducing even the embedded cobalt beneath the zirconia surface. It also increased the extent of CO-chemisorption and as such, enhanced the FT activity. This is the first time, catalysts of such type is synthesised and tested for FT reaction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flame.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles.</field><field name="subject">Fischer-Tropsch process.</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing dynamic XML data</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Damien Kaine, School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of XML, a markup language for representing semi-structured data. Some of this popularity can be attributed to the success that the semi-structured data model has had in environments where the relational data model has been insufficiently expressive. Concomitant with XMLs growing popularity, the world of database research has seen the rebirth of interest in tree-structured, hierarchical database systems.  This thesis analyzes several problems that arise when constructing XML data management systems, particularly in the case where such systems must handle dynamic content.  In the first chapter, we consider the problem of incremental schema validation, which arises in almost any XML database system.  We build upon previous work by finding several classes of schemas for which very efficient algorithms exist. We also develop an algorithm that works for any schema, and prove that it is optimal.  In the second chapter, we turn to the problem of improving query evaluation times on extremely large database systems. In particular, we boost the performance of the structural and twig joins, fundamental XML query evaluation techniques, through the use of an adaptive index. This index tunes itself to the query workload, providing a 20-80% boost in speed for these join operators.  The adaptive nature of the index also allows updates to the database to be easily tracked.  While accurate selectivity estimation is a critical problem in any database system due to its importance in choosing optimal query plans, there has been very little work on selectivity estimation in the presence of updates. We ask whether it is possible to design a structure for selectivity in XML databases that is updateable, and can return results with theoretically sound error guarantees. Through a combination of lower and upper bounds, we give strong evidence suggesting that this is unlikely in practice.  Motivated by these results, we then develop a heuristic selectivity estimation structure for XML databases. This structure is the first such synopsis that can handle all aspects of core XPath, and is also updateable.  Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">XML.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic.</field><field name="subject">Data.</field><field name="subject">Databases.</field><field name="subject">Semi-structured.</field><field name="subject">Trees.</field><field name="subject">XML (Document markup language)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case for a uniform statutory general anti-avoidance rule in Australian taxation legislation</field><field name="creator">Tooma, Rachel Anne, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Taxpayer certainty is the most frequently cited argument against statutory General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAARs).  However the vast literature criticising statutory GAARs fails to consider the extent of taxpayer uncertainty, and the potential for taxpayer uncertainty, in jurisdictions without a statutory GAAR.  This thesis examines that gap in the literature.  The thesis uses inductive reasoning to suggest that there is greater taxpayer certainty where a statutory GAAR exists and is appropriately administered.  Specifically, it uses a case study to demonstrate that there is greater uncertainty for taxpayers where the administration, the judiciary and the legislature may use their vast powers to address perceived avoidance.  The thesis then considers the form of a statutory GAAR that may best be expected to promote taxpayer certainty.  Such analysis involves a comparison of Australia???s oldest statutory GAAR, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (and its predecessor section 260), with the more recent GAARs in Australia???s indirect tax legislation (GST and state stamp duty), and the GAARs of other jurisdictions, including New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.  In order to promote taxpayer certainty, a uniform statutory GAAR is ultimately proposed for all Australian taxation legislation, with safeguards to ensure the appropriate administration of the uniform GAAR.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxation -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Income tax -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of human motoneurones during voluntary contraction and fatigue</field><field name="creator">Martin, Peter Glen, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">All motor behaviours are expressed via the activation of alpha motoneurones, the final common path of the central nervous system. The corticospinal tract conveys neural information from the motor cortex to motoneurones. This thesis focuses on the corticospinal control of human motoneurones during voluntary contraction and fatigue. First, output of motoneurones to corticospinal inputs is described for a wide range of contraction strengths. Results show that motoneurones become less responsive during strong contractions whereas motor cortical output cells are not limited in the same way. Comparison of motoneurone output to different strength corticospinal inputs and of different motoneurone pools demonstrates an important role for motor unit firing rates in determining the excitability of motoneurones during strong contractions. Next, the reflex actions of group III and IV muscle afferents on motoneurones are investigated. These studies address a long and ongoing debate about the role of these afferents to the slowing of motor unit firing rates during sustained contractions. It was believed that these afferents inhibit motoneurones and contribute to fatigue. However, findings demonstrate that human motoneurones innervating extensor and flexor muscles are not uniformly affected by fatigue-sensitive afferents. Thus afferent inputs from homonymous and antagonist muscles depress extensor motoneurones but facilitate flexor motoneurones. When group III and IV muscle afferents are activated by hypertonic saline, motoneurones of both extensors and flexors are facilitated. This demonstrates parallel excitatory and inhibitory pathways from group III and IV muscle afferents to extensor motoneurones, which are activated under different conditions. Furthermore, the excitation is more pronounced for high-threshold motoneurones. In addition to the effects mediated at motoneurones, activity in group III and IV afferents inhibits motor cortical cells. The final studies investigate changes in the cervical propriospinal pathway with fatigue. This pathway transmits part of the voluntary drive to motoneurones, in parallel with the direct corticospinal pathway. The studies demonstrate that during fatigue, there are coordinated changes in the excitation mediated via this pathway to motoneurones of both fatigued and non-fatigued muscles of the upper limb. In summary, this thesis demonstrates novel aspects of the corticospinal control of motoneurones during voluntary contraction and fatigue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motoneurones.</field><field name="subject">Fatigue.</field><field name="subject">Voluntary contraction.</field><field name="subject">Motor neurons.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes: towards a theory of morphopragmatics</field><field name="creator">Chun, Chong-Hoon, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aim of this thesis is to gain a deep understanding of the meanings of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes from a pragmatic viewpoint, using real, not constructed data. In order to attain the purpose, this thesis conducts an in-depth analysis of the nature of the meanings, and the use, of six Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes: -ko, -nuntey, -nikka, -se, -ciman, and -to. The term the use refers to the truth-functionality of suffixes, i.e., whether they conjoin or disjoin the two propositions, which are recovered from two segments, truth-functionally. The data are obtained from 360 minutes of audio-taped Korean natural conversations. It adopts as its reasoning tool four major pragmatic theories - Gricean theory, neo-Gricean theory, Relevance Theory, and Default Semantics. However, it does not use the data to compare the four theories. The thesis emphasises how to elucidate the meanings of Korean conjunctive verbal suffixes that modern pragmatic theories cannot neatly explain. In Chapter 1 previous approaches on the six suffixes are analysed. It is pointed out that while these studies correctly equate the meanings of a given suffix with propositional relations that obtain between the two segments (linked by the suffix), they fail to see the importance of the use of the suffix. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the four pragmatic theories. The focus is on strengths and weaknesses of the four theories. In Chapter 3, we introduce propositional relations and the notions of encoding and inferred. What is meant by conjoining and disjoining truth-conditionally is also explained. Chapter 4 specifies the data. In Chapter 5, propositional relations between two propositions which are recovered from two conjoined segments are characterised. Chapter 6 applies the scope test to meanings of the six suffixes and distinguishes encoded and inferred meanings. It discusses encoded meanings of the six suffixes, which conjoin the two propositions truth-functionally, and discusses inferred meanings of only four of the six suffixes, which disjoin the two propositions truthfunctionally. In Chapter 7, we discuss the nature of the meanings of the six suffixes from two theoretical angles, Relevance Theory and Default Semantics, and in particular we argue against a unitary procedure hypothesis. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis and also includes suggestions for future studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean language -- Suffixes and prefixes.</field><field name="subject">Pragmatics.</field><field name="subject">Grammar, Comparative and general.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated feature recognition system for supporting engineering activities downstream of conceptual design.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Timothy, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transfer of information between CAD models and downstream manufacturing process planning software typically involves redundant user interaction. Many existing tools are process-centric and unsuited for selection of a  "best process" in the context of existing concurrent engineering design tools. A computer based Feature-Recognition (FR) process is developed to extract critical manufacturing features from engineering product CAD models. FR technology is used for automating the extraction of data from CAD product models and uses wire-frame geometry extracted from an IGES neutral file format. Existing hint-based feature recognition techniques have been extended to encompass a broader range of manufacturing domains than typical in the literature, by utilizing a combination of algorithms, each successful at a limited range of features. Use of wire-frame models simplifies product geometry and has the potential to support rapid manufacturing shape evaluation at the conceptual design stage. Native CAD files are converted to IGES neutral files to provide geometry data marshalling to remove variations in user modelling practice, and to provide a consistent starting point for FR operations. Wire-frame models are investigated to reduce computer resources compared to surface and solid models, and provide a means to recover intellectual property in terms of manufacturing design intent from legacy and contemporary product models. Geometric ambiguity in regard to what is ?solid? and what is not has plagued wire-frame FR development in the past. A new application of crossing number theory (CNT) has been developed to solve the wire-frame ambiguity problem for a range of test parts. The CNT approach works  satisfactorily for products where all faces of the product can be recovered and is tested using a variety of mechanical engineering parts.  Platform independent tools like Extensible Mark-up Language are used to capture data from the FR application and provide a means to separate FR and decision support applications. Separate applications are composed of reusable software modules that may be combined as required. Combining rule-based and case-based reasoning provides decision support to the manufacturing application as a means of rejecting unsuitable processes on functional and economic grounds while retaining verifiable decision pathways to satisfy industry regulators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Expert systems (Computer science) -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="subject">CAD/CAM systems.</field><field name="subject">Computer integrated manufacturing systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network mobility management for next generation mobile systems</field><field name="creator">Perera, Algamakoralage Eranga Gayani, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The future Internet will need to cater for an increasing number of powerful devices and entire groups of networks to roam in heterogeneous access networks. The current approach towards meeting such requirements, which is to retrofit mobility solutions to different layers of the protocol stack, has given rise to an increasingly fragmented network control layer. Furthermore, retrofitting solutions in an ad-hoc manner to the protocol stack does not provide consistent support from the network to different applications. This lack of a common control layer for facilitating roaming in heterogeneous networking environments represents a crucial challenge both technically and from a user perspective. To this end, a novel mobility architecture forms the basis and the first part of this dissertation.  The work on investigating current network mobility solutions and improving these solutions if deemed necessary, in order to reuse within the novel mobility architecture constitutes the second part of this dissertation. The IETF standard protocol for network mobility was implemented and its performance was analysed on a real networking environment. This enabled to identify problems in the standard which affect the handover and routing performance. To address the identified routing and protocol header overheads of the standard network mobility protocol a novel optimal routing framework, OptiNets was proposed. To address the handover latency issues, optimizations to IPv6 network attachment were incorporated and also an access technology independent multiple interface Make-Before-Break handover mechanism was proposed. The viability of the OptiNets framework and the handover optimizations were demonstrated by analysis and by implementation. A more general external factor that affects the performance of mobile networks which is bandwidth scarcity of Wireless Wide Area Networks was addressed, by proposing a bandwidth fuelling architecture for on-board mobile networks. The feasibility of the bandwidth fuelling architecture was analysed by implementing a prototype and evaluating its performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Ambient intelligence.</field><field name="subject">Mobile computing.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Ubiquitous computing.</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propane reforming under carboninduced deactivation: catalyst design and reactor operation</field><field name="creator">Hardiman, Kelfin Martino, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Steam reforming is the most economical and widely-used route for the conversion of light hydrocarbon (such as natural gas) to various valued-added products. This process is commonly carried out over a low-cost alumina-supported nickel catalyst, which often suffers from carbon deposition resulting in loss of active sites, flow and thermal maldistribution, as well as excessive pressure drop.  A bimetallic catalyst with improved anti-coking properties was formulated by incorporating the nickel-based system (15% loading) with cobalt metal (5% loading). Two-level factorial design was employed to investigate the effect of major preparation variables, namely impregnation pH value (2-8), calcination temperature (873-973 K), heating rate (5-20 K min-1) and time (1-5 h).  The catalysts prepared were subjected to various characterisation techniques to determine key physicochemical properties (i.e. BET area, H2-chemisorption and NH3- TPD acidity). X-ray diffraction revealed that NiO, Co3O4, NiCo2O4 and a proportion of Ni(Co)Al2O4 aluminates were transformed during H2-reduction to active Co and Ni crystallites. TEM images showed an egg yolk profile in the low-pH catalyst suggesting that main deposition site was located in the particle centre, while metal deposition occurred primarily around the particle exterior for the high-pH catalyst. Temperature programmed experiments were carried out to examine the extent of conversion, type of surface species and solid-state kinetics (using the Avrami-Erofeev model) involved during various stages in catalyst life-cycle (calcination, reduction, oxidation and regeneration). Steam reforming analysis suggested that enhanced catalyst activity may be due to synergism in the Co-Ni catalyst. Specifically, the low-pH catalyst exhibited better resistance towards carbon-induced deactivation than the high-pH formulation. The study also provided the first attempt to develop a quantitative relation between catalyst preparation conditions and its performance (activity, product selectivity and deactivation) for steam reforming reaction.  Deactivation and reforming kinetic coefficients were simultaneously evaluated from propane reforming conversion-time data under steam-to-carbon ratios of 0.8-1.6 and reaction temperatures between 773-873 K. The time-dependent optimum operational policy derived based on these rate parameters gave better conversion stability despite the heavy carbon deposit. Thermal runs further showed that the catalysts regenerated via two-stage reductive-oxidative coke burn-off exhibited superior surface properties compared to those rejuvenated by a single-step oxidation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Propane.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic reforming.</field><field name="subject">Nickel catalysts.</field><field name="subject">Catalytic cracking.</field><field name="subject">Hydrocarbons.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Injuries, emotions, and stories: Juror decision making and the tort of negligence.</field><field name="creator">Shanahan, Christopher Michael, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Within the framework of the Story Model of juror decision making, using an actual personal injury automobile accident case, this thesis investigated the influence of mock jurors??? emotional response to an injured plaintiff on decisions about defendant liability and the plaintiff???s contributory negligence as well as the efficacy of procedural legal safeguards to control any such biases. Study One validated the Story Model of juror decision making in individual decisions, and revealed that mock jurors failed to consider the requisite legal elements in rendering a verdict. Study Two ascertained participants??? affective response to a mock trial in which evidence relevant to liability was held constant and the severity of the plaintiff???s injuries differed. A multiple mediator model revealed that sympathy for the plaintiff and anger toward the defendant mediated the relation between injury severity and determinations of the relative culpability of the parties. Study Three demonstrated that mock jurors exposed to emotionally evocative damages evidence constructed stories about the defendant???s liability and the plaintiff???s contributory negligence that differed from those constructed in response to emotionally neutral evidence. Study Four showed that the process of group deliberation failed to correct the misuse of evidence relevant to damages in liability decisions. However, Study Five demonstrated that judicial admonitions both acknowledging mock jurors??? emotional response to the evidence and explaining why this response was irrelevant to judgments of liability moderated the influence of emotional states on decisions about liability and contributory negligence. Study Six indicated that jury-eligible citizens??? conceptions of negligence law closely matched the normative model of negligence law, and that their mental models of negligence cases that ended successfully for the plaintiff featured more severely injured plaintiffs than those that ended unsuccessfully for the plaintiff. These studies addressed analytical and methodological weaknesses in previous research, resolved conflicting findings on fusion of liability and damages, provided direct empirical support for the central premise of the Story Model of juror decision making, and advanced knowledge on the influence of emotion on decisions in civil legal cases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making.</field><field name="subject">Jurors.</field><field name="subject">Torts.</field><field name="subject">Negligence.</field><field name="subject">Injuries.</field><field name="subject">Emotion.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sociostructural determinants of diabetes self-management: test of a self-efficacy model.</field><field name="creator">Rose, Vanessa Karen, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Diabetes self-management has clear benefits in reducing diabetes symptoms and complications and improving the health, wellbeing and quality of life of people with diabetes. Successful intervention programs focus on the development of diabetes self-efficacy, which promotes the capacity of people with diabetes to perform diabetes self-management even in the face of difficulty. Diabetes self-management, however, presents considerable challenges for health systems that have been structured to provide acute, rather than chronic care, and health professionals who have been trained to cure illness, rather than manage behaviour. It presents further challenges for people with diabetes who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged circumstances and have limited financial resources for diabetes care and therapies, and poor access to resources for diabetes self-management, such as clean, safe exercise areas and healthy foods at low-cost. These sociostructural determinants of diabetes self-management, defined here as GP care and socioeconomic resources, have the potential to impede the uptake and effective dissemination of diabetes self-management policy and intervention. This research thesis investigated the impact of sociostructural determinants on diabetes self-management using a model developed from self-efficacy theory. The model was empirically examined using a mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology, where qualitative data were used to illuminate the findings of quantitative data. The quantitative component comprised a random cross-sectional survey of 105 people with diabetes subjected to hierarchical multiple regression with tests for moderator effects. The qualitative component comprised three group interviews of 27 English-speaking, Vietnamese-speaking and Arabic-speaking people with diabetes, analysed using the phenomenological method. Findings provided partial support for the model. Relationships between sociostructural determinants and diabetes self-management were complex. While good quality GP care facilitated diabetes self-management, it also acted as a barrier to self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with low levels of diabetes self-efficacy. Having limited access to socioeconomic resources did not impede diabetes self-management, even for people with low levels of diabetes self-efficacy, although this may have been masked by access to public health schemes and welfare support. The findings from this small-scale exploratory study suggest that self-efficacy may exert an impact on diabetes self-management, even in the face of sociostructural determinants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="subject">Self-management (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Self-efficacy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A working man???s hell: working class men's experiences with work in the Australian imperial force during the Great War</field><field name="creator">Wise, Nathan, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historical analyses of soldiers in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the Great War have focused overwhelming on combat experiences and the environment of the trenches. By contrast, little consideration has been made of the non-combat experiences of these individuals, or of the time they spent behind the front lines. Far from military experiences revolving around combat and trench warfare, the letters, diaries, and memoirs of working class men suggest that daily life for the rank and file actually revolved around work, and in particular manual labour. Through a focus on working class men???s experiences in the AIF during the Great War, this dissertation seeks to discover more about these experiences with work in an attempt to understand the broader aspects of life in the military. In this environment of daily work, many working class men also came to approach military service as a job of work, and they carried over the mentalities of the civilian workplace into their daily life in the military. This dissertation thus seeks to understand how workplace cultures were transferred from civilian workplaces into the military. It explores working class men???s approaches towards daily work in two different theatres of war, Gallipoli and the Western Front, in order to highlight the significance of work within military life. Furthermore, it evaluates aspects of this workplace culture, such as relations with employers, the use of workplace skills, and the implementation of industrial relations methods, to understand the continuities between the lives of civilians and soldiers. Finally, this dissertation is not a military history: it adopts a culturalist approach towards the lives of people in the AIF, and in the environment of the Great War, in an effort to place the military experiences of these working class men within the context of their broader civilian lives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Working class men -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Soldiers -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- History, Military.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular events surrounding secretory granule biogenesis in transgenic hormone producing liver cell lines.</field><field name="creator">Lutherborrow, Mark Aaron, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Secretory granule biogenesis describes the events leading up to the budding of a nascent granule from the trans Golgi network. Literature surrounding secretory granule biogenesis is conflicting and has generated much debate. This thesis aims to address the important issues of this debate by utilizing the insulin-producing liver cell line HUH7-ins. This cell line has been shown to synthesize, store and secrete mature insulin in response to glucose via the possession of secretory granules. Using microarray technology the gene expression profile of HUH7-ins cells was compared with parental HUH7 cells, hoping to identify possible candidate genes contributing to secretory granule biogenesis. 164 genes were shown to be differentially expressed although no known granulogenic protein exhibited a change in expression. The data did suggest a nervous system differentiation event and implicates myosin Vc in the regulated secretion of insulin. HUH7-ins cells express a number of granulogenic protein mRNAs and while chromogranin B (CgB) protein level remained constant upon insulin expression, a significant increase in the level of chromogranin A (CgA) was observed, though the significance of this increase in expression is unknown. The over-expression of CgA in a clone of HUH7-ins that did not possess the regulated secretory pathway was unable to rescue the regulated secretory pathway, suggesting that CgA expression alone is unable to form secretory granules in our model. To determine if the secretory granule biogenesis seen in HUH7-ins cells was specific to insulin, three prohormones of different neuroendocrine origin were over-expressed in HUH7 cells; amylin ( cell), pancreatic polypeptide (pancreatic islet) and proopiomelanocortin (pituitary). None of these prohormones were able to form structures in the cytoplasm that resembled secretory granules by immunofluorescent microscopy, nor did they induce the expression of CgA. No prohormone was detected in cell lysates or conditioned media, raising the possibility that these exogenous prohormone aggregates are trafficked to the lysosomal/endosomal system for degradation. This study provides significant information regarding the genome-wide expression changes induced upon secretory granule biogenesis in a liver cell line, describes the lack of effect of CgA in this event and suggests that secretory granule biogenesis in this liver cell line is specific to insulin.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hormones.</field><field name="subject">Liver cells.</field><field name="subject">Life -- Origin.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of the survival of Lactobacillus fermentum PLC in freeze-drying and in subsequent applications</field><field name="creator">Tran, Lai, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactobacillus.</field><field name="subject">Freeze-drying.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tacit assumptions of senior managers</field><field name="creator">Dawes, Keith Harold, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents an investigation into the role that tacit knowledge takes in the mental life of senior managers. The research resulted from the author???s work in New South Wales in facilitating assessment and development centres over a five year period, carried out in collaboration with senior managers from several organizations. A frequent comment made by senior managers was that there seemed to be a gulf between the data obtained objectively from behaviourally measured managerial competencies and the senior managers??? own perceptions of their managerial behaviour. Having earlier researched the role of thought processes out of awareness, the author developed the overall aim of the present study ??? to develop some form of training procedures for senior managers that would enhance the use of tacit processes in their managerial behaviours. The present dissertation begins with a literature review related to the development of understanding of the role of tacit processes in the mental life of senior managers. First a review is presented of investigations of organisational behaviour reported in the literature on tacit knowledge, including issues such as learning, teams, leadership, distributed cognition and culture. Study of the role of tacit knowledge was found to be present in the study of management behaviours and during the process of the present research, related publications increased in frequency. Finally a review is presented of psychological research into the nature of tacit knowledge. This focuses on a range of historical and current views and on the author???s own earlier study of implicit learning carried out in the early 1990???s. Study One is focused on examination of the process of coding tacit assumptions. This begins with documentation of the ontology, epistemology and methodology underpinning this research. Grounded theory, a well-recognised method of qualitative analysis, was selected as most appropriate for this study and its philosophy, rationale and methods are presented. The aim of Study One was to examine the effect of repeated interviews on the codifying of tacit assumptions of senior managers. The initial research was with 13 senior managers, who were interviewed either once or on multiple occasions. The initial interviews of two of these senior managers were analysed as pilot studies, and these analyses are presented in the present dissertation. The main body of this research comprises multiple interviews (five each) carried out with two of the original thirteen senior managers. The results confirmed the importance  of the method of investigation but failed to provide any depth of understanding. Apart from consolidating cognitive closure on a set of managerial competencies, attempting to render tacit knowledge explicit (making the tacit conscious) provided no other significant benefit to the senior managers. The extension of some of these previously tacit assumptions into current cognitive functioning, when coded, assisted in the retention of organisational knowledge but offered no real benefit to the senior managers themselves, no depth of self-knowledge. Study Two arose from a more realistic understanding of tacit processes. The aim of Study Two was to find a way of harnessing the influences of tacit assumptions without trying to surface them ??? to make them ???conscious.??? This is consistent with the writings of such researchers as Nonaka (1991), Baumard (1999) and Spender (2005). By adapting an existing method focusing on subtle mental processes (developed by Norm Kagan in the context of teaching counselling skills and developed further for research first by Diment, Walker and Hammer and then by Sheehan and McConkey ), the author has further developed a technique (The Explicit/Tacit Interface Technique ??? ET~IT) that accesses the tacit processes in the service of the senior manager???s aims. A multiperspective analysis was applied to the feedback interviews of six subjects. This generated a set of characteristics of the ET~IT that hold promise for it to become a useful management development tool. Cohen and Levinthal???s (1990) concept of ???absorptive capacity??? is discussed as a possible starting point for indicating individual differences in successful interfacing with tacit processes. Finally recommendations for further improvement, consideration of constraints and their minimization and methods for evaluating future research into the tacit assumptions of senior managers are presented. Study Two concludes with discussion of how the results can be used as part of senior management development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tacit knowledge.</field><field name="subject">Managers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular insights into the biological role / mechanisms of GATA-4 and FOG-2 in normal cardiac function and in cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="creator">Philips, Alana Sara, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The regulation of cardiac-specific genes such as GATA-4 and its co-factor FOG-2 is paramount for normal heart development and function. Indeed, those mechanisms that regulate GATA-4 and FOG-2 function, such as nuclear transport and the post-translational modification of SUMOylation, are of critical importance for cardiogenesis. Therefore the aims of this study were to: i) elucidate the nuclear transport mechanisms of GATA-4; ii) determine the function of SUMOylation on the biological activity of both GATA-4 and FOG-2; and iii) examine how these mechanisms impact on the role of GATA-4 and FOG-2 in cardiac hypertrophy.  Firstly, we characterised a non-classical nuclear localisation signal that mediates active import of GATA-4 in both HeLa cells and cardiac myocytes. Fine mapping studies revealed four crucial residues within this region that interacted with importin ?? to mediate GATA-4 import via the non-classical import pathway. In addition, a cardiac myocyte-specific CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal, which consists of three essential leucine residues, was identified. We also investigated the residues of GATA-4 that are responsible for its DNAbinding activity and therefore transcriptional control of cardiac-specific genes. Secondly, we demonstrated that SUMOylation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 is exclusively carried out by SUMO-2/3. Moreover, SUMOylation is involved in the nuclear localisation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 in cardiac myocytes as well as the transcriptional regulation of cardiac-specific genes, such as cardiac troponin I. Finally, and perhaps most biologically significant, we showed that nuclear transport as well as SUMOylation of GATA-4 is imperative for the ability of GATA-4 to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, it was determined that FOG-2 SUMOylation is involved in the ability of FOG-2 to protect against cardiac hypertrophy.  In conclusion, the current study provides detailed information on the nuclear transport pathways of GATA-4 as well as the SUMOylation of both GATA-4 and FOG-2 and the role these two mechanisms play in gene transcription and cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac hypertrophy.</field><field name="subject">GATA-4.</field><field name="subject">Nuclear transport.</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation.</field><field name="subject">FOG-2.</field><field name="subject">Genes.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Hypertrophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assortment factors and category performance: an empirical investigation of Australian organic retailing</field><field name="creator">Tan, Lay Peng, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this study is to examine how assortment factors and category performance are related within the context of specialty retailing. This study formulates two clusters of research questions. The first cluster of research questions focuses on product assortment in general, for example assortment variety and composition. The second cluster of research questions concentrates on a specific area of product assortment, that is, private label products. An organic retailer in Australia collaborates by providing its assortment records and sales reports. The Australian organic retailing industry is an ideal candidate for this study for 1) it is specialty retailing, and 2) the supply situation allows organic retailers considerable flexibility to experiment with different assortment compositions.  This study analyses store level cross sub category data and, to supplement this, it conducts a qualitative study and collects field data. Included in the cross sub category analyses are approximately 140 to 180 organic sub categories. The results show that assortment variety has a positive influence on sub category sales.  The strength of this positive relationship varies across different sub category types, for example food or non-food. For the private label analyses, the results show that, within the focal store, private label SKUs are more likely to be present in sub categories with larger sales and with supermarket competition present. This study also finds that a deeper manufacturer brand assortment hurts private label performance.  This study contributes to a body of cross category empirical generalisations about the complex decisions retailers face by examining the effects of assortment decisions within the context of specialty retailing.

Little is known about the ecology of pest rodent species, resulting in much effort being concentrated on ineffective, time consuming control practices. This research was designed to understand the demography and habitat use of the major pest rodent (Rattus tanezumi) of the Banaue rice terraces in order to identify the most efficient time and location to undertake pest control. Rodent crop damage and associated yield loss was also assessed in order to provide information for a cost : benefit analysis of rodent control practices. And the beliefs, perceptions and practices of Banaue rice farmers were investigated to assist in identifying future compatible rodent control programs. Replicated cage trapping was undertaken for a twelve month period over the entire rice cropping season in two study sites in the Municipality of Banaue Philippines. The breeding season of R. tanezumi corresponded with periods of food availability from the transplanted to ripening stages of the rice crop. A non-breeding season occurred from the fallow to seedling stages. The distinct breeding season occurred within the rice fields and adjacent village and scrub habitats. Radio-tracked and spool-and-line tracked R. tanezumi moved from adjacent habitats into the rice field during the breeding season, and individuals persisted in all habitat types, including the rice field, during the fallow, nonbreeding season. Overall rice yield was significantly greater (43%) in areas where rodents were excluded by fencing compared to areas where rodents were not excluded. More rodent damage to rice tillers occurred at the booting than at the ripening stage of the rice crop. These results suggest that to prevent rodent damage, control should be undertaken at the end of the R. tanezumi non-breeding season (prior to transplanting), before rodent numbers multiply and crop damage occurs. Further, the cost-benefit analysis of non-chemical rodent control programs in Banaue, suggests that benefits accrue once yield loss is likely to exceed 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philippines.</field><field name="subject">Rattue tanezumi.</field><field name="subject">Rodent damage.</field><field name="subject">Rodents -- Control.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural pests.</field><field name="subject">Demography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of swept and unswept normal shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction and control by piezoelectric flap actuation</field><field name="creator">Couldrick, Jonathan Stuart, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The interaction of a shock wave with a boundary layer is a classic viscous/inviscid interaction problem that occurs over a wide range of high speed aerodynamic flows. For example, on transonic wings, in supersonic air intakes, in propelling nozzles at offdesign conditions and on deflected controls at supersonic/transonic speeds, to name a few. The transonic interaction takes place at Mach numbers typically between 1.1 and 1.5. On an aerofoil, its existence can cause problems that range from a mild increase in section drag to flow separation and buffeting. In the absence of separation the drag increase is predominantly due to wave drag, caused by a rise in entropy through the interaction.  The control of the turbulent interaction as applied to a transonic aerofoil is addressed in this thesis. However, the work can equally be applied to the control of interaction for numerous other occurrences where a shock meets a turbulent boundary layer. It is assumed that, for both swept normal shock and unswept normal shock interactions, as long as the Mach number normal to the shock is the same, then the interaction, and therefore its control, should be the same.  Numerous schemes have been suggested to control such interaction. However, they have generally been marred by the drag reduction obtained being negated by the additional drag due to the power requirements, for example the pumping power in the case of mass transfer and the drag of the devices in the case of vortex generators. A system of piezoelectrically controlled flaps is presented for the control of the interaction. The flaps would aeroelastically deflect due to the pressure difference created by the pressure rise across the shock and by piezoelectrically induced strains. The amount of deflection, and hence the mass flow through the plenum chamber, would control the interaction. It is proposed that the flaps will delay separation of the boundary layer whilst reducing wave drag and overcome the disadvantages of previous control methods. Active control can be utilised to optimise the effects of the boundary layer shock wave interaction as it would allow the ability to control the position of the control region around the original shock position, mass transfer rate and distribution.  A number of design options were considered for the integration of the piezoelectric ceramic into the flap structure. These included the use of unimorphs, bimorphs and polymorphs, with the latter capable of being directly employed as the flap. Unimorphs, with an aluminium substrate, produce less deflection than bimorphs and multimorphs. However, they can withstand and overcome the pressure loads associated with SBLI control.  For the current experiments, it was found that near optimal control of the swept and unswept shock wave boundary layer interactions was attained with flap deflections between 1mm and 3mm. However, to obtain the deflection required for optimal performance in a full scale situation, a more powerful piezoelectric actuator material is required than currently available.  A theoretical model is developed to predict the effect of unimorph flap deflection on the displacement thickness growth angles, the leading shock angle and the triple point height. It is shown that optimal deflection for SBLI control is a trade-off between reducing the total pressure losses, which is implied with increasing the triple point height, and minimising the frictional losses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock wave</field><field name="subject">boundary layer</field><field name="subject">viscous/inviscid interaction</field><field name="subject">transonic aerofoil</field><field name="subject">drag (aerodynamics)</field><field name="subject">flaps</field><field name="subject">piezoelectric</field><field name="subject">flap actuators</field><field name="subject">unimorphs</field><field name="subject">bimorphs</field><field name="subject">polymorphs</field><field name="subject">deflection</field><field name="subject">swept shock wave</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">pressure sensitive paints</field><field name="subject">shock waves</field><field name="subject">piezoelectricity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the integration of qualitative and quantitative techniques for addressing systemic complexity in the context of organisational strategic decision-making</field><field name="creator">McLucas, Alan Charles, Civil Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">System dynamics modelling has been used for around 40 years to address complex, systemic, dynamic problems, those often described as wicked. But, system dynamics modelling is not an exact science and arguments about the most suitable techniques to use in which circumstances, continues. The nature of these wicked problems is investigated through a series of case studies where poor situational awareness among stakeholders was identified. This was found to be an underlying cause for management failure, suggesting need for better ways of recognising and managing wicked problem situations. Human cognition is considered both as a limitation and enabler to decision-making in wicked problem environments. Naturalistic and deliberate decision-making are reviewed. The thesis identifies the need for integration of qualitative and quantitative techniques. Case study results and a review of the literature led to identification of a set of principles of method to be applied in an integrated framework, the aim being to develop an improved way of addressing wicked problems. These principles were applied to a series of cases in an action research setting. However, organisational and political barriers were encountered. This limited the exploitation and investigation of cases to varying degrees. In response to a need identified in the literature review and the case studies, a tool is designed to facilitate analysis of multi-factorial, non-linear causality. This unique tool and its use to assist in problem conceptualisation, and as an aid to testing alternate strategies, are demonstrated. Further investigation is needed in relation to the veracity of combining causal influences using this tool and system dynamics, broadly. System dynamics modelling was found to have utility needed to support analysis of wicked problems. However, failure in a particular modelling project occurred when it was found necessary to rely on human judgement in estimating values to be input into the models. This was found to be problematic and unacceptably risky for sponsors of the modelling effort. Finally, this work has also identified that further study is required into: the use of human judgement in decision-making and the validity of system dynamics models that rely on the quantification of human judgement.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accidents</field><field name="subject">adaptive toolbox</field><field name="subject">Black Hawk</field><field name="subject">business process re-engineering</field><field name="subject">bounded rationality</field><field name="subject">BPR</field><field name="subject">CATWOE</field><field name="subject">causality</field><field name="subject">causal loop diagram</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">complex strategic problems</field><field name="subject">cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">combat training centre</field><field name="subject">concept mapping</field><field name="subject">decision-making</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">defence preparedness</field><field name="subject">double loop learning</field><field name="subject">dynamic behaviour</field><field name="subject">dynamic complexity</field><field name="subject">feedback</field><field name="subject">feedback loop</field><field name="subject">feedback structure</field><field name="subject">helicopter crash</field><field name="subject">heuristic</field><field name="subject">influence diagram</field><field name="subject">iterative and interactive strategy development</field><field name="subject">IISD</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">Katie Bender</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">managerial cognition</field><field name="subject">defence materiel</field><field name="subject">naturalistic decision making</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">qualitative modelling</field><field name="subject">quantitative modelling</field><field name="subject">recognition-primed decision making</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">root definition</field><field name="subject">Royal Canberra Hospital</field><field name="subject">situation awareness</field><field name="subject">soft systems methodology</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">strategy development</field><field name="subject">system dynamics front-end tool</field><field name="subject">system dynamics modelling</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="subject">systemic problems</field><field name="subject">wicked problems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY: A STUDY OF THE ABSORPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND AN ANALYSIS OF LIBRARIAN'S OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRESENT AND FUTURE IMPACT ON AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES</field><field name="creator">Willard, Patricia, School of Librarianship, UNSW</field><field name="description">The social impacts of new information technology have attracted much attention in recent years.  This study looked at the personal computer's impact on the public library's services and functions.  Particular attention was paid to the public access personal computer.  The method involved a Baseline survey to establish the availability and use of public access personal computers in Australian public libraries and a Delphi survey to consider possible futures.  The researcher's framework was drawn from reviews of the literatures on futures research;  new information technology and its social impacts;  the development and current situation of the public library;  and innovation research.  The Baseline survey revealed that public access personal computers were becoming increasingly common in public libraries, though their provision was not yet widespread.  Existing and planned uses included games, literacy and various other educational activities.  Overall the public access personal computer was viewed as a favourable innovation with the part it could play in developing community computer literacy receiving particular attention.  The Delphi panel was comprised of 25 public librarians selected on the basis of their knowledge about computers in public libraries.  The 41 Event Statements postulated a wide range of changes in - (1) the nature and method of service provision;  (2) the patterns of client demand and use; and,  (3) financial allocations.  The results revealed greater variability of opinion about the likely time of occurrence of the Events than about their desirability. A high level of opinion change between the two Rounds did not produce much movement toward consensus - indicating that the panel had varied views of the future.  Comment on both surveys indicated that the librarians were keen to develop services relevant to their communities and if public access personal computers were such a service they would strive to provide them.  The Delphi survey proved a good vehicle for encouraging consideration of the future and further research using the method seems warranted.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microcomputers</field><field name="subject">automation</field><field name="subject">libraries</field><field name="subject">public libraries</field><field name="subject">personal computers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative microbial risk assessment: a catchment management tool to delineate buffer distances for on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems in Sydney??s drinking water catchments</field><field name="creator">Charles, Katrina, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">On-site sewage systems, such as septic tank-absorption trenches, are used by approximately 20 000 people who live within the catchments that supply Sydney??s drinking water. These systems discharge sewage, treated to varying degrees depending on the system type and level of maintenance, to the environment. This can result in contamination of drinking water supplies if systems are not designed or managed appropriately. The aim of the project was to develop a methodology to define appropriate buffer distances between on-site sewage systems and waterways in Sydney??s drinking water catchments, to ensure the protection of drinking water quality. Specific objectives included: identifying the current status of on-site sewage management; assessing the effluent quality and treatment performance of septic tanks, aerated wastewater treatment systems (AWTS) with disinfection and an amended material sand mound; and development of an appropriate methodology for delineating buffer distances and assessing development applications. Viruses were used as a focus for delineating the buffer distances due to their mobility and robustness in the environment, and the potential health consequences of their presence in drinking water. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) model was developed to calculate the cumulative impact of the on-site sewage systems in the Warragamba catchment based on data from literature and experiments, with consideration of virus loads from sewage treatment plants within the catchments. The model enabled consideration of what was a tolerable impact in terms of the resulting infections within the community. The QMRA the tolerable loads of viruses from the Warragamba catchment were 108 viruses per year in raw water and 104 viruses per year in treated water. A log reduction method was developed to facilitate individual site development assessments. This method was compared to other management approaches to development assessment: fixed minimum buffer distances of 100m, reducing failure rates to zero, and the use of a preferred system. Each of these methods had a limit for how much they could reduce virus loads to the catchment due to either failure or short buffer distances at some sites. While the log reduction method is limited by the failure rates, the method provides a quantitative measure of risk by which maintenance inspections can be prioritised.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buffer</field><field name="subject">septic tank</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">onsite sewage system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment manager trading behaviour and performance</field><field name="creator">Looi, Adrian, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an examination of the trading behaviour of active Australian fund managers. The thesis begins with an analysis of how fund manager trades relate to stock returns in the past, the present, and the future. The dissertation next proceeds to investigating how fund size affects fund performance, trading and portfolio construction. Finally, using earnings announcements as the locus for trading sequences, we analyse the nature of the information used by fund managers to predict stock returns.  This research is presented in the form of three essays. The first essay investigates how active fund manager trades relate to stock returns. Using a unique database of daily transactions from Australian equity managers, we document that our sample of institutional investors exhibit statistically and economically significant predictive power in forecasting future stock returns over the ten days following their trades. Furthermore, detailed analysis indicates that manager style is important in understanding the link between institutional trading and stock returns. The essay finds growth-oriented managers are momentum traders, while style-neutral and value managers are contrarian. Further, the contemporaneous relation between institutional trading and returns depends on trade size, broker use, and investment style. Finally, the study documents that trades and returns are inversely related for value/contrarian managers and directly related for style-neutral and growth managers.  The second essay presents an analysis of how fund size affects investment performance. Recent studies find evidence that small funds outperform large funds. This fund size effect is commonly hypothesized to be caused by transaction costs. Due to the lack of transactions data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is a good proxy for expected market impact.  Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by fund managers to trade. While a number of recent mutual fund performance studies find data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is incurred by small managers. Furthermore, large managers exhibit preferences for trade evidence of outperformance relative to suitably constructed benchmarks, limited research exists as to whether such outperformance is due to privately collected information, or merely expedient interpretation of publicly released information. In this essay an examination of the trade sequences of fund managers around earnings announcements is performed, and evidence is presented revealing an increased Occurrence of buy-sell trade sequences around good announcements and vice versa for bad announcements. The results also show an increase in the frequency of fund managers not trading before announcements, only to subsequently purchase during good announcements. Taken together, this evidence suggests managers are reliant on private information before earnings announcements, as well as them engaging in 'interpretation' of earnings announcements when they do not receive a private signal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business.</field><field name="subject">Managers.</field><field name="subject">Investments.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of natural organic matter</field><field name="creator">Sanly, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Natural organic matter (NOM) occurs ubiquitously in drinking water supplies and is problematic since it serves as a precursor to disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. Stricter DBP regulations will drive utilities to consider advanced treatment processes for DBP control through NOM removal. Herein, the transformation of NOM in homogeneous (UVA/H2O2 and UVA/Fe/H2O2) and heterogeneous (UVA/TiO2) Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) were studied.  Organic matter from three different sources was investigated in this work, specifically a commercial humic acid, and two Australian surface water sources. The transformation of the organic matter as a result of oxidation was investigated through multiple analytical techniques, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, DOC analysis, high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), resin fractionation, liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and disinfection byproducts formation potential. The multi-analysis approach is required due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of NOM. Each analytical technique provides complementary information on different properties of NOM, leading to a comprehensive understanding on how AOPs transform the chemical and physical properties of NOM.  Both homogeneous and heterogeneous AOPs were found to be effective for NOM removal. However, complete mineralisation was not achieved, even under prolonged irradiation. Large aromatic and hydrophobic organics were degraded into lower molecular weight hydrophilic compounds, which had weak UV absorbance at 254 nm. In the UVA/TiO2 treatment, multi-wavelength HPSEC analysis demonstrated the formation of low molecular weight compounds with strong absorbance at wavelength lower than 230 nm. These residual organic compounds, though recalcitrant, had a low reactivity to chlorine to form THMs, and were identified to be low molecular weight acids and neutral compounds from LC-OCD analysis. Finally, the current work reports the novel synthesis of magnetic photocatalyst for NOM oxidation from low cost precursors to solve the separation problem of nano-sized particles. Magnetite particles were coated with a layer of protective silica from sodium silicate precursor. Photoactive titanium dioxide was then deposited onto the silica coated particles using titanium tetrachloride precursor. The as-prepared magnetic photocatalyst exhibited excellent stability and durability. Although the photoactivity of the magnetic photocatalyst is lower than commercial TiO2 photocatalyst, it can be easily recovered by magnetic field.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Natural organic matter</field><field name="subject">Advanced oxidation processes</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax-loss selling and managerial discretion</field><field name="creator">Sherry, Samuel, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between tax-loss selling (TLS), where investors with taxable gains sell stocks that have declined in value just before the fiscal year-end to generate offsetting tax losses, and managers?? incentives to influence stock prices, either through increased disclosure or by engaging in upwards earnings management. Firms whose stock prices represent greater potential tax losses in investors?? portfolios at year-end are predicted to increase their disclosure level in June to prevent further share price falls due to TLS, and have higher levels of accruals. Using the number of discretionary, market-sensitive news releases in the Signal G announcement database to measure disclosure frequency, this thesis finds that, for a sample of 14,713 firm-year observations drawn from all ASX firms for the years 1994 to 2007, stocks with larger negative returns have higher disclosure in June, after controlling for size, performance, risk and external financing dependence. This is particularly true of small mining and exploration companies that are more reliant on voluntary disclosure as a vehicle for lowering information asymmetry. This increased disclosure does not appear to contribute to the higher July returns earned by stocks that experienced significant TLS in June. Disclosure frequency is negatively associated with the magnitude of operating and total accruals, suggesting that earnings management is less likely for firms with higher disclosure. There is also evidence that smaller firms with poor stock price performance have higher levels of operating accruals and thus may be more likely to engage in earnings management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">earnings management</field><field name="subject">tax loss selling</field><field name="subject">discretionary disclosure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The best laid plans: medical students' responses to new curricula</field><field name="creator">Balasooriya, Chinthaka Damith, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether a carefully designed educational program can impact unfavourably on a proportion of students, what the magnitude of this proportion may be, whether previously identified ???deep enhancing??? features could stimulate surface approaches in some students, and the possible reasons for such paradoxical impact. These questions are set within a context of continuing efforts to find the ???ideal??? medical curriculum, and where evaluation studies of these curricular methods have failed to demonstrate the expected degree of positive impact. This leads to the final question of the thesis, which is whether the phenomenon of different responses by different students, could help explain the less-than-expected positive impact of curricular innovations reported in the literature. The questions were explored through a series of three studies. The First study consisted of individual student interviews and surveys (using the R-SPQ-2F, Biggs et al 2001) during a traditional program in medicine and upon conclusion of an educational program designed along currently accepted principles associated with higher quality learning outcomes. The two follow up studies included surveying students in two other settings in medical education. These studies were useful to overcome some of the limitations of the First study, and to explore the possible wider prevalence of the findings of the First study. The findings of the First study indicated that one-third of the student group did respond unfavourable to a carefully designed educational program. The interview findings highlighted this phenomenon, and illustrated how these students responded to ???deep enhancing curricular features??? by changing to more surface approaches. The survey findings supported these findings, and helped cluster and categorise students into subgroups who responded to the Pilot program in distinct ways. The two follow up studies indicated similar patterns of response in the other settings of medical education, and suggested that this phenomenon may be more widely prevalent. The findings suggest an area of research that requires further exploration. If confirmed and extended by further work, the findings could have significant theoretical and practical implications for medical education. From a theoretical perspective, the findings enrich the current theory of student approaches to learning by beginning to unravel the complex interaction between student and context factors that lead to approaches. The thesis further contributes to the literature by its finding that some previously identified ???deep enhancing??? context factors could stimulate change to more surface approaches in some students, and by the finding that different students??? approaches could change in different directions, when measured before and after the same ???deep enhancing??? educational context. From a practical perspective, the findings could be relevant to designers and evaluators of medical curricula, and to facilitators of small group learning. An understanding of the different patterns of response that may be expected, and an understanding of different strategies that may better support these different subgroups, may help optimise the benefits of curricular design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical education</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">medical students</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersubjectivity and learning: a socio-semantic investigation of classroom discourse</field><field name="creator">Jones, Pauline, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the shaping of pedagogic subjectivities through classroom talk. It addresses a number of research questions, namely: In what ways do forms of intersubjectivity created in classroom talk shape the learning for children in two socioeconomically disadvantaged classrooms? How do teachers??? variant readings of official curriculum documents impact on classroom practices? How might the role of the teacher in such classrooms be usefully understood and articulated? The research described in the thesis draws on socio-cultural approaches to language, learning and pedagogy. Systemic functional linguistics, which models cognition as meaning, provides the major theoretical position together with tools for close linguistic analysis (Halliday 1994, 1999). Vygotsky???s complementary view of learning as the consequence of joint activity in semioticised environments highlights the role of the mediating agent (1978). Bernstein???s theory of pedagogic relations provides a useful framework for understanding the circulation of cultural dynamics through locally situated pedagogic settings (1990, 1996, 2000). The research adopts a case study approach; data comprises talk produced during a complete curriculum cycle in each primary classroom as well as interviews, written texts and official curriculum documents. The analysis proceeds through phases; that is, it initially describes the curriculum macrogenres (Christie 2002) then moves to more detailed linguistic analyses of prototypical texts from each setting. Mood, speech function and appraisal (Eggins &amp; Slade 1997, Martin &amp; Rose 2003) are systems recognised in the SFL model as those which enact intersubjective relations. Close attention to their deployment in classroom interactions reveals much about how broad social roles are enacted, how the moral regulation of the learners is accomplished and how subtle differences in learning take place. The analysis reveals considerable difference in the educational knowledge under negotiation. In one classroom, learners are stranded in localised, everyday discourses; while in the other, learners are given access to more highly valued curriculum discourses. It is argued that the interactive practices which produce such difference result from teachers??? readings of the official curriculum; readings which are shaped by particular philosophical orientations to curriculum, together with features of the local settings and their relations to the official pedagogic field.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intersubjectivity</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">discussion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the problem of individuation: Mitsein (being-with), ethics and responsibility</field><field name="creator">Sorial, Sarah, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The argument of this thesis is that Heideggerian individuation does not constitute another form of solipsism and is not incongruent with Heidegger???s account of Mitsein (beingwith). By demonstrating how individuation is bound up with Mitsein I will also argue that this concept of individuation contains an ethics, conceived here as responsibility for one???s Being/existence that nevertheless implicates others. By tracing the trajectory of Heidegger???s thinking from Being and Time to the later text, Time and Being, I want to suggest that the meditation on Being and its relation to Dasein as an individual contains an ethical moment. Ethics, not conceived of as a series of proscriptions, in terms of the Kantian Categorical Imperative for example. Nor ethics conceived in terms of an obligation to and responsibility for another, as in Levinasian ethics, but an ethics in terms of responsibility for existence, and more specifically, for one???s own existence. The ethical moment in Heidegger, I argue, is not one as ambitious as changing the world or assuming infinite and numerous obligations on behalf of others. It is, rather, a question of changing oneself. It is a question of assuming responsibility in response to the call of Being. I will show how, given that Dasein is always Mitsein, others are situated in such an ethics. Central to the thesis is an examination of the relation between indivduation and Mitsein. While Heidegger is always careful to distinguish his form of individuation from other accounts of individuation or solipsism, such as those of Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant or Edmund Husserl???s, Heidegger???s conception of solipsism and its relation to his account  of Mitsein remains somewhat obscure. As a consequence, there are several problems that this concept raises, all of which have been the subject of much debate. At the centre of this debate is the apparent tension between the concept of individuation and the notion that ontologically, Dasein is also a Mitsein. This tension has led to a number of interpretations, which either argue that the concept of individuation is inconsistent with the notion of Mitsein, or that it constitutes yet another instance of Cartesian subjectivity and that as a consequence, it is inherently unethical. This thesis contributes to this debate by submitting that the concept of individuation, while primary or central to Heidegger???s ontology, is not in tension with his account of Mitsein. I use Jean-Luc Nancy???s paradoxical logic of the singular to argue for this claim. I suggest that it is precisely this concept of individuation that can inform an ethics and theory of political action on account of the emphasis on individual responsibility. The second part of my argument, also made with the aid of Nancy, is that this can inform an ethics and a theory of political action, not at level of making moral judgements, or yielding standards of right and wrong, but at the level of individual and by implication, collective responsibility for one???s own existence. Given that there is no real separation between the ontic and ontological levels in Heidegger???s work, a taking responsibility at the level of one???s own Being will invariably play itself out ontically in factical life in terms of moral responsibility and judgement. I explore the concrete political implications of this through an examination of Heidegger???s account of freedom. I argue that Heidegger???s removal of freedom from the  ontology of self-presence and his alternative conception of it provides us with a way of thinking freedom not in terms of a specific set of rights, but as a mode of being-in-theworld and as the basis for collective political action. I use the work of Hannah Arendt to develop a theory of political action, freedom and judgment from this revisionary conception of freedom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gras development, approval and implementation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Ely, William Stewart, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This Thesis covers the development of an alternative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation technology that has become known as the Ground-based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS). GNSS augmentation technologies in support of aviation have largely been developed by countries with large economies such as the USA and members of the European Union. These technologies have focussed on solutions to the specific problems of the host nations, based on the demographics, political and economic factors relevant to them. Outside these countries, the role of GNSS augmentation has largely been ignored, specifically when considering wide area augmentation utilising Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). SBAS technologies are expensive, and cannot be justified for nations like Australia with a relatively small number of aircraft, operated in a focussed geographic area. Utilising SBAS services provided by another country introduces cultural, legal and institutional issues that are not always easily addressed. GRAS was derived to provide a cost-effective wide area augmentation capability to nations that lacked the economic ability to field SBAS technologies. This work covers the evolution of the GRAS concept, the construction and testing of the GRAS test bed and its associated test avionics, as well as the development of standards needed to support GRAS as an internationally accepted aviation standard. The major outcome from this work was the confirmation that GRAS could meet the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) standards for Approaches with Vertical Guidance Level 2 (APV-II) as well as all less demanding modes of flight. Results from numerous ground and flight tests conducted under this research program have been reviewed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) GNSS Panel (GNSSP), and been instrumental in the development and validation of Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) which promulgate how ICAO standardised systems should perform. The final component of this work describes the project management and technology approval processes needed to get an internationally standardised system into operational use, and the particular problems that a small country like Australia has in progressing these tasks on the World stage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation</field><field name="subject">Navigation (Aeronautics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implantable surgical devices issues of product liability</field><field name="creator">Higgs, Robin JED, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patients who have undergone treatment that has included the surgical implantation of a prosthetic device can become dissatisfied for many reasons. One cause for dissatisfaction is any adverse event where there is a demonstrable causal nexus with the failure of a device that is defective or at risk of being so. The magnitude of therapeutic product failure is considerable and therapeutic goods such as Vioxx, Thalidomide, silicon-gel-filled breast implants, contaminated blood products, cardiac pacemakers and valves, and orthopaedic devices are testimony to this. Many of these events have exposed a greyish area of Australian law that balances medical negligence with consumer protection and contract law. Australian product liability legislation that regulates the use of therapeutic goods is a complex amalgam of law that has at its foundations the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth). When a surgical device fails there can be exposure to liability. This thesis explores those important issues that can impact on individuals or on organisations and it is evident that where issues of product liability concern implanted surgical devices the current regulations for consumer protection may not always be the most appropriate. It is evident that there is a culture of under-reporting of adverse events to a Therapeutic Good Administration that does not have the resources to investigate the cause for failure of a surgical device. Furthermore, there is a potential for bias and conflict of interest in an environment where the regulator depends on the regulated for the funding of its existence. Other issues include the complex and often undesirable consequences of those partnerships that can evolve with the development of an implantable device and with the undertaking of clinical trials, the role of the learned intermediary, that interface between manufacturer and consumer, and the role of the expert witness, that interface between justice and injustice. These and other matters that can significantly influence any debate of implantable surgical device product liability are explored and recommendations are made that might form the basis of a Therapeutic Goods (Safe Medical Devices) Amendment Act.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surgical instruments and apparatus</field><field name="subject">Implants, Artificial</field><field name="subject">Contract -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Consumer protection -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Product liability -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lonergan&#8217;s Intentionality Analysis and the Foundations of Organization and Governance: a response to Ghoshal</field><field name="creator">Little, John David</field><field name="description">The thesis explores the nature of organization and governance by applying a method of intentionality analysis as elaborated by the Canadian philosopher and theologian, Bernard Lonergan, in his two monumental works, Insight &#8211; a study of human understanding, and Method in Theology. The project arose from the writer&#8217;s own experience in management education and consultancy. Admittedly, intentionality analysis has not been a major theme in the management literature. However, the late Sumantra Ghoshal drew attention to the consequences of neglecting the dimension of intentionality in business education and management theory, such consequences as unethical practices and even the collapse of corporations, as was the case with Enron. In a paper published by the Academy of Management Learning and Education in 2005, Ghoshal raised a number of crucial and epistemological questions, though he offered no easy answers. In the effort to rise to Ghoshal&#8217;s challenge, this thesis argues that Lonergan&#8217;s method of intentionality analysis opens new ways to approach the theory and practice of management. It thereby suggests a model relevant to all managerial tasks. Hence, it repeatedly stresses the value of asking questions and of attending to data. It indicates what is involved in the understanding of a given situation, in the making of judgments based on experience, and in the deciding on particular courses of action. In so doing, the thesis clarifies a number of intricate epistemological questions, while emphasising throughout, the vital role of self-knowledge and self-possession. The thesis is essentially a step-by-step discussion of the various elements in intentionality analysis in the context of corporate management. Hence, for the sake of brevity, it designates its &#8220;intentionality analysis method&#8221; with the acronym, IAM (and in reference to organisational operations, IAMO). To illustrate various aspects of intentionality analysis for the purposes of management education, the author draws on exercises previously used in his involvement in executive workshops. The usefulness of the IAM developed in this thesis is highlighted by comparing and contrasting it with selected management theories on learning and strategy as found in the writings of, for example, Belbin, Janis, Kegan, Revans, Argyris, Nonaka, Takeuchi, Senge, Mintzberg, Ansoff, Lewis and Jaques. The project concludes with a discussion of the pedagogical challenges involved in presenting such material to managers, with reference to some contemporary developments in business education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Business education</field><field name="subject">Intentionality analysis method</field><field name="subject">Bernard Lonergan</field><field name="subject">Sumantra Ghoshal</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp210.18082009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resituating the meaning of occupation in the context of living</field><field name="creator">Reed, Kirk</field><field name="description">This study explores the meaning of occupation, defined as a &#8220;conceptual entity&#8230; [which] includes all the things that people do in their everyday life&#8221; (Sundkvist &amp; Zingmark, 2003, p. 40). Using a phenomenological hermeneutic method informed by the writings of Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), this study provides an understanding of the meaning of occupation interpreted from the perspective of 12 New Zealand adults who experienced a disruption to their occupations. The review of the literature suggests that early writers from the time of the Bible identified that occupation is not &#8216;wide open&#8217;, there are many factors that shape how and when a person engages in an occupation, which in turn shapes the meaning of occupation. Within the occupational therapy literature, discussion of the meaning of occupation is overshadowed by describing and defending practice. In occupational science scholars and researchers have focused largely on understanding occupation from a conceptual perspective rather than the ontological meaning of occupation. The exploration of the meaning of occupation is being advanced by only a few. In this study participants told their stories about their occupations. Data were analysed by indentifying key themes and engaging in a hermeneutic thinking process of going back to the work of Heidegger and Gadamer. Writing and re-writing was the method used to bring new understandings to the data. The findings of this thesis suggest that the meaning of occupation is complex, and tends to remain hidden. Analysis focuses on the call, Being-with, and possibilities. The call to occupation seems to be in response to what it is we care about or what concerns us. Being-with others while engaging in an occupation creates a bond and mood; the meaning of occupation changes depending on who the occupation is done with or without. The meaning of occupation is also revealed in the possibilities that are opened up or closed down. Occupation shows both ourselves and others what it is we are capable of in the journey of who it is we are becoming. Each of these facets of meaning work in unison and can be likened to three cogs in a wheel, each interconnected with the others. The thesis concludes by recognising that not all voices have been heard and argues for uncovering more about the meaning of occupation from the perspective of lived experience. A challenge is made to consider the meaning of occupation not as something that is individually derived but as something that is connected to the broader context of the world and others in the world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational science</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Health studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RugbySmart: the development, delivery and evaluation of a nationwide injury prevention programme</field><field name="creator">Quarrie, Kenneth Lincoln</field><field name="description">This thesis represents my research work relating to rugby union from 2000 to 2007. During this time I was the Manager of Injury Prevention and Research for the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU). The main priorities of this role were to increase understanding of risk factors for rugby injury, to implement preventive measures, and to assess the effect of those preventive measures. The thesis is presented as a series of peer-reviewed, published papers. A key concern of the NZRU when I undertook the role was to decrease the number and severity of spinal cord injuries occurring in New Zealand rugby. The first paper is a review of literature of rugby union injuries to the cervical spine and spinal cord. This paper was published in Sports Medicine, and the knowledge derived there from formed an important element in RugbySmart, which was the nationwide injury prevention partnership between the NZRU and ACC. The second paper, which was published in the British Medical Journal, outlines the effect of RugbySmart on serious spinal injuries in New Zealand. Eight spinal injuries occurred in New Zealand in 2001-2005, whereas the predicted number based on previous incidence was 19 (relative rate 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.14). The main reason for the decline was a decrease in the number of injuries from scrums, from a predicted number of nine only one was observed (relative rate 0.11; 0.02 to 0.74). Injury prevention initiatives in New Zealand appear to have been successful in areas beyond spinal injuries. The third paper deals with the effect of RugbySmart in general. RugbySmart was associated with a decrease in injury claims per 100,000 players in most areas the programme targeted; the programme had negligible impact on non-targeted injury sites. The decrease in injury claims numbers was supported by results from player behaviour surveys pre- and post-RugbySmart. There was an increase in safe behaviour in the contact situations of tackle, scrum and ruck technique. The fourth paper, which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examines the effect of mandating mouth guard usage on mouth guard wearing rates and ACC dental injury claim rates. The self reported rate of mouth guard use was 67% of player-weeks in 1993 and 93% in 2003. A total of 2644 claims were reported in 1995. There was a 43% (90% confidence interval 39% to 46%) reduction in dental claims from 1995 to 2003. On the reasonable assumption that the number of players and player-matches remained constant throughout the study period, the relative rate of injury claims for non-wearers versus wearers was 4.6 (90% confidence interval 3.8 to 5.6). In New Zealand the tackle is the facet of play associated number of injuries, and over the past decade tackles have overtaken scrums as the cause of the greatest proportion of spinal injuries. To address the lack of knowledge regarding risk factors for injuries in the tackle, a large scale study of tackles in professional rugby matches was undertaken. In 434 matches, over 140,000 tackles were coded. The impact of the tackle was the most common cause of injury, and the head was the most common site, but an important mechanism of lower limb injuries was loading with the weight of another player. Rates of replacement increased with increasing player speed. The resulting paper was published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. A commonly cited model of injury causation in sport posits that risk factors for injury can be considered as those related to the athlete (intrinsic) and those related to the activity (extrinsic). To examine the extent to which the activities comprising rugby matches at the international level has changed over time the first match in each Bledisloe Cup series from 1972 to 2004 was coded. Increases in passes, tackles, rucks, tries, and ball-in-play time were associated with the advent of professionalism, whereas there were reductions in the numbers of lineouts, mauls, kicks in play, and in mean participation time per player. Noteworthy time trends were an increase in the number of rucks and a decrease in the number of scrums. With the advent of professionalism, players have become heavier and backs have become taller.  A number of articles written to communicate injury prevention messages to rugby union coaches, players and administrators are presented as appendices, along with two peer reviewed papers that closely relate to the thesis, but which I excluded from the thesis proper.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rugby</field><field name="subject">Injuries</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Mouth guards</field><field name="subject">Accident Compensation Corporation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shaping of decision-making in governance in the New Zealand Public Healthcare Services</field><field name="creator">Mathias, Wanda Lee</field><field name="description">The study explores what shapes decision-making in governance in the New Zealand public healthcare services. It contributes to the understanding of the impact of the beliefs, perceptions and roles of the decision-makers and the tensions in public healthcare services in New Zealand. The focus was on ascertaining the characteristics of the people as individuals and as members of groups, their skills, preparation and the experience required to make governance decisions in healthcare services in New Zealand. The research analysed data from interviews with individuals in senior positions in public healthcare services in New Zealand, focus groups made up from those individuals and observations of formal District Health Board (DHB) meetings. The context for the study is the New Zealand public healthcare services within the DHB model. This study focuses on the organisational and operational aspects of governance from the socio-anthropological viewpoint of Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology was chosen as it highlights the interaction of power and the management of tension between individuals and groups in different, but abutting, fields of practice. Using Bourdieu&#8217;s methodology the researcher has placed healthcare services in an economy of political power where the capital individuals and groups bring to an environment is demonstrated through their power and influence within a particular field of practice. In this study the field of practice is governance in New Zealand public healthcare services. The method involved purposive sampling of participants from three DHBs. The participants included appointed and elected members, chairmen, chief executives and senior clinicians from medical and nursing cohorts. The participants identified 22 abstracts which determined the shape of their decision-making. Through analysis and reflection these 22 determinants were organised into groups reflecting the generic principles of governance identified in the literature. The study concludes that decision-making in governance is shaped by the concepts of professional maturity, quality and safety, power and tension and fiduciary duty within the context of structure and time. The scope of governance is connected across healthcare organisations by the tension of power manifested through the capital individuals and groups bring to the interaction or field of practice. The study also found that there are two aspects to decision-making in governance which allow transferability of the concepts of governance across healthcare service organisations. Firstly, governance is decision-making in good faith with independence of mind and with the appropriate skills, diligence and care on behalf of others. Secondly, the structures of governance operationalised in audit, laws, guidelines, codes and principles support the decision-making on behalf of others. Consequently, the rules of decision-making in governance in healthcare services are the same whether the decision is being made in a clinical or corporate environment. They are enacted differently because of the different contexts. The study brings together the determinants in their concept groups into a framework in the context of structure and time. Use of the framework will enable those with governance responsibilities to shape their governance decision-making from an informed and common base which recognises the tensions in the field of healthcare services governance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="subject">Health care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual abuse prevalence and association with adverse labour and birth outcomes</field><field name="creator">Fyfe, Elaine Maria</field><field name="description">In the past decade there has been growing recognition that a sexual abuse history may manifest during health care examinations. More recently, awareness has been raised about a possible link between a history of sexual abuse and traumatic labour and birth. It is theoretically likely that the intimacy of labour and birth for women with a history of sexual abuse may trigger post-traumatic stress symptomatology. In this cross sectional study, a survey method was used to establish prevalence of sexual abuse and to measure obstetric outcomes, birth experience and birth trauma in a cohort of women who have recently given birth and to test whether there are associations between sexual abuse and birth outcomes. Eighty-five women whose 3&#189; to 5 year old children attend kindergarten participated. Lifetime sexual abuse was found to be a common experience for study participants. One out of every three women disclosed an experience of sexual abuse in her lifetime. A history of sexual abuse was not associated with adverse labour and birth outcomes; however women with a positive sexual abuse history were more likely to report postnatal depression. A quarter of the women had PTSD symptoms but overall, women had positive birth experiences and felt well supported. Many women are able to overcome traumatic abuse experiences and successfully cope with birth, an event that may potentially replicate the dynamics of sexual abuse. Further research is needed to identify women who may be at high risk for traumatic birth experiences. Undertaking screening for sexual abuse in the antenatal period in a safe environment may provide reassurance for women and enable identification of those women at high risk for abuse related traumatic birth experiences.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="subject">Labor (Obstetrics)</field><field name="subject">Childbirth</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of biodiversity databases in coastal conservation and resource management</field><field name="creator">Palacio, Monalisa</field><field name="description">Marine environmental resource managers and consultants require comprehensive, accurate and current data on the status of marine biodiversity in order to fully evaluate resource consent applications that involve development, impact or encroachment within the marine environment, and for identifying areas of coast appropriate for conservation. The role and efficacy of existing global, national and regional marine biodiversity databases in delivering these types of data are evaluated. Consultation with environmental consultants revealed that none regularly, if ever used any existing marine biodiversity database during their routine consulting activities. Moreover, no existing biodiversity database had appropriate data-mining tools, although each was determined to provide information of value to resource managers and environmental consultants operating at national and regional scales; none was deemed to provide the sort of information required to manage marine resources at a local scale. To achieve the objectives of this research programme, resource managers, data users and data compilers were consulted to determine their ideal data and database requirements. Existing biodiversity data sets that included New Zealand marine biodiversity then were searched or procured, and these data and that of a novel data set of species occurring at 296 intertidal and 25 fringe-saline (effectively freshwater) sites within and proximal to the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park (from Mimiwhangata Bay in the north to Tauranga Harbour in the south) were compared with species inventories from environmental consultants operating in this region. Biodiversity data from the 296 saline, comprising presence/absence data for 713 taxa recorded from the survey region were analysed in detail. Significantly different species assemblages were identified amongst these 296 sites, five intertidal habitats being recognised, each with characteristic species assemblages: marine-hard shores, marine-soft shores, brackish-hard shores, brackish-soft shores, and mangrove shores. Species richness and diversity were consistently higher in marine habitats, and greatest on hard substrata. Most sites host unique assemblages of species. A novel index of species richness is proposed, and although the spatial distribution of richness isn&#8217;t particularly revealing, as obvious patterns in the distribution of richness are not apparent, this index has value in that the richness of any shore can be compared and contrasted with that of others throughout the region. Augmenting this richness index is a novel index of species rarity. Based on the frequency of occurrence of taxa on shores throughout the survey region, very rare through to ubiquitous taxa are recognised to routinely occur on almost all shores, regardless of the total species richness. Moreover, very rare to uncommon taxa often comprise a disproportionately high percentage of the total species occurring on any given intertidal shore, in any habitat. Accordingly, alarm bells should ring for reviewers of resource consent applications wherein environmental consultants state that an area subject to development &#8216;hosts no rare, unique or otherwise remarkable species or ecology.&#8217;  Two applications of these novel biodiversity data are demonstrated: the relationship between species richness and regional council consented activities is described, with a negative correlation reported for the intensity of disturbance (using the number of consented activities as a proxy for disturbance) and species richness on marine hard shores; and an appraisal of four selection criteria for marine reserves (naturalness, representativeness, uniqueness and complementarities), wherein the intertidal fauna and flora of no existing or proposed marine reserve appears to be  natural, unique or representative, and effort seems to have been spent duplicating certain assemblages of species in reserve networks. The former is intuitively obvious, but the latter is alarming, and the ramifications of it far reaching in terms of conservation of the marine environment. Protocols for conducting biodiversity surveys must be established and implemented to elevate the standards of environmental consultants, resulting value judgements on the composition of species, and the likely and actual effects of these developments on the marine environment to ensure that statements made in reports are based on current data rather than perceptions and client expectations. It is possible that resource consents have been issued based on spurious appraisals of the immediate and cumulative effect of discharge on the environment, or of the relative rarity (or appreciation of this) of species that occur within it. Prior to development of the novel Monalisa data set, no existing database or data set existed that provided the information routinely required by managers and consultants to make informed judgements that affect coastal development throughout the survey region.

Rural Tourism encompasses a huge range of activities, natural or manmade attractions, amenities and facilities, transportation, marketing and information systems (Sharpley &amp; Sharpley, 1997). Rural tourism is very diverse and fragmented in terms of operational structures, activities, markets and operating environments (Roberts &amp; Hall, 2001, citing Pearce, 1989). Benefits of rural tourism have been expressed as employment growth and broadening a region&#8217;s economic base, repopulation, social improvement, and revitalization of local craft (Sharpley, 2000). Governments can play active roles in tourism. In short the literature suggests rural tourism development policy approaches require: regeneration/revitalization, horizontal and vertical integration, interdependence, stewardship/sustainability, mediation, cataclysm, service and welfare provisions, spatiality &#8211; awareness, intra and inter regional complementariness, opportunism, realism and quality (Roberts &amp; Hall, 2001). Murphy (1985) proposed a community approach to tourism development which included formation of businesses networks, and the sharing of resources and information. For rural tourism to be successful, collaboration needs to exist amongst entrepreneurs (Wilson et al., 2001). Useful integrated approaches to rural studies include acknowledging the importance of locally controlled agendas to reach centralization, awareness of the benefits for shared ideas and funding developments, and creating appropriate tourism plans for rural areas (MacDonald &amp; Jolliffe, 2003). There are numerous challenges when attempting rural tourism development: the total product package must be sufficient; significant investment may be required; there is the adaption to a service role; the quality of products and services and the availability of skills and resources for effective marketing (Sharpley, 2000). Tourism development requires attractions, promotion, infrastructure and services and hospitality (Wilson et al., 2001, citing Gunn, 1988). The remote Eastern Hokianga area is situated in the Far North (Northland) region of New Zealand.  The area has a low population and is sparsely populated presenting an ideal place to relax with an unhurried atmosphere, flourishing fauna and flora, rich in New Zealand history and culture. This is an economically depressed area that is situated in the centre of Northland&#8217;s three key tourism icons - The Bay of Islands, the Waipoua Forest, and the top of the North Island. The location of the Eastern Hokianga presents an opportunity to create a tourism destination that will attract travellers frequenting the key tourism icons. To date there has been no research on rural tourism development conducted in the Eastern Hokianga. Although comprehensive research was conducted previously in the Hokianga by the James Henare Maori Research Centre (1999) it was concentrated specifically to the &#8220;Maori culture&#8221;. This research aims to examine and identify the key challenges of rural tourism development for the Eastern Hokianga through an analysis of rural tourism development approaches, and identifying the social and economic impacts of tourism. Key findings show that the Eastern Hokianga is an undeveloped area and does not fit with the majority of the rural tourism definitions as described in the literature. The area is displaying positive impacts of rural tourism development. The negative impacts are minimal as the Eastern Hokianga is still in the initial development stage of rural tourism. There are many integrated approaches to rural tourism development currently. A strategic approach is occurring with a tourism policy and community involvement in decision making. There is an integration approach with one RTO actively involved in the communities&#8217; tourism association with the local businesses. Two key clustering approaches are being utilized &#8211; the Twin Coast Discovery Route and total product packaging. Regeneration is not occurring but was not an issue raised by the community, whereas a financing approach was an identified challenge by Eastern Hokianga businesses. The need to improve accessibility through infrastructure was the second key challenge to rural tourism development. The area was not restricted by the other challenges of government&#8217;s role, education / experience and marketing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rural tourism</field><field name="subject">Tourism development</field><field name="subject">Governmental role in tourism</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist approach</field><field name="subject">In-depth interview</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Return to work and the New Zealand small business employer</field><field name="creator">Bloomfield, Christine</field><field name="description">The focus of this inquiry is &#8220;New Zealand small business employers&#8217; perspectives of the important factors in return-to-work (RTW) of an employee following a musculoskeletal injury or an illness&#8221;.  Whilst worldwide there is an increasing amount of attention focused on the RTW process in large organisations, there continues to be little understanding of this phenomenon in small businesses.  I chose to use a social constructivist theoretical framework drawing on grounded theory methodology to construct some understanding of the employers&#8217; perspectives of the RTW process.  Eight small business employers from Auckland and Christchurch participated in this research.  Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews.  Constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and thematic analysis were used to construct two themes from the data. The findings showed that small business employers prefer informal organisational approaches, rely on close working relationships with their staff, are generally wary of bureaucracy and often must run their businesses with limited staff and financial resources.  Having an employee off work for a prolonged period of time creates a sizable gap in the staff resources that keep the business running.  The employer has responsibility to fill this gap while maintaining a productive business.  In the absence of formal injury management practices an ad hoc approach was taken to the RTW process.  A number of the employers felt undervalued by key stakeholders, such as doctors, treatment providers, Accident Compensation Corporation and in some cases RTW co-ordinators.  Health and safety was a risk all employers appeared to take seriously whereas injury management information and support seemed less of a focus. This research suggests there may be little focus on injury management in small businesses by employers and, that employers perceive greater government emphasis on injury prevention.  The extent and associated costs of work disability in small businesses is as yet unknown, but it is likely to be significant.  How to support and encourage the uptake of injury management in small businesses in the long term warrants further investigation.  Understanding that employers may well lack injury management expertise, experience and resources requires stakeholders to make specific effort with the employer, at the workplace, to facilitate the RTW process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Return-to-work</field><field name="subject">New Zealand small businesses</field><field name="subject">Employers</field><field name="subject">Grounded theory</field><field name="subject">Injury management</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two generator discrete groups of isometries and their representation : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Haydn</field><field name="description">Let M &#934; and M&#968;  be elements of PSL(2,C) representing orientation preserving isometries on the upper half-space model of hyperbolic 3-space &#934;  and &#968; respectively.

Despite admirable goals in the NZBS 2000 to the contrary, efforts at improved biodiversity conservation have been insufficient to halt loss of significant amounts of indigenous forest and wildlife habitat. Increasing numbers of native species are moving towards critically endangered and extinction. Whatever we are doing in New Zealand, it is not effective enough. The aim of this study is to firstly identify factors contributing to the failure, &#8220;to halt the decline of indigenous biodiversity&#8221; in New Zealand and to then consider opportunities to overcome these barriers. In considering opportunities, this study then reviews the emerging discipline of landscape ecology as an answer to, at least, some of those factors and the recurring calls from New Zealand ecologists for a more integrated and holistic approach to biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in the planning framework and particularly provisions for biodiversity conservation in England are explored as a model of practical application of landscape ecological principles to land-use planning. From this review, the study proposes a new &#8216;LEEP&#8217; model for strategic biodiversity conservation that produces a regional-scale spatial conservation map and accompanying policy and implementation guide. Together they provide an integrated and holistic approach to restoring or creating functional landscapes that also recognises and provides for human activities and development. Application of the LEEP model is demonstrated through a case study of the Wellington region. Benefits and potential uses of the map and policy outputs are canvassed. Interviews with leading New Zealand and international ecologists provide an assessment of the current status of landscape ecology and interviewees also act as an expert &#8216;test panel&#8217; against which the Wellington maps and guides produced from the &#8216;LEEP&#8217; model are assessed. Finally, suggestions are provided for development of the new model and future research needs towards fuller and more effective implementation of this approach to biodiversity conservation in the New Zealand context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Case study of a Brazilian community association : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Public Policy at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rocha, Alberto Frederico Moraes da</field><field name="description">This is a Case Study Research done inside a poor community in Brazil. The main goal of the research is to facilitate this community to understand their problems and to overcome it. Therefore the researcher and the researched developed the following question &#8216;why NovaMosanta is not achieving its goals? The researcher wanted to work as a facilitator throughout the whole process of dialogue that aims to empower the community. Departing from that question and based on Freire&#8217;s ideas of education the research aims to build new knowledge from the interaction of academic and community knowledge. To implement this case study field research the researcher decided to use Participant observation and questionnaires. Surprisingly during the research the NGO called NovaMosanta faced the challenge of remodeling a public school without government help; otherwise the school would be closed. This NGO succeeded with the help of the New Zealand Government that gave NZ$15,000 to build two new classrooms in the school. Community members helped working in the remodeling and local commerce gave discounts to enable the remodeling. As a result the school will not be closed and the students will continue to study there. It also helped to increase community support and participation. Although not designed as a Participant Action Research, this thesis evolved to produce action and to change the community reality. It was an empowering process to the researcher and the researched. The community support increased and it also served s a catalytic event in the process of transformation and inclusion. Finally it clarifies the importance of producing fast results to maintain community support. You can check the research results in the links below that contain two local network reports about it.

Experiments were performed using a crossed-beams electron impact spectrometer, which included an unpolarised electron gun, and also a spin-polarised electron gun. The apparatus was tested, and shown to be operating well, by repeating past studies of electron scattering from helium and argon. Emission cross sections for the 4s4p 3P1, 4s4p 1P1, 4s5s 3S1, 4s4d; 5d; 6d 3D1;2;3 and 4s4d; 5d 1D2 states were measured from the respective thresholds to 50 eV. These were compared with Convergent Close-Coupling (CCC) and B-spline R-matrix (BSRM) calculations of the 4s4p 3P1, 4s4p 1P1, 4s5s 3S1, 4s4d 1D2 and 4s4d 3D1;2;3 emission cross sections. There are serious discrepancies between the theories, and between the theories and experiment, which indicates strong continuum coupling and innershell excitation effects in the electron excitation of zinc. The differential elastic scattering signal at scattering angles of 30 , 54 , 90  and 110  was measured for incident electron energies from just below the lowest excitation threshold at 4.003 eV, to the ionisation threshold at 9.394 eV. Some assignments given by Sullivan et al [1] and Zatsarinny and Bartschat [2] were confirmed by the present experiment. An area of disagreement in the literature concerning the nature of a feature observed at the 4s4p 1P1 threshold at 5.796 eV was resolved in favour of Zatsarinny and Bartschat, who assign the feature as a cusp. ...   Below the ionisation threshold, the 4s4p 3P1 photon excitation function supports the assignment of the near-4s4p 1P1 threshold feature as a cusp. Some of the overlapping negative-ion resonances which were observed near 7.5 eV in the 4s4p 3P1, 4s4p 1P1 and 4s5s 3S1 photon excitation functions were assigned with the assistance of the BSRM calculations of Zatsarinny and Bartschat. However, continuum coupling effects above 8 eV seem to cause the theoretical negative-ion resonance predictions to break down. Above the ionisation threshold, the near-11 eV negative-ion resonance effects depend on the configuration n, L and S of the neutral state excitation observed. This may be due to the properties of the mixed negative ion component states. Postcollision interaction (PCI) effects the 4s5s 3S1, 4s4d; 5d; 6d 3D1;2;3 and 4s4d; 5d 1D2 photon excitation functions. The PCI mechanism can populate the 4s4d; 5d; 6d 3D1;2;3 and 4s4d; 5d 1D2 states because the scattered and ejected electrons have a similar energy, and can thus exchange a large amount of orbital angular momentum. The present work demonstrates that electron correlation effects, especially those associated with innershell excitation, are very significant in electron scattering from zinc. Existing theoretical models of electron scattering from zinc inadequately treat electron correlations, and as a result of this are inaccurate, as shown here. The studies presented here should guide the development of models that accurately describe the innershell excitation effects, which are important for zinc and a great many other atoms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collisions (Nuclear physics)</field><field name="subject">Electron configuration</field><field name="subject">Electrons -- Scattering</field><field name="subject">Scattering (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Atomic collisions and interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the viability of a national accreditation system for Australian piano teachers</field><field name="creator">Gwatkin, Jan</field><field name="description">The Federal education system has 12 nationally accredited and portable qualifications issued by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) which cover three sectors; Higher Education, Vocational Education and Training (VET) and Schools. A mandatory minimum bachelor qualification together with education units, state registration and ongoing professional development is imposed for all classroom music teachers. In direct contrast, however, Australian studio piano teachers and school instrumental teachers may or may not have formal qualifications, registration with professional associations, or ongoing professional development. All teachers must be registered with State registration boards for Working With Children (WWC) but no monitoring controls exist for studio teachers. Qualifications are available from public examination boards, private enterprises and state Music Teacher Associations (MTAs) but these are not recognised within the national system and consequently have no status or portability, although they are used and recommended within the industry and higher education institutions as course prerequisites. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a National Accreditation System (NAS) for Australian studio piano teachers could be a viable system, adding unprecedented professionalism to the field and drawing upon the existing systems of government, private industry and educational institutions. In the thesis, current systems of accreditation, education and training available for classroom music teachers, school instrumental music teachers and other recognised professions such as lawyers, engineers, accountants, health professionals and sports coaches were reviewed as a comparative basis upon which to assess similar contexts for studio piano teachers. Results are combined with a survey of Australian piano teachers' perceptions, from which the study ascertained the extent to which studio piano teachers' needs were being catered for and met in available systems of accreditation and training.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accreditation -- Standards -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Instruction and study -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Piano -- Methods</field><field name="subject">Piano teachers -- Certification -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Vocational qualifications -- Certification -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Accreditation</field><field name="subject">Piano teaching</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SONIFICATION AND INFORMATION

Such interventions are employed with the expectation that they will be effective in reducing levels of stress in participants and in turn, will provide a return to the organisation by way of increased productivity through performance improvements of those employees whose stress has been reduced. Despite the increasing popularity of SMIs, there exists a lack of evidence on whether they have any effect on the performance of users, and on the relative effectiveness of the components that often make up SMIs. Although the literature addressing SMIs and their effects is increasing, relatively few studies directly compare different techniques, and even fewer employ randomised controlled designs or follow-up measures. The assumed relationship between the reduction of stress and improvement of managerial performance does not appear to have been tested with a randomised controlled trial. The term &#8220;stress&#8221; as used in this study specifically denotes the concept of &#8220;distress&#8221; as defined by Selye (1956; 1987).  To support this use of the term, the evolution of current terminology in the field of occupational stress is briefly discussed with specific reference to the development and influence in the wider literature of the Yerkes Dodson Law (Yerkes, 1909). The aims of this thesis were to (1) compare the relative effectiveness of two component techniques often used in SMIs (somatic and cognitive techniques) in the reduction of stress, and (2) to examine the effect of the use of these techniques on the performance of managers in their workplace. Study One was a randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of the use of somatic and cognitive stress management interventions on stress and performance in managers. Participants were 112 corporate managers who were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (somatic or cognitive technique training) or to a wait list control group. The intervention groups were trained in their respective techniques over a 4 week period in brief (20-30 minute) face-to-face workshop sessions. Participants were provided with recordings of the techniques to assist practice between training sessions. At baseline, stress was assessed using the Occupational Stress Inventory &#8211; Revised Edition (OSI-R, Osipow, 1998), and managerial performance was assessed with the Personal Qualities Competency from the Inventory of Management Competencies (IMC, Saville Holdsworth Ltd., 1993). In the case of the IMC, self, colleague, and subordinate assessments were used. On completion of the 4 week intervention, the OSI-R was readministered, and then at week 12 and week 24, follow-up assessments of stress and managerial performance took place. At the week 12 follow-up, MANOVA for the OSI-R showed no significant difference between the somatic and cognitive interventions in their effect on stress, although both interventions did reduce stress relative to the wait list control group, as measured by the OSI-R. A significant intervention effect was also shown (&#951;p2  =  0.089, p =  0.002) for the combined intervention groups (cognitive and somatic). MANOVA for the Personal Qualities Competency showed a significant intervention effect for the self (&#951;p2  =  0.077, p  =  0.008) and colleague (&#951;p2  =  0.064, p  = 0.013) assessments, and a no significant effect (&#951;p2  =  0.032, p  =  0.063) for the subordinate assessment at the week 12 follow-up point. Unfortunately, withdrawal and attrition reduced the sample size below that required for analysis at the week 24 follow-up point. Study Two was designed as a follow-up qualitative study that aimed to gather information on participants&#8217; perceptions of the effects of the interventions on their stress and performance, and of their reasons for completion or no completion of the SMI. In this study, 14 participants from Study One took part in semi-structured interviews after the final follow-up assessment (week 24) for that study. The interviews were structured to elicit responses concerning participants&#8217; perceptions of the demands of their workplace and their stress, their experience of using the stress management techniques (including perceived benefits or behavioural changes from that use), their reasons for completion or no completion of the intervention, and their own definitions of stress. Several important findings emerged from this study. First, participants described their workplace as characterised by high pressure and demand with rapid change and a perceived lack of personal control. Second, participants who continued to use the techniques they had learned after the formal intervention was completed did so because they perceived personal benefits in terms of their ability to relax and in terms of their perceptions of workload and demand. For those who did not complete the intervention, the predominant reasons reported for no completion were workplace task demands, lack of top management commitment to an intervention of this nature, and lack of personal gain once the techniques had been learned. In relation to defining stress, participants did not have agreement, but rather reported definitions reflecting a multifaceted complex amalgam of physiological, psychological, and emotional aspects. Research such as this is important in terms of its contribution to the general field of occupational stress and its alleviation. It addresses a long-standing need to assess the relative effectiveness of some of the subcomponents commonly employed as part of more complex multifaceted approaches to SMIs, and the effect of the techniques on both stress and performance. This thesis makes several contributions to existing knowledge. First, this thesis clarifies the origin of the Yerkes Dodson Law and its relevance to current stress management thinking. In management texts distress has come to be regarded as too much stress or pressure. This is coupled with the idea that some stress has a positive impact on performance due to an earlier and erroneous interpretation of the Yerkes Dodson Law. Second, Study One provides evidence of the relative effectiveness of two different SMI components in the reduction of individuals&#8217; occupational stress, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of individual focussed SMIs in the reduction of stress in corporate managers. Third, Study One provides evidence for a positive effect on managers&#8217; performance consequent to their use of stress management techniques. This thesis also sheds light on managers&#8217; definitions of stress, and their reasons for completion or no completion of SMIs. In summary, individual focussed (or secondary) SMIs have the potential to reduce stress and to improve performance in corporate managers as perceived by both the individual and others in the workplace.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Occupational stress</field><field name="subject">Management performance</field><field name="subject">Stress management</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand's state-owned enterprises: underlying elements and financial implications</field><field name="creator">Luke, Belinda</field><field name="description">The concept of strategic entrepreneurship has received increased attention over the past ten years.  Viewed as the intersection of entrepreneurship and strategy, this field of research is populated by conceptual studies which focus mainly on the nature and perceived benefits of strategic entrepreneurship.  Similarly, the study of entrepreneurship in a public sector context has gained increasing support in recent years, but also remains underexplored.  To address these gaps, this thesis considers: What are the underlying elements and financial implications of strategic entrepreneurship in New Zealand&#8217;s state-owned enterprises [SOEs]? New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector, comprising 17 government-owned, commercially focused organisations, is considered to be a prime subject for this research.  Well known for their implementation of new public management [NPM], many New Zealand SOEs have also been publicly recognised as both innovative and entrepreneurial.  The research question is addressed by first developing a preliminary framework of strategic entrepreneurship from literature on entrepreneurship and strategy.  This framework is then examined in the context of case studies on activity which is entrepreneurial and/or strategic within 12 of the 17 SOEs operating in New Zealand as at 2006.  Transcripts from a series of interviews, and publicly available documents are analysed thematically.  SOEs&#8217; financial statements over a five year period are also analysed. The thesis contributes in two broad areas.  First, much-needed empirical support is lent to the concept of strategic entrepreneurship.  Key elements of strategic entrepreneurship identified include opportunity identification, innovation, acceptance of risk, flexibility, vision, growth, and leveraging from core skills and resources such that existing knowledge and skills are transferred and applied to create new products, services, and markets.  Important supporting elements identified include an open, flexible, and progressive culture, operational excellence, and cost minimisation.  The nature of each of these elements is also investigated.  A detailed understanding of the relationship between strategic entrepreneurship and wealth creation reveals various internal and external factors which may influence the nature and strength of the relationship.  These factors include changes within the organisation, as well as changes in the economic and political environment, and are important influences on the resulting returns realised.  Second, this thesis offers valuable evidence in support of emerging change in the public sector towards the adoption of strategic entrepreneurship.  Support for the value of NPM is provided, with clear evidence of financial returns from New Zealand&#8217;s SOE sector.  Further, a key finding is the structured and systematic approach to entrepreneurial activity within the context of NPM in several New Zealand SOEs.  Such behaviour is referred to in this thesis as new public entrepreneurship. This form of activity offers the potential for competitive advantage and financial gain traditionally associated with entrepreneurial activity, but also limits the respective risks through its structured, systematic approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">State-owned enterprises</field><field name="subject">Business entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Government linked companies GLC</field><field name="subject">Case study approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretivist paradigm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence speaks volumes</field><field name="creator">Jeurissen, Maree  Jayne</field><field name="description">The continuing failure of our education system to meet the needs of minority group students, who continue to walk through classroom doors in increasing numbers, provided the initial impetus for this research project. Researchers, academics, and school practitioners need to examine carefully 'taken for granted' patterns of talk and behaviour that occur in schools every day, because for many children, these are not effective. This study is situated in a mainstream primary school classroom where children from diverse language and cultural backgrounds work and learn together. The importance of the interaction that occurs between teachers and children is discussed and numerous studies which focus on the role of discourse in students' language learning are critiqued. The fact that students in mainstream primary schools must learn language while using language for content learning, is considered to be of paramount importance, and so discourse that occurred during small group mathematics lessons provided the major source of data for the project. An aspect of this discourse, language functions of student initiated interactions, was examined in depth. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to look beyond the surface level of classroom discourse in an attempt to better understand why children interact as they do, or why they remain silent, appearing to be on the periphery of the learning opportunities which are designed to help them to succeed. Classroom observations and individual interviews provided insights into the complex and competing forces which shape the talk that occurs between students and their teachers. It was revealed that successful students have effective relationships with teachers, regardless of whether or not they share the same cultural background. These successful students are able to deploy a range of thinking and learning strategies. The importance of making the 'culture of the classroom' explicit is highlighted, along with the fact that teachers feel constrained by the demands of an overcrowded curriculum and the need to address individual learning needs of all of their students. Implications for classroom practice along with teacher training and professional development are proposed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign Languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' stories of self case study while learning cognitive therapy: a New Zealand narrative study</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Niccy</field><field name="description">This narrative inquiry study examines the stories told by seven adult students about learning cognitive therapy and how they experienced being both the subject and the writer of their own case study. At the time of being interviewed, some were completing a Bachelor of Counselling or Alcohol and Drug Studies, while others had completed their counsellor training and had employment in their profession. The students completing the Alcohol and Drug Studies are also trainee counsellors with a particular specialisation. All students completed a ten day, introductory course in Cognitive Therapy. There has been limited research exploring the learning experiences of students on cognitive therapy training. There does not appear to be any research on either the use of self case study in Cognitive Therapy education or the student experience of self case study. The purpose of this study was twofold: firstly, to explore the students&#8217; perspectives on what it was like to learn cognitive therapy and secondly, to explore the students&#8217; experiences of completing a case study on themselves. In this study, narrative interviews were used to invite participants to tell their story. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed. The participants&#8217; in depth stories when analysed, produced clear thematic content as well as unique accounts of personal learning journeys. Analysis involved rewriting each interview as a core narrative, structured to show each participant&#8217;s position when they began learning, the essence of the story line, their unique voice, the plot direction, the story&#8217;s climax, including the impact on their identity and finally, their core message. These narratives are represented by six short pieces of prose and a poem. The narrators and cognitive therapy are central characters in all stories. Thematic content was depicted as steps in a learning process. All core narratives were sent to each participant for checking that it captured their original story and its meaning. The findings were that adult counselling students found brief introductory training courses in Cognitive Therapy to be very effective for enabling them to learn the cognitive therapy model, to refine their cognitive therapy skills and to enhance their own personal development. Self case study has the potential to provide a complex, multi-dimensional learning opportunity facilitating deep learning. Self case study can result in transformative learning and the development of new stories of identity for the writer (and subject) of the case study. Individual student accounts suggest that Cognitive Therapy can be usefully adapted for some Maori and self case study can be a means of strengthening cultural identity. In addition, for some counselling student trainees, the process of doing a self case study may provide a means of working through childhood trauma. The findings provide some preliminary support for including use of self case study within the counselling curriculum. Self case study can provide opportunities for deepening learning about theory and practice, which is all the more potent when related to students&#8217; own selves. Given support, students might be encouraged to complete self case study as a means of gaining significant personal development. Such curriculum changes would require additional expertise on the part of counselling educators. The narratives analysed in this study suggest that particular support may be needed to enable the safe self development of students from ethnic minority groups and also to provide well for those who had experienced childhood trauma. This is recommended as an area for further research. Given that Counselling education has the task of developing and preparing students for the Counselling profession, students&#8217; perspectives on this experience, are an important and relatively underdeveloped area of research. There is a need for further research specifically on students&#8217; learning experiences in Cognitive Therapy. Ongoing research is needed about the use of self case study as a learning opportunity for student learning and personal development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Student learning experience</field><field name="subject">Narrative research</field><field name="subject">Self case studies</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Student perspective</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spaces between us</field><field name="creator">Eggert, Silke</field><field name="description">This screenplay is a fictional Coming of Age story of a young restless woman who, on an existentialist search for her inner self, investigates into the truth behind her famous grandmother's past, an anthropologist who conducted controversial research in the Samoa of the 1920s.

The types of strategies older people use to overcome barriers to participation and manage limitations are not widely known or reported. Exploring strategies for participation employed by older people is important because the majority of older New Zealanders live in the community and their numbers are growing, and projected to reach 25% of the total population by the year 2051 (Ministry of Health, 2002). New Zealand&#8217;s Positive Ageing Strategy (Minister for Senior Citizens, 2001), advocates for a society where people can age positively, where they are highly valued and their participation encouraged. The literature relating to occupation, participation and health was explored, and provided some evidence that older people are developing strategies and, with some education, are able to manage their own health conditions. The assumption underpinning this study is that they are equally able to manage strategies for participation, particularly those devised by older people themselves. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used. The participants were selected following a presentation to a group of older adults and snowball recruitment. They were aged between 73 and 98 years old and were receiving assistance to live in community, which was taken to indicate they had experienced some limitation in, or barrier to their everyday activities, in response to which they might have discovered or developed coping strategies. Interviews were conducted in the participants&#8217; homes, and analysed using a general inductive approach. Four main categories emerged; strategies for keeping me safe, strategies for recruiting and accepting help, strategies for meeting biological needs, and strategies for conserving resources. Overarching themes of managing and getting on with it, sprinkled with a sense of humour by some participants was present in the attitudes of many participants. The study revealed that this group of older people can and do use strategies to enable occupation in their everyday lives, which differ from those recommended by occupational therapists and other health professionals. This finding suggests that health professionals, policy makers and educators have much to learn from older people. The provision of help to older adults should take into consideration the importance of social interactions, not just the physical needs. There is a need for transport to be more readily available and affordable for older people to attend occupations that meet social needs. Health professionals complement the strategies developed by older people, and finding ways to combine the strategies should be developed.  Listening to older adults&#8217; current ways of managing and working with them to develop alternate, yet acceptable methods will provide a challenge. Health professionals should take a greater role in advocating for the social and transport needs of older adults.  A self-management approach in education for older people, using peers and making use of existing education groups in the community and health system, is suggested. Education of those who engage with older people, such as carers, family, health professionals and community groups should include developing their skills in assisting older people to identify their strategies and developing strategies for the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Strategies</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Occupation</field><field name="subject">Qualitative descriptive</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SKEIN: pick up styx</field><field name="creator">Turner, Raewyn Mary</field><field name="description">The work in progress, Pick Up Styx, investigates re-sensing and extra-sensing of the world.

The Open Organisations Profile was developed as an assessment tool of the Open Organisations theoretical model. The Open Organisations Model offers researchers a lens to assess an organisational system and the system&#8217;s ability to adapt to internal and external changes in its environment, while maintaining a sense of unity.While the Open Organisations Profile has been used extensively in Australia and the United States of America, limited research has examined its psychometric properties. This current set of studies aimed to examine the psychometric qualities of the instrument. The first study examined the reliabilities and factor structure of the Open Organisations Profile. Results indicated that the Open Organisations Profile displayed high internal consistency ranging from r = .80 to r = .95. Furthermore confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the theoretical three factor model of unity, internal responsiveness and external responsiveness.The second study assessed cultural differences and similarities between Australia and American using the profile. The findings suggested that significant differences existed between the countries and also between male and female values across the nine dimensions measured.The final study examined the relationships between the three higher order factors of openness and customer satisfaction and sales performance. The study found that the three factors of openness had a mediating effect on customer satisfaction and sales performance. The three studies showed the Open Organisation Profile offers researchers a reasonably reliable and valid instrument for assessing the openness of an organisation and its ability to adapt to internal and external changes in the organisation&#8217;s environment. Furthermore, the Open Organisations Profile could be used as guide to the areas that need to be addressed to help the organisation improve service delivery, customer satisfaction and financial return.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organization</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bose-Einstein condensates in coupled co-planar double-ring traps : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masterate of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Haigh, Tania J</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical study of Bose-Einstein condensates in a doublering trap. In particular, we determine the ground states of the condensate in the double-ring trap that arise from the interplay of quantum tunnelling and the trap&#8217;s rotation. The trap geometry is a concentric ring system, where the inner ring is of smaller radius than the outer ring and both lie in the same two-dimensional plane. Due to the difference in radii between the inner and outer rings, the angular momentum that minimises the kinetic energy of a condensate when confined in the individual rings is different at most frequencies. This preference is in direct competition with the tunnel coupling of the rings which favours the same angular momentum states being occupied in both rings. Our calculations show that at low tunnel coupling ground state solutions exist where the expectation value of angular momentum per atom in each ring differs by approximately an integer multiple. The energy of these solutions is minimised by maintaining a uniform phase difference around most of the ring, and introducing a Josephson vortex between the inner and outer rings. A Josephson vortex is identified by a 2p step in the relative phase between the two rings, and accounts for one quantum of circulation. We discuss similarities and differences between Josephson vortices in cold-atom systems and in superconducting Josephson junctions. Josephson vortices are actuated by a sudden change in the trapping potential. After this change Josephson vortices rotate around the double-ring system at a different frequency to the rotation of the double-ring potential. Numerical studies of the dependence of the velocity on the ground state tunnel coupling and interaction strength are presented. An analytical theory of the Josephson vortex dynamics is also presented which is consistent with our numerical results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Josephson vortex</field><field name="subject">tunnel coupling</field><field name="subject">superconductivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240200 Theoretical and Condensed Matter Physics::240203 Condensed matter physics-electronic and magnetic properties, superconductivity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balancing hope and reality: Caregiving dilemmas for neonatal nurses in caring for extremely premature babies</field><field name="creator">Green, Janet Anne</field><field name="description">As the capacity for saving smaller and smaller infants increases, the ethical dilemmas experienced by neonatal nurses who care for the smallest and most fragile of human beings will also increase. The current approaches to the resuscitation and management of extremely premature infants (24 weeks gestation and less) has resulted in the survival of infants with far less than optimal outcome. Neonatal nurses have begun to question saving the lives of extremely premature infants just because the technology exists to do so.

This study explores the ethical issues faced by neonatal nurses caring for infants of 24 weeks gestation and less. The research question arose out of the need for neonatal nurses to articulate the ethical issues that they face in clinical practice when caring for extremely premature infants. The study design takes a dual approach to the research question, namely, a survey questionnaire and a qualitative analysis informed by phenomenology. Given the complexities of the issues within the topic, this combination of methods was deemed to be the most appropriate in gaining a convincing and authentic result. The results of this research are not generalisable to the experience of other nurses, or nurses caring for other groups of premature infants.

In the first stage of the study neonatal nurses, members of the Australian Association of Neonatal Nurses (ANNA), were surveyed using a self-completion questionnaire. Then, in the qualitative component of this study fourteen (14) interviews with neonatal nurses were undertaken. These were either single or focus group interviews. In all, twenty four neonatal nurses from the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were interviewed about their experiences of caring for infants of 24 weeks gestation and less. The questions asked during the interviews were based on findings from the questionnaire. 

The interview data was analysed using a qualitative approach informed by interpretative phenomenology. The qualitative analysis revealed that the ethical dilemmas faced by the nurses existed within four themes. The four themes are: 
&#149;	It&#146;s all about this baby 
&#149;	Having a voice
&#149;	Dealing with awfulness 
&#149;	Reflecting on the outcome. 

The qualitative description as given in the four themes reveals structures and meanings about what it is to be the neonatal nurse who experiences ethical dilemmas when caring for extremely premature infants. 

The study and its findings are a written account of the experiences of neonatal nurses and their ethical dilemmas in caring for infants of 24 weeks gestation and less. The meanings within the nurses&#146; experiences are offered and the final phenomenological description, Balancing hope with reality, is given. Hope has a buffering effect on the nurses. The nurses inspire and instil hope in themselves and a baby&#146;s parents until the reality of a poor outcome dawns. Each time an extremely premature baby is born the nurses are hopeful for a good outcome, but the reality is that they have experienced many instances in which babies die or have a poor outcome. The neonatal nurses, affected by their experiences of ethical distress, attempted to find a pathway to achieve a balance between their emotions and caring for the baby. In doing so the nurses were able to remain productive the neonatal intensive care unit, and give high quality care to the baby and compassion to the parents.

This study makes an important contribution to neonatal nursing knowledge and practice by exploring the ethical dilemmas and complexities associated with extremely premature infants. This study also makes a unique contribution to the body of literature on ethical dilemmas experienced by neonatal nurses.</field><field name="date">19/4/2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">extremely premature babies</field><field name="subject">prematurity</field><field name="subject">microprems</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">neonatal nurses</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080818.191527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social and environmental reporting practices of organisations operating in, or sourcing products from, a developing country: evidence from Bangladesh.</field><field name="creator">Islam, Muhammad Azizul</field><field name="description">This research consists of a broad study in three parts of the social and environmental reporting practices of organisations operating in or sourcing products from a developing country, in this case Bangladesh. The first part of this study explores the social and environmental disclosure practices of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the body responsible for organising the activities of 4,200 entities involved in the export of garments from Bangladesh. By way of interview, this part documents the opinions of numerous senior executives from the BGMEA with regard to any changes in the degree of social and environmental pressures since 1985. Utilising a complementary theoretical perspective that includes legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory and institutional theory this part then performs an analysis of the BGMEA's annual reports (1987-2005), to explore the link between the perceived pressures and changes entailed therein and th e social and environmental disclosure practices of the BGMEA across the period of analysis. The results show that the disclosure practices of BGMEA appear to be directly driven by the changing expectations of multinational buying companies- the group deemed to be the most powerful stakeholder group. This section is the first known study to interview managers from a large organisation in a developing country about shifting stakeholder expectations and then to link these changing expectations to annual report disclosures across an extended period of analysis. The findings then directly lead to the second major part of this thesis which investigates the social and environmental disclosure practices of two major multinational buying companies: Nike and H&amp;M. Adopting a joint consideration of legitimacy theory and media agenda setting theory, this second part investigates the linkage between negative media attention and positive corporate social and environmental disclosures over a 19 year period. The results supp ort the view that for those industry-related social and environmental issues that attract the greatest amount of negative media attention, these companies react by providing positive social and environmental disclosures. The results were particularly significant in relation to labour practices in developing countries-the issue that attracts the greatest amount of negative media attention for the companies in question. While the second part demonstrates that the media influences particular disclosure practices, the third part of the thesis shows what drives the media. Based on the speculation provided in the second part, the third part tests the proposition that the media is an important ally of NGOs in their quest to influence change in corporate accountabilities. Through the use of interviews, the results of this part of the study provide evidence to support previously untested perspectives about NGOs' utilisation of the media. The results reveal that NGOs use the media because the media is responsible for  creating real changes in the operations and disclosure policies of organisations sourcing products from Bangladesh. The various pressures impacting the activities of organisations operating in or sourcing products from developing countries constitutes a fascinating area of investigation, and it is hoped that this study will motivate further research in this area.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social</field><field name="subject">environmental reporting</field><field name="subject">developing country</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090821.145037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building green capability in small-to-medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs).</field><field name="creator">Phan, Mai Thi Huong</field><field name="description">Despite the widely acknowledged contention that pollution control measures would be less beneficial than pollution prevention technologies in the long run, pollution control approaches remain a popular solution for organizations seeking, or coerced, to engage in corporate environmentalism.  Drawing on the conceptual underpinnings of the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an integrative framework, this study combines the tenets of five major management theories - institutional, stakeholder, planned behaviour, resource-based view, and life-cycle management - to examine how and why small and medium sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) embrace dissimilar approaches to implementing green initiatives under different circumstances.   This research adopted a nested, multiple-case design to explore why some organizations have been able to obtain beneficial effects from their green initiative implementation while others have not.  The findings, based on the experiences of s even SMMEs, which implemented a total of 27 green initiatives in their production operations, reveal that legislative requirements, stakeholders' expectations, organizations' natural environmental orientation, as well as their environmental resource base and capabilities, jointly drive corporate environmental strategies.  The case study found that the higher the external pressures, a combination of legislative requirements and stakeholder expectations, the more likely it was for SMMEs to adopt quick-fix, off-the-shelve solutions, which typically carried limited short-term benefits with associated high long-term costs.  By contrast, less intense external pressures offer firms the opportunities to explore plausible options and exploit internal resource capabilities to advantage, giving rise to the adoption of more sustainable approaches. The study further discovers that experiential learning, i.e., a firm's ability to learn from its green initiative implementation experience, separates SMMEs capable of capital izing on the values of their implemented green initiatives to gain competitive advantages and redefine competition from those that are immersed in a cognitive lock-in, unable to free themselves from an unproductive green wall.  The findings suggest that nurturing organizational learning among environmentally resistive firms could transform them into environmentally responsible enterprises.  The study concludes by interpreting its findings into a number of theoretical propositions for theory building in corporate environmental management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Green initiative implementation</field><field name="subject">green initiative building capability</field><field name="subject">Small-and-Medium-sized Manufacturing Enterprises (SMMEs)</field><field name="subject">Green Wall</field><field name="subject">experiential learning</field><field name="subject">knowledge nexus</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090821.162056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 (Cephalopoda: Oegopsida)</field><field name="creator">Bolstad, Kathrin S.</field><field name="description">Squids in the family Onychoteuthidae Gray, 1847 have been reported from every ocean but the Arctic, are taken frequently in deep-sea fisheries by catch, and are ecologically important in the diets of many marine predators including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sharks, and seabirds. However, the diversity and systematic of the family have remained poorly understood. Of the 60+ nominal species, 12&#8211;14 have generally been accepted in recent studies. Challenges to clarity include insufficient species descriptions, original descriptions published in eight languages and often based solely on early life stages, non-designation or subsequent loss of type material, and the existence of several unresolved species complexes. In light of the general systematic disarray of the Onychoteuthidae, a global revision of the family follows, based on ~1500 specimens examined from 19 repositories. Type material has been examined wherever possible; for some species, photographs of type specimens, original illustrations, and/or the original descriptions have provided the only information available. It has not been possible to fully disambiguate taxa in some cases (e.g. Gen. nov. 2), given the limited material and information available, but for all species treated in this revision (25 out of 26 species; no material was available for Kondakovia nigmatullini), descriptions and illustrations are provided to a consistent standard that will enable their reidentification. External and internal morphological characters and states are described for sub adult to adult stages of most species, with external characters reported through ontogeny as permitted by available material. Historically important characters are treated (general external morphology, body proportions, tentacle clubs, photophores, gladius, lower beak, radula), augmented by several more recently recognised characters (palatine teeth, detailed morphology of the tentacular hooks in adults, tentacular suckers in paralarvae, chromatophore patterns). The systematic value of both historical and new morphological characters at the generic and species levels are discussed; at all ontogenetic stages, tentacular club and hook morphology are considered the most valuable characters, although body proportions and gladius also prove useful. Partial disambiguation of the Onychoteuthis banksii complex has been possible in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, resulting in the resurrection of Onychoteuthis bergii Lichtenstein, 1818 and Onychoteuthis aequimanus Gabb, 1868, the description of two new species, Onychoteuthis lacrima and Onychoteuthis prolata (in press), and the expansion of one species&#8217; recognised distribution (Onychoteuthis compacta) to include the Atlantic Ocean. The genus Moroteuthis Verrill, 1881 is considered a junior synonym of Onykia Lesueur, 1821, in accordance with the findings of several earlier authors. However, morphological differences in the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; ingens necessitate the resurrection of the subgenus Moroteuthopsis Pfeffer, 1908b, with all other Onykia species placed into a new subgenus, Onykia (Onykia). Sexual dimorphism is reported in the beaks of Onykia (Moroteuthopsis) ingens (new comb.), and revised sex-specific equations are given for estimating this species&#8217; biomass based on LRL. Morphological and historical genetic data suggest a more distant relationship between Onykia and the species &#8216;Moroteuthis&#8217; knipovitchi Filippova, 1972 than was suggested by earlier classifications. This species is therefore considered to represent an undescribed genus, herein referred to as Gen. Nov. 1, which cannot be more fully diagnosed and described at present due to limited material. The generic position of &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli (Okutani, 1981) is also uncertain; it may be allied to Walvisteuthis virilis Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986 (family Walvisteuthidae Nesis &amp; Nikitina, 1986), but confirmation is impossible without examining type material of W. virilis. A second new genus, Gen. Nov. 2, is therefore described for &#8216;Onykia&#8217; rancureli and several morphological variants reported from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Given that the majority of available onychoteuthid material was collected after 1950, resulting in the descriptions of over half of the generally accepted genera and species since 1960, ongoing collection programmes are necessary to further resolve onychoteuthid systematic.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Cephalopoda</field><field name="subject">Onychoteuthidae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the work of global virtual teams: the role of technology-use mediation</field><field name="creator">Clear, Tony</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role of technology-use mediation in supporting the work of global virtual teams.   The work is set in the context of a longer term action research programme into collaborative computing and global virtual teams, initiated by Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand and Uppsala University in Sweden.  Over the period since 1998, global virtual collaborations involving teams of students from both universities have been conducted annually.  This thesis investigates the 2004 collaboration cycle, in which participants from St Louis University Missouri joined the collaboration.  This was the first triadic collaboration, and covered Northern, Southern and Western aspects of the globe while traversing three widely divergent time-zones.  In spite of the extensive experience in collaboration possessed by the coordinators at all three sites, the results of the global virtual trial were at best mixed.  This repeated experience of dissatisfaction in our global virtual collaborations, in spite of the technology being in place has been a primary motivator for this work.  Why is global virtual collaboration difficult?  What roles and activities are critical?  How can we do it better? These are not issues solely to do with the student actors in the global virtual teams, but more to do with the supporting cast, engaged in &#8220;activities which involve the shaping of other users activities of [technology] use&#8221; (Orlikowski et al., 1995, p.425).  Thus came about my interest in exploring the topic of technology-use mediation. This thesis applies a research framework adapted from DeSanctis &amp; Poole&#8217;s &#8220;Adaptive Structuration Theory&#8221; (1994) by the author.  Initially applied to &#8220;facilitation&#8221; in virtual teams &#8220;Extended Adaptive Structuration Theory (EAST)&#8221; (Clear, 1999a), has undergone further development.  The resulting research framework &#8220;Technology-use Mediated AST (TUMAST)&#8221; is applied here for the first time to investigate technology-use mediation activities performed during the global virtual collaborative trial.  A corpus of data based on the email communications of supporting parties to the collaboration is analysed in depth in this study, applying a combination of grounded theoretic and structurational techniques.  Thus a very rich and firmly grounded picture of the processes of technology-use mediation is built.  This thesis represents the first known in-depth longitudinal study of technology-use mediation in a real global virtual team setting.  From this exploratory study some novel theorizations have resulted.  Methodologically it demonstrates analysis of technology-use mediation applying the TUMAST framework in a manner that captures the richness and evolution over time of these complex activities.  Substantively it proposes a novel theory of &#8220;Collaborative Technology Fit (CTF)&#8221;.  It is hoped that future global virtual team coordinators and researchers may apply the theory in order to map their situation, and diagnose their degree of collaborative alignment on multiple dimensions, thus enabling corrective actions to be taken.  While the work arises in a tertiary education context, it reflects the reality of professionals at work in a global virtual team.  Its application within other domains remains to be proven, but readings from the literature, and personal experience within global virtual software development teams suggest its wider applicability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology-use mediation</field><field name="subject">Global virtual teams</field><field name="subject">International collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology</field><field name="subject">Collaborative technology fit</field><field name="subject">Technology-use mediated adaptive structuration theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Te Toi o Matariki: a cultural model for personal growth and development</field><field name="creator">Iwikau, Betty-Lou</field><field name="description">There is a greater recognition by Maori of the potentially harmful effects of alcohol and drugs. However there are concerns about the patterns of use and the rising incidence of alcohol and drug related risks such as; hospital admissions, domestic abuse, and alcohol and drug related convictions. As a result alcohol and drug use among Maori is a major threat to their health and well being. Consequently there is a need for models that are culturally appropriate to effectively address the problem. In New Zealand there is an increase in the use of customary Maori values, beliefs and practices in the treatment of Maori with substance abuse. This has also involved the integration of Western approaches and treatment modalities that are beneficial to Maori. However, the main purpose of the research is to give credence to Te Toi o Te Matariki model within the clinical setting. It is anticipated that the outcomes will inspire confidence in cultural model of practice in personal growth and development for Maori people who present with substance abuse. Te Toi o Te Matariki model is examined in the context of the Te Ara Hou residential drug and alcohol programme, a service provided by Raukura Hauora o Tainui (RHOT) in Auckland. The analogy is "to ascend or achieve to the highest point of the Whare Wananga (house of learning) so that the best view or position in the world is gained." It demonstrates three stages of continuous layers and has been developed in accordance with the key principles of the whakapapa (genealogy) paradigm of Te Kore, Te Po and Te Ao Marama.

The emergence of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the context of transnational capitalism precipitates the co modification of information, communication and knowledge. This process is obscured by the ideological construction of techno-futurism. Techno-futurism is a combination of technological determinism and futurism that appropriates notions of progress. In the pages which follow, historical analyses of this ideology inform the subsequent critique of knowledge economy discourse. In New Zealand knowledge economy discourse contained techno-futurist elements and deflected attention from the global absorption of national capitalism. In this context the Catching the Knowledge Wave Conference (KWC), held in Auckland in the first days of August 2001, is examined. I argue that the instigators and organisers of the conference were enmeshed within the business culture of finance capital and ICTs.

It focuses on the lived experience of therapists and the different meanings made of what is experienced. The purpose of this research is to bring into the light spiritual experiences of therapists and how they are experienced in the therapeutic process. It contributes to current debate about spiritual experience in the day- to- day practice of psychotherapy. The methodology of phenomenological hermeneutics is chosen as it provides the means to study therapists' lived experience. The study is guided by the philosophical thinking of Heidegger, Gadamer and Van Manen.The findings of this study reveal different types of spiritual experience. These include non-ordinary states of consciousness where there is a feeling sense of being beyond the boundaries of linear time and space. Experiences involve noticing subtle body feelings before they manifest in everyday consciousness. They include hearing and seeing phenomena that may normally be overlooked or disavowed in psychotherapy. The findings show therapists' ability to notice, explore and utilize subtle body phenomena was a combination of their own capabilities, their spiritual practice, and years of experience as therapists. The therapist's body appeared to be like a doorway into experiences that had transformative effects on both therapists and clients. The meanings made of experiences reflected therapists' spiritual and cultural beliefs. These beliefs meant that therapists are attuned to something bigger than everyday identity that gave meaning and purpose to the work and was a rich source of wisdom and guidance, comfort and a sense of being held in the work.  Specific attitudes and qualities of presence are revealed that reflect therapists' spiritual beliefs. Participants described experiences that emerged out of the context of the therapeutic relationship but could not be explained clinically. The findings show therapists' world views, their spiritual and cultural beliefs and capacity to experience the unknown, bring a richness and diversity of meanings to the therapeutic relationship that includes the wider contexts of culture and the environment.  This study explores current thinking about spiritual experience in psychotherapy and its effects on the therapist. It raises issues for further discussion relating to the role of therapists' spiritual experience in contemporary psychotherapy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychotherapists</field><field name="subject">Interpretative methodology</field><field name="subject">Unstructured interviews</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Dreams and synchronicities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theatre of painting: a structural exploration of the forming of an image through paint</field><field name="creator">Roche, Linda</field><field name="description">This studio-based project explores a method of working that assigns agency to paint and process within the medium of painting. Underpinning this exploration is the notion that process driven making could potentially pose as a per formative event. Choreographed yet contingent, the practice investigates the relationship between the potentiality inherent within media and the extent to which this is affected by temporal/ external factors in the determining of outcome. A dialogue between the intentional and the contingent is initiated through a systematic approach that involves manipulation of the constituent elements of paint and the implementation of procedure and protocols as a means to activate conditions of possibility. Central to the research concerns are issues surrounding the ability of media to articulate itself, determine its own temporality and of process and content to operate conterminously. The images produced evidence this investigation as both enquiry and consequence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">Process</field><field name="subject">Systems</field><field name="subject">Materiality</field><field name="subject">Performativity</field><field name="subject">Intentionality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of shoulder flow zone formation in thick section FSW of 6061 Al alloy using scroll shoulder tool</field><field name="creator">Yan, David</field><field name="description">Friction stir welding (FSW) is a relatively new solid-state welding technology invented at The Welding Institute of UK in 1991. It is versatile and has been widely adopted to join various materials. There has been strong research activity on revealing the details of the material flow pattern in the nugget zone induced by the conventional shoulder tool. However, there is insufficient understanding on the aspects of the scroll shoulder tool design and the shoulder flow zone formation utilizing this type of tool. The major objective of this study was to conduct experiments, analyse results and then reveal the shoulder flow zone forming mechanism for the scroll shoulder tool. The method used was to identify the flow pattern in the shoulder flow zone using a &#8216;marker insert&#8217; technique, and then to suggest the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone based on the obtained flow pattern; although the &#8216;marker insert&#8217; technique has never been used to study the shoulder flow zone flow pattern induced by the scroll shoulder tool. Experiments were conducted to examine the thick sections 6061 aluminium &#8216;marker insert&#8217; welds, which were welded using a scroll shoulder tool at a range of welding parameters. These were followed by quantifying the mass of the accumulated work piece material within the scroll groove (pick up material-PUM), evaluating the effect of welding parameters on the shoulder flow zone formation, and documenting the shoulder flow zone flow pattern. The major finding was that there is a simple banded structure which forms in a layer to layer manner in the bottom portion of the shoulder flow zone, but it disappears in the top portion of the shoulder flow zone. Accordingly, the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone for the scroll shoulder tool was suggested as follows. Firstly, the tool pin is plunged into the work piece; the work piece material is extruded by the pin and pushed up into the scroll groove forming the PUM. Secondly, after the tool shoulder is plunged into the work piece to a certain depth, the scroll groove is fully filled up with the PUM. Finally, during the forward movement of the tool, the central portion of PUM is driven downward by the root portion of the pin and then detaches from the pin (tip portion) in a layer to layer manner. It has also found that the thickness of the shoulder flow zone varies with a thicker on the advancing side than on the retreating side, and there is a positive linear relationship between the mass of PUM and the weld quality. This study has revealed for the first time the forming mechanism of the shoulder flow zone, and has improved the understanding of the shoulder flow zone formation using a scroll shoulder tool. It is recommended that a &#8216;shoulder-breaking&#8217; technique is developed to break the rotating shoulder suddenly and hence embed it into the work piece during FSW, in which a real-time shoulder-work piece couple could be produced for a better three-dimensional examination of the shoulder flow zone.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Friction stir welding</field><field name="subject">Material flow</field><field name="subject">Shoulder flow zone</field><field name="subject">Engineering technique</field><field name="subject">Metallography</field><field name="subject">Quantification of induced PUM</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talanoa: matala 'oe fonua</field><field name="creator">Toluta'u, Talita</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with representation.

Recent literature has mainly focused on identifying psychological coping strategies thought to assist in adapting to the caring role.  As a consequence, there is limited knowledge regarding the experiences of how spouses and partners attend to their own health and well-being.  This study aimed to explore how spouses and partners sustain their own health and wellness while supporting a stroke survivor.  Purposive and theoretical sampling strategies were used to guide recruitment.  Semi-structured interviews were carried out with seven spouses and partners who were living with, and supporting a stroke survivor.  A central theme with three sub-themes became apparent when examining spouses and partners&#8217; experiences.  The theme of Meeting Needs connects the three sub-themes, in that spouses&#8217; and partners&#8217; health and wellness appeared to be influenced by and intertwined with attending to the stroke survivors&#8217; needs.  The context of Being in a Relationship provided a rationale for prioritising the stroke survivors&#8217; needs and was the first sub-theme.  Secondly, Living Both Lives explains how spouses/partners were busy thinking and attending primarily to the stroke survivor&#8217;s daily requirements whilst also trying to attend their own needs.  The third sub-theme, Uncertain Health encompasses how a spouse&#8217;s and partner&#8217;s well-being is connected to the stroke survivors&#8217; health and their future concerns about being able to provide care if they themselves become sick.  Therefore, these circumstances shaped their ability to attend to their own health and well-being.  Whilst attending to the stroke survivor was at the forefront of their minds there were some strategies which spouses/partners utilised to support their own health and well-being.  These were: creating time and space for themselves; talking with others; and comparing own lives against others who were seen to be worse or better off, in order to support their own emotional well-being. This study found that the participants struggled to prioritise and attend to their own health and well-being, as most of them was busy primarily attending to the stroke survivor&#8217;s needs.  Overall, results suggest that exploring what spouses/partners think and do within the relationship could be valuable for health practitioners.  Given that it is the intimate nature of being in a relationship that is the foundation for spouses/partners supporting the stroke survivor, it could also be important for services and health professionals to consider the well-being and needs of the couple, not just the stroke survivor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Caring for sick</field><field name="subject">Informal caring</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Coping strategies</field><field name="subject">Support for caregivers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting youth for work in New Zealand: a case study of the Samoan experience</field><field name="creator">Tasi, Bruce Siumanaia</field><field name="description">Pasifika people are a youthful population group. It is important therefore that Pasifika youth have opportunities to live fulfilling and satisfying lives where they can achieve their dreams, support themselves and their families and make valuable contributions to their local communities, their country and global communities now and in the future. Government and local city councils have become more proactive in developing strategies that will assist young people to be part of an inclusive economy. One of the key areas identified, is the transitioning of low achieving and disengaged school leavers into further education, skills training or employment. Hence the government's and the councils' shared goals of implementing the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs in 2007, which is to ensure that all youth between 15-19 years of age are in employment, education, training or other activities that lead to their long-term economic independence and wellbeing (Ministry of Youth Development, 2004). Transition courses provide bridging alternatives for youth transitioning from school to employment. They are designed to provide extra help for students who leave school with low or no qualifications. In some cases youth find themselves out of favour with mainstream education and have been forced to end secondary schooling prematurely. Transition learning gives youth a second chance at education by improving their employment marketability.  This research highlights the rich stories of Samoan male youths' transitional journeys. The study discusses the critical factors that have contributed either positively or negatively in their ability to transition successfully into the workplace. Eight Samoan male participants were involved in the study ranging from 18-21 years of age. This research topic has evolved from the researcher's involvement in working with South Auckland Pasifika youth for over four years. Some of these youth have been traumatised by their school experiences and have had to face some enormous barriers when transitioning from school into the work place or further tertiary education. After selecting the topic, research frameworks that would be most appropriate for the research were explored. The researcher shares similar cultural and personal experiences to the participants. The framework for the study is therefore aligned to the values of the researcher. Accordingly, the multi-case study approach has been adopted; as such an approach has the potential to reveal what participants feel is significant. The interpretive paradigm underpins this research. The technique for gathering data was through semiformal in-depth interviewing. During the interviews, the participants had the opportunity to discuss the effects that the transitional courses had on them as learners and as Samoan youth. This method of research is culturally appropriate, as it allowed the depth of voices of these young Samoan people to be heard. The themes that have emerged from the findings reflect the broad categories of literature and research findings in the field of transition. The findings also provide new and insightful information about transitional experiences of Pasifika male youth. The research findings from this study focus on key aspects of programme implementation including; the teacher/student relationship, mentoring, student resiliency and the role of the government in youth transition. The research also evaluates the extent to which the transition course curriculum content supports student knowledge and skills in their current work situation. All participants in the study were generally positive about the courses they attended. They discussed the positives in terms of good tutoring, high degree of team cohesion and relevant meaningful learning experiences. The participants cited the negatives as poor teaching, and the low level of some of the literacy and numeracy activities they were expected to complete. Overall they were far more positive about their transitional learning than they were with learning at secondary school. Most felt prepared for work. The study proposes further research in the area of youth transition. Findings from this study will be disseminated to the appropriate government policy makers, city councils, youth services and tertiary providers through presentations at youth development conferences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative approach</field><field name="subject">Pasifika youth identity</field><field name="subject">Environmental influences to education</field><field name="subject">School to work transition</field><field name="subject">Cultural recognition</field><field name="subject">Tutoring and mentoring</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bluetooth information exchange network</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xiaoning</field><field name="description">Bluetooth is a low cost and low power wireless technology for connecting portable and / or fixed Bluetooth enabled devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc personal area networks (PANs). As the Bluetooth specification does not specify a protocol to form ad hoc Bluetooth networks, a method for forming an efficient Bluetooth network under a practical networking scenario is still an open research problem. This thesis introduces an approach to implement an indoor ad hoc Bluetooth wireless network, Bluetooth information exchange network (BIEN). This network formation is based on Bluetooth and Java technologies. A set of Bluetooth enabled devices configured with the BIEN software application are able to spontaneously establish a dynamic multi-hop wireless network using Bluetooth technology without the need of formal network infrastructure, centralized administration, fixed routers or access points. In this study, the performance evaluation focuses on the relation between network capacity and topology by testing end-to-end performance in terms of throughput and the latency of communication links with various parameters, including the hop number between nodes and the number of slaves in piconets. The evaluation results show that the throughput reduces with the increased length of a path, and with an increase in the number of slaves in a piconet in the network.  The latency also increases with path length, and with the number of slaves in a piconet in the different experimental BIENs, whether if there is traffic or not in the networks. Experimental results have further confirmed the necessity to minimize the number of bridge nodes in the Bluetooth networks due to their traffic bottleneck effect. This work is an attempt at implementation of a distributed multi-hop scatter net with an integrated routing protocol in the practical environments, while most of the literature focuses on covering the modelling of it. It intends to demonstrate how Bluetooth technology with Java technology can be used to design, develop and deploy ad hoc wireless networks with the commercial Bluetooth devices, and examine how well Bluetooth technology supports ad hoc multi-hop wireless network technology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="subject">Ad Hoc</field><field name="subject">Bluetooth</field><field name="subject">Wireless</field><field name="subject">Network</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spinning the web :the influence of the internet on the reporting of crime and criminal justice in traditional media</field><field name="creator">Cameron-Dow, Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the influence of the Internet on the reporting of crime and criminal justice in traditional media, focusing on the hitherto unexplored nexus of media, crime and the Internet. The Internet as a medium acknowledges no boundaries or geographical barriers and the implications of such globally unrestricted access are far wider than the mainstream consideration of several legal and ethical ramifications that accompany reportage on an international scale. This research represents a triangulated study, based on results obtained from an analysis of Internet crime sites, a process of elite interviewing of practising journalists and academics and demonstration case studies of three high-profile crimes.This research suggests the Internet audience wants shorter, more concise crime stories at first point of access, focusing on the main or more sensational aspects, with further background and detail available through links to the requisite multi-media facilities. These multi-media facilities often offer far more graphic detail and specificity than is available in mainstream media, particularly when the latter, constrained by such restrictions as deadlines and space, are compelled to dispense with superfluous detail, with no reader access to further information. In addition, the media theories of agenda-setting and framing undergo a noticeable transition when applied to online reporting.Crime reports on the Internet now complement the text of their narrative with audio and visual detail, bringing the audience ever closer to the scene of the crime and, in many instances, to the perpetrator and victim, again raising ethical issues and reopening the argument of the public&#8223;s right to know versus the individual&#8223;s desire for privacy.In addition, the speed of transmitting information and the ability to update it almost instantaneously must give the Internet a competitive edge in the media focus on attracting an audience and meeting its needs. Yet, despite the widely held consensus that the Internet is free from control, this coverage encounters some degree of gate-keeping.Exploration of available literature has complemented the study, which demonstrates conclusively the influence of the Internet on such journalistic elements as news values, legal and ethical issues, framing and agenda-setting in crime reporting in traditional media.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mass media and crime</field><field name="subject">Mass media and criminal justice</field><field name="subject">Internet.</field><field name="subject">Journalism (0391)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An automated pollen recognition system : a thesis submitted to Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering</field><field name="creator">Allen, Gary</field><field name="description">A system was developed with the aim of demonstrating that the tedious tasks of classifying and counting pollen on slides could be performed automatically to a standard comparable with that of human experts.

There are strict legal requirements for the daily noise exposure an adult worker can received in the workplace but nothing to control the noise children can receive in school and early education. There is also little or no data on how sound affects a child, compared to an adult. The early years of life are critical for the development of speech, hearing and auditory processes, as well as being the most vulnerable time for middle ear infections. This work sets out to determine the typical noise levels in early childhood centres and the effects on a range of children and their teachers. Reverberation times in most centres were found to well exceed the 0.6 seconds prescribed by the Australasian standard for schools and learning spaces. Very high levels of noise were recorded in a number of centres with a significant number of children and staff members, exceeding the maximum daily sound exposure of 100% permitted for workers in industry. A range of special needs children were identified as being particularly at-risk to noise, with the most adverse outcomes reported for those experiencing sensory integration disorder. Yet, even though high levels of noise were recorded, the majority of respondents in a survey of teachers rated the lack of sufficient space for the number of children present as the main issue, and inclement weather as the greatest environmental condition contributing to noise (by confining children indoors, especially over long periods of time). Hearing tests on the children were not permitted under the strict human ethics criteria to which this study had to conform, but simple hearing tests on a small group of teachers, revealed that hearing loss could be a serious occupational health issue. The legal issues of noise control and management in early childhood education have been addressed in this thesis, current legal frameworks reviewed, and recommendations presented for future consideration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hearing</field><field name="subject">reverberation</field><field name="subject">sound exposure</field><field name="subject">occupational health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321201 Environmental and occupational health and safety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing CBL systems for complex domains using problem transformation and fuzzy logic : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mohanarajah, Selvarajah</field><field name="description">Some disciplines are inherently complex and challenging to learn. This research attempts to design an instructional strategy for CBL systems to simplify learning certain complex domains. Firstly, problem transformation, a constructionist instructional technique, is used to promote active learning by encouraging students to construct more complex artefacts based on less complex ones. Scaffolding is used at the initial learning stages to alleviate the difficulty associated with complex transformation processes. The proposed instructional strategy brings various techniques together to enhance the learning experience. A functional prototype is implemented with Object-Z as the exemplar subject. Both objective and subjective evaluations using the prototype indicate that the proposed CBL system has a statistically significant impact on learning a complex domain. CBL systems include Learner models to provide adaptable support tailored to individual learners. Bayesian theory is used in general to manage uncertainty in Learner models. In this research, a fuzzy logic based locally intelligent Learner model is utilized. The fuzzy model is simple to design and implement, and easy to understand and explain, as well as efficient. Bayesian theory is used to complement the fuzzy model. Evaluation shows that the accuracy of the proposed Learner model is statistically significant. Further, opening Learner model reduces uncertainty, and the fuzzy rules are simple and resemble human reasoning processes. Therefore, it is argued that opening a fuzzy Learner model is both easy and effective. Scaffolding requires formative assessments. In this research, a confidence based multiple test marking scheme is proposed as traditional schemes are not suitable for measuring partial knowledge. Subjective evaluation confirms that the proposed schema is effective. Finally, a step-by-step methodology to transform simple UML class diagrams to Object-Z schemas is designed in order to implement problem transformation. This methodology could be extended to implement a semi-automated translation system for UML to Object Models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer-based learning</field><field name="subject">active learning</field><field name="subject">scaffolding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280301 Programming techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and numerics of generalised Euler equations : a thesis submitted to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D in Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xingyou</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the well-posedness, dynamical properties and numerical treatment of the generalised Euler equations on the Bott-Virasoro group with respect to the general Hk metric , k   2. The term &#8220;generalised Euler equations&#8221; is used to describe geodesic equations on Lie groups, which unifies many differential equations and has found many applications in such as hydrodynamics, medical imaging in the computational anatomy, and many other fields. The generalised Euler equations on the Bott-Virasoro group for k = 0, 1 are well-known and intensively studied&#8212; the Korteweg-de Vries equation for k = 0 and the Camassa-Holm equation for k = 1. Unlike these, the equations for k   2, which we call the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation, is not known to be integrable. This distinction motivates the study of the mCH equation. In this thesis, we derive the mCH equation and establish the short time existence of solutions, the well-posedness of the mCH equation, long time existence, the existence of the weak solutions, both on the circle S and R, and three conservation laws, show some quite interesting properties, for example, they do not lead to the blowup in finite time, unlike the Camassa-Holm equation. We then consider two numerical methods for the modified Camassa-Holm equation: the particle method and the box scheme. We prove the convergence result of the particle method. The numerical simulations indicate another interesting phenomenon: although mCH does not admit blowup in finite time, it admits solutions that blow up (which means their maximum value becomes infinity) at infinite time, which we call weak blowup. We study this novel phenomenon using the method of matched asymptotic expansion. A whole family of self-consistent blowup profiles is obtained. We propose a mechanism by which the actual profile is selected that is consistent with the simulations, but the mechanism is only partly supported by the analysis. We study the four particle systems for the mCH equation finding numerical evidence both for the non-integrability of the mCH equations and for the existence of the fourth integral. We also study the higher dimensional case and obtain the short time existence and well-posedness for the generalised Euler equation in the two dimension case.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">differential equations</field><field name="subject">asymptotics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230107 Differential, difference and integral equations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel technologies for the manipulation of meshes on the CPU and GPU : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rountree, Richard John</field><field name="description">This thesis relates to research and development in the field of 3D mesh data for computer graphics. A review of existing storage and manipulation techniques for mesh data is given followed by a framework for mesh editing. The proposed framework combines complex mesh editing techniques, automatic level of detail generation and mesh compression for storage. These methods work coherently due to the underlying data structure. The problem of storing and manipulating data for 3D models is a highly researched field. Models are usually represented by sparse mesh data which consists of vertex position information, the connectivity information to generate faces from those vertices, surface normal data and texture coordinate information. This sparse data is sent to the graphics hardware for rendering but must be manipulated on the CPU. The proposed framework is based upon geometry images and is designed to store and manipulate the mesh data entirely on the graphics hardware. By utilizing the highly parallel nature of current graphics hardware and new hardware features, new levels of interactivity with large meshes can be gained. Automatic level of detail rendering can be used to allow models upwards of 2 million polygons to be manipulated in real time while viewing a lower level of detail. Through the use of pixels shaders the high detail is preserved in the surface normals while geometric detail is reduced. A compression scheme is then introduced which utilizes the regular structure of the geometry image to compress the floating point data. A number of existing compression schemes are compared as well as custom bit packing. This is a TIF funded project which is partnered with Unlimited Realities, a Palmerston North software development company. The project was to design a system to create, manipulate and store 3D meshes in a compressed and easy to manipulate manner. The goal is to create the underlying technologies to allow for a 3D modelling system to become integrated into the Umajin engine, not to create a user interface/stand alone modelling program. The Umajin engine is a 3D engine created by Unlimited Realities which has a strong focus on multimedia. More information on the Umajin engine can be found at www.umajin.com. In this project we propose a method which gives the user the ability to model with the high level of detail found in packages aimed at creating offline renders but create models which are designed for real time rendering.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer graphics</field><field name="subject">3D mesh data</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">3D modelling</field><field name="subject">Umajin</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280305 Multimedia programming</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into a range of idiosyncratic crystalline glazes and aesthetically compatible forms</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Peter G.</field><field name="description">This study documents the evolution of a unique body of ceramic work which straddles the areas of science and art.

The study articulates the stages of contemplation, design and development in the creation of a unique body of work which is cognisant of the decorative qualities of crystalline glazes. The forms are simple and uncomplicated, and the work is concerned with the pinnacle of the craft of ceramics at every level.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glazing</field><field name="subject">ceramics</field><field name="subject">crystalline glazes</field><field name="subject">visual communication</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">self (philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/26007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chromosomal Evolution of Delena cancerides</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Hayley Evette</field><field name="description">Chromosomal evolution has long been linked with the process of organismal speciation, and many different theories have been suggested over the years to explain why this would be so. These theories can be loosely grouped into two eras. Classical chromosomal speciation models focused on negative heterosis of chromosomal rearrangements causing malsegregation and germ cell death in hybrids. More recent models examine the effects of reduced recombination around rearrangements and the impact this can have on sequence evolution, specifically the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities.&#182; The huntsman spider Delena cancerides is known to be highly
chromosomally variable, and to have reduced recombination near fusions. However, this species has previously only been interpreted with reference to the classical models of chromosomal speciation, the expectations of which it does not fit well. Broad-scale sampling of this spider has revealed extensive chromosomal diversity and complexity. Twenty one chromosomally differentiated populations (karyomorphs) of this spider have now been described, including those with the putatively ancestral configuration of all telocentric bivalents at meiosis (tII), and many that are saturated for Robertsonian fusions. These include up to six different karyomorphs with metacentric bivalents (mII), eight karyomorphs that form a chain of chromosomes at male meiosis, and six
karyomorphs that form two separate but co-segregating chains.&#182; A computer simulation was used to test hypotheses regarding the evolution of this chromosomal diversity, which indicated that fusions are likely to have accumulated gradually, possibly due to meiotic drive. Historical phylogeographic analyses have shown that deep cryptic divisions exist which are concordant with the chromosomal diversity.&#182; Hybridization experiments have suggested that many hybrid zones between karyomorphs of this species are tension zones, and that genetic incompatibilities are likely to play an
important role in generating partial reproductive isolation of karyomorphs. Furthermore, several hybrid zones appear to have been modified by staggered clines. The staggering
of clines is thought to ameliorate reproductive isolation mechanisms that are dependent on epistatic fitness interactions, and so may prevent diverging populations progressing
towards speciation. &#182;Therefore, on the basis of the available evidence, D. cancerides may fit the recombination suppression model of chromosomal speciation, although it may be unlikely that the karyomorphs will progress towards full species status. Hence, this species may in the future make a highly informative model organism for investigating the early stages of genetic reproductive isolation associated with chromosomal rearrangements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromosomes</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="subject">spider</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090823.124906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dryland salinity, mosquitoes, mammals and the ecology of Ross River virus</field><field name="creator">Carver, Scott Stevenson</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] In an era of emerging and resurging infectious diseases, understanding the ecological processes that influence pathogen activity and the influences of anthropogenic change to those are critical. Ross River virus (RRV, Togoviridae: Alphavirus) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis occurring in Australia with a significant human disease burden. In the southwest of Western Australia (WA) RRV is principally vectored by Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (Diptera: Culicidae), which is halophilic. The inland southwest, the Wheatbelt region, of WA is substantially affected by an anthropogenic salinisation of agricultural land called dryland salinity, which threatens to influence transmission of this arbovirus. This study assessed the ecological impacts of dryland salinity on mosquitoes, mammalian hosts and their interactions to influence the potential for RRV transmission. Many aquatic insect taxa colonise ephemeral water bodies directly as adults or by oviposition. Using a manipulative experiment and sampling from ephemeral water bodies in the Wheatbelt, I demonstrated that salinity of water bodies can modify colonisation behaviour and the distribution of some organisms across the landscape. Halosensitive fauna selected less saline mesocosms for oviposition and colonisation. In particular, Culex australicus Dobrotworksy and Drummond and Anopheles annulipes Giles (Diptera: Culicidae), potential competitors with Ae. camptorhynchus, avoided ovipostion in saline mesocosms and water bodies in the field. This finding suggests salinity influences behaviour and may reduce interspecific interactions between these taxa and Ae. camptorhynchus at higher salinities. Using extensive field surveys of ephemeral water bodies in the Wheatbelt I found mosquitoes frequently colonised ephemeral water bodies, responded positively to rainfall, and populated smaller water bodies more densely than larger water bodies. The habitat characteristics of ephemeral water bodies changed in association with salinity. Consequently there were both direct and indirect associations between salinity and colonising mosquitoes. Ultimately the structure of mosquito assemblages changed with increasing salinity, favouring an increased regional distribution and abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus. The direct implication of this result is secondary salinisation has enhanced the vectorial potential for RRV transmission in the WA Wheatbelt. ... This thesis contributes to an emerging body of research aimed at delineating important ecological processes which determine transmission of infections disease. Collectively the findings in this study suggest dryland salinity enhances the potential for RRV activity in the Wheatbelt. Currently, human RRV notifications in the Wheatbelt do not reflect the salinity-RRV transmission potential in that area, but appear to be associated with dispersal of RRV from the enzootic coastal zone of southwest WA. I speculate dryland salinity is a determinant of potential for RRV transmission, but not activity. Dryland salinity is predicted to undergo a two to four fold expansion by 2050, which will increase the regional potential for RRV activity. Preservation and restoration of freshwater ecosystems may ameliorate the potential for transmission of RRV and, possibly, human disease incidence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinity -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Togavirus infections -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Togavirus infections -- Transmission</field><field name="subject">Togavirus infections -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Arid regions climate -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Ross River virus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of prognostic scoring systems to predict outcomes of critically ill patients</field><field name="creator">Ho, Kwok Ming</field><field name="description">[Tuncated abstract] This research thesis consists of five sections. Section one provides the background information (chapter 1) and a description of characteristics of the cohort and the methods of analysis (chapter 2). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system is one of commonly used severity of illness scoring systems in many intensive care units (ICUs). Section two of this thesis includes an assessment of the performance of the APACHE II scoring system in an Australian context. First, the performance of the APACHE II scoring system in predicting hospital mortality of critically ill patients in an ICU of a tertiary university teaching hospital in Western Australia was assessed (Chapter 3). Second, a simple modification of the traditional APACHE II scoring system, the 'admission APACHE II scoring system', generated by replacing the worst first 24-hour data by the ICU admission physiological and laboratory data was assessed (Chapter 3). Indigenous and Aboriginal Australians constitute a significant proportion of the population in Western Australia (3.2%) and have marked social disadvantage when compared to other Australians. The difference in the pattern of critical illness between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians and also whether the performance of the APACHE II scoring system was comparable between these two groups of critically ill patients in Western Australia was assessed (Chapter 4). Both discrimination and calibration are important indicators of the performance of a prognostic scoring system. ... The use of the APACHE II scoring system in patients readmitted to ICU during the same hospitalisation was evaluated and also whether incorporating events prior to the ICU readmission to the APACHE II scoring system would improve its ability to predict hospital mortality of ICU readmission was assessed in chapter 10. Whilst there have been a number of studies investigating predictors of post-ICU in-hospital mortality none have investigated whether unresolved or latent inflammation and sepsis may be an important predictor. Section four examines the role of inflammatory markers measured at ICU discharge on predicting ICU re- 4 admission (Chapter 11) and in-hospital mortality during the same hospitalisation (Chapter 12) and whether some of these inflammatory markers were more important than organ failure score and the APACHE II scoring system in predicting these outcomes. Section five describes the development of a new prognostic scoring system that can estimate median survival time and long term survival probabilities for critically ill patients (Chapter 13). An assessment of the effects of other factors such as socioeconomic status and Aboriginality on the long term survival of critically ill patients in an Australian ICU was assessed (Chapter 14). Section six provides the conclusions. Chapter 15 includes a summary and discussion of the findings of this thesis and outlines possible future directions for further research in this important aspect of intensive care medicine.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">APACHE (Disease classification system) -- Western Australia -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Outcome assessment (Medical care) -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine -- Western Australia -- Decision making</field><field name="subject">Critical illness</field><field name="subject">Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">Risk adjustment</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding IS development and acquisition: a process approach</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Laurie Carina</field><field name="description">Computer-based information systems (IS) play an increasingly pervasive and important role in contemporary organisations. Despite decades of continuing research and the development of an extensive prescriptive literature, IS development projects continue to be problematic, with many failing or being seriously challenged. In addition, the IS development environment has changed significantly in recent years, with rapid advances or shifts in technology, increasing devolution of IS responsibility and expenditure to user groups, high levels of packaged software acquisition and customisation, greater outsourcing of IS development, and an increasing emphasis on enterprise-wide and inter-organisational IS. In many cases these changes are interrelated and involve more flexible, ad hoc or non-traditional development approaches. Combined with the fact that at the same time IS have become increasingly sophisticated and integrated, the potential for unpredictable or unintended consequences has also increased. Together, the continued problematic nature of many IS projects and the changing IS development environment, suggest that there is an ongoing need for a fuller understanding of IS development processes and practices. Given the limitations of factor-based, prescriptive studies, an understanding of how contemporary IS development is enacted needs to be grounded in and built upon the cumulative body of research that attempts to understand the complexity and dynamic nature of IS development. Accordingly, this study uses a conceptualisation of IS development as a process in which an IS emerges from a dynamic and interactive relationship between the technology, its social and organisational context, and the negotiated actions of various individuals and groups. The thesis presents the results of an extensive empirical investigation into contemporary ARE development practices based on data collected from New Zealand. The study uses a range of research methods and ultimately develops a sociotechnical process model of IS development as situated action. Following Walsham&#8217;s (1993) emphasis on the content, context and process of IS-related organisational change, the methods used in this study are three-fold. First, an extensive literature review is undertaken to provide a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary empirical knowledge about the content of IS development. Second, a survey is used to collect contextual data about IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand. Finally, these both support an in-depth longitudinal case study of the IS development process in an organisational setting. The literature review synthesises the results of recent empirical studies of the various influences that shape IS development, using a classificatory framework based around actors, project content, IS development processes, and context. The review shows that, while a number of traditional factors influencing IS development continue to be relevant, other factors have emerged as important as a result of changes to the IS development environment and to IS development practice. In particular, increasing recognition within the IS literature has been given to the relative importance of people and process and of the organisational and environmental context in which IS development takes place. The results of the literature review inform the design of a survey instrument intended to provide an updated assessment of IS development and acquisition practices in New Zealand organisations. A Web-based survey was administered to a sample of senior IS managers in 460 public and private sector organisations with 200 or more FTEs. Based on the 106 usable responses, the results of the survey confirm the ongoing relevance of a number of traditional factors identified in the IS literature as facilitating or inhibiting IS development. However, a number of factors were identified as emerging or increasing in relevance in light of changes in the IS development environment. While the survey provides a useful description of contemporary IS development and acquisition practice in New Zealand, it does not enable a detailed understanding of IS development in action. To address this, an IS project in a large New Zealand organisation was followed in action for over two years. The project involved the development of a sophisticated financial database model using a purchased commercial software package and external consultants. As such, it provides a useful exemplar of development in a contemporary IS environment. The case study illustrates how a seemingly small, well-defined project experienced delays and difficulties as might be expected in larger, more complex projects. It offers insights into the significance of external actors, the importance of full stakeholder participation, the influence of initial characterisations of the nature of the project, and the observance of project management processes. Consideration of the project outcome reveals its multi-dimensional, subjective and temporal nature. A process approach (Markus &amp; Robey, 1988) is employed to structure the analysis of the case study. A combination of temporal bracketing, narrative analysis and visual representation is used to analyse the sequence of social action and organisational processes involved in the project and to develop a process explanation of how and why the particular project outcome in this case study developed over time. Underpinning and informing this analysis is the construction and utilisation of a model of IS development as a situated, sociotechnical process. Drawing on theoretical concepts from structuration theory and the sociology of technology, the model considers the situated actions and practices of various individuals and groups involved in IS development, the ways in which these are enacted within different contextual elements, and the role of existing and new technological artefacts in this process. IS development is characterised as iterative and emergent, with change occurring dynamically from a trajectory of situated interactions (in which meanings and actions are negotiated) and intended and unintended consequences. As a whole, this PhD highlights the changing nature of the IS development environment and the way a complex ensemble of &#8216;factors&#8217; interact to influence IS project outcomes. Common themes emerge around the importance of people and process, and the context in which IS development takes place, while at the same time explicitly including a consideration of technology in the analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative data analysis</field><field name="subject">Process approach</field><field name="subject">Interpretive case study</field><field name="subject">Sociotechnical</field><field name="subject">Situated action</field><field name="subject">Project management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two becoming one: immigrant Indian women sustaining self and well-being through doing: a grounded theory study</field><field name="creator">Nayar, Shoba C</field><field name="description">Using a grounded theory methodology, this research sought to describe the occupational change process Indian women experience as they settle in a new environment, with a focus on how they sustain their sense of self and well-being. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with eight women of Indian origin who had immigrated to New Zealand within the past five years in an attempt to generate theory about the processes that these immigrants' experience. A constant comparative analysis revealed a central change process, Two Becoming One, which encompassed three interconnecting occupational processes. The first process women experience is Oh God, Where Did I Come?. In this process, where the environment is new and unfamiliar, the women feel compelled to do familiar activities that they know they can accomplish, thus increasing confidence and supporting well-being. The second process, Being In The Change, sees the women learning more about their new environment and engaging in new occupations, while continuing to hold on to doing familiar activities. A New Zealander with an Indian Soul finds the women doing more as they embrace a strengthening sense of self and well-being and strive to build their future in a new land. Central to these three processes is the core category Two Becoming One. This process is a commentary on the women's journeys of integrating the demands of two cultures, each with its own unique environment and ways of doing things, while supporting a healthy sense of self and well-being throughout the experience. The study findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay that occurs within a person-environment-occupation interface. Situating the findings within current literature reveals the limitation of previous understandings of the person-environment-occupation dynamic, in relation to people performing in an unfamiliar environment. With an increasing trend of immigration worldwide, this study brings to light the importance of understanding the bearing that environmental context has on occupation and the resulting impact for persons' sense of self and well-being. Further research in this area is required to gain deeper awareness of the ways in which people interact with their environment over time, and the resultant effect on occupation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women immigrants</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Women, East Indian</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Occupational therapy</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triage codes: a predictor of nursing care time in the emergency department</field><field name="creator">Gabolinscy, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores triage code as a predictor of direct nursing care time, thus its potential usefulness in a model for calculating and allocating nurse requirements in emergency departments. A framework for nursing work is proposed. This framework is based on the works of O'Brien-Pallas, Irvine, Peereboom, and Murray (1997) and Houser (2003). It suggests that the structures of environmental complexity, nursing characteristics, patient nursing complexity, and patient medical condition and severity, impact on the processes of direct and indirect nursing care to affect patient outcomes. A prospective, non-experimental study was undertaken to examine the relationship between direct nursing care time and triage code. Six potential confounding variables were selected for this study: length of stay, age, ethnicity, sex, complaint type, and discharge category. Data were collected for 261 visits over a three day period in one New Zealand emergency department. Patient visits averaged 200 minutes. The mean direct nursing care time per visit was 49 minutes. On average, patients with more urgent triage codes, longer length of stay, or who were not discharged, received more direct nursing care. The model developed predicted 49% of variation in direct nursing care time (p &lt; .05) related to triage code (16%), length of stay (31%) and disposition category (2%).Further exploration of the proposed framework has potential to develop a model allowing managers to identify nurse staffing required for optimal nursing care in emergency departments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency nursing</field><field name="subject">Critical Care</field><field name="subject">Methods</field><field name="subject">Nurses instruction</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thematic analysis of recent PHARMAC new medicines' subsidy decisions</field><field name="creator">Villers, Trevor</field><field name="description">PHARMAC, the Pharmaceutical Management Agency, manages the Pharmaceutical Schedule on behalf of the Government. The Agency is tasked with securing the best health outcomes that are reasonably achievable from pharmaceutical treatment and from within the amount of funding provided (&#167; 47 NZPHD Act, 2000). The Agency reports that it continues to improve New Zealanders&#8217; access to funded medicines. In determining which pharmaceuticals to fund, PHARMAC&#8217;s Operating Policies and Procedures (OPPs) state that nine criteria guide its decision- making. The OPPs further state that PHARMAC can apply whatever weight it sees fit to the application of these criteria. I undertook a thematic analysis of 20 cases referred by PHARMAC&#8217;s principal medical advisory body, the Pharmacology and Therapeutic Advisory Committee (PTAC), to PHARMAC during the period February 2004 to November 2006 to determine whether these criteria were acknowledged in the official minutes of the respective bodies. PTAC is similarly required to take account of the abiding decision criteria. I also sought to determine whether other factors were apparent in guiding the decisions. There was evidence that PHARMAC consistently applied the decision criteria. PTAC was less assiduous in recording its application. In addition, I found that PHARMAC takes account of factors outside the stated criteria. I noted that PHARMAC takes particular account of the degree to which a decision might be publicly, politically or medically contentious in its decision-making.  I also found evidence that consistency with prior decisions is another factor which PHARMAC takes into account, though does not apply routinely. This research indicates that PHARMAC does take account of its abiding decision criteria, applying health needs as well as fiscal criteria, though the weighting given each criterion is nowhere apparent in its official minutes. There remains an opportunity for evaluative research to determine whether fiscal considerations &#8216;outweigh&#8217; needs considerations in PHARMACs decision-making.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thematic analysis</field><field name="subject">PHARMAC</field><field name="subject">Subsidy</field><field name="subject">Medical funding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To touch or not to touch. Male primary school teachers' experiences of touch: a hermeneutic phenomenological study.</field><field name="creator">Power, Nicola</field><field name="description">This thesis offers an interpretation of how eight male primary school teachers experience touch between themselves and their pupils/students. Despite the positive benefits of touch and evidence suggesting that appropriate forms of touch should be encouraged, the many meanings, interpretations and reactions to touch potentially complicate the ways in which people react. The potential for touch to enhance human well-being is therefore often diminished. The taboo surrounding touch is particularly evident in the school environment where limited research has been undertaken. This study gives voice to male teachers as they share their experiences in an era when the risks associated with physical contact between teachers and pupils are increasing. Hermeneutic phenomenology was used to explore and gain deeper understanding of the meaning of touch in education through interpreting the day to day experiences of male primary school teachers in New Zealand. Narrative interviews were interpreted and described thematically. The themes: &#8216;being careful, cautious and visible&#8217;, &#8216;worrying about misinterpretation&#8217;, &#8216;feeling sad&#8217; and &#8216;battling with boundaries&#8217;, revealed a complex array of tensions that contributed to the findings. Male primary school teachers are constantly aware of the risk they take when interacting with students. They experience tensions and conflict when deciding where and how they will touch children and whether this will be misinterpreted by others. Consideration of the ways in which people respond to this complex and sensitive subject is necessary so that male teachers feel able to use positive and appropriate forms of touch without fear of suspicion and reprisal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Men</field><field name="subject">Touching</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of the upper Waimakariri River catchment by observed rain &amp; radar reflectivity</field><field name="creator">Lu, Xiao Feng</field><field name="description">ModClark and Clark&#8217;s Unit Hydrograph (Clark&#8217;s UH) within HEC-HMS software are distributed and lumped models, respectively. Clark&#8217;s UH simulates the transformation and attenuation of excess precipitation, and requires time of concentration (Tc) and Storage Coefficient (R) parameters. ModClark transformation accounts for variations in travel time to catchment outlet from all regions of a catchment, and it additionally requires gridded representation of a catchment and Gridded cell-based input files. Four cases (three from observed rain, and one from radar reflectivity) of three chosen events were specifically chosen and examined for the comparison of simulation results with the same estimated initial parameters apart from different rainfall inputs. The Upper Waimakariri River Catchment was divided into ten subcatchments, and the HEC-HMS basin model parameters were estimated by using the physical/hydrological characteristics. However, ModClark transformation was unavailable because of an output error from converting ASCII to gridded Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) format by the conversion tool &#8211; ai2dssgrid.exe. Therefore, Mean Aerial Precipitation (MAP) for each subcatchment was calculated by Thiessen polygon method combined with an overlay analysis for grid-cell-based rainfall estimation from radar with geographic information system (GIS) tools. The automated calibration/optimisation procedure included in HEC-HMS package was applied to the cases which showed a deviation between simulation and observed flows. The purpose is to &#8216;optimise&#8217; the initial estimates of parameters only in a mathematical-fit manner based on the observed flows from the only discharge gauge at Old Highway Bridge (OHB). The TC values calculated from the five equations vary in a relatively narrow range apart from the one from Bransby-Williams equation. Therefore, the values from all the other four equations were averaged and used as the initial TC input. The simulation results showed that there was a notable difference between observed and simulated hydrographs for some case studies even though TC, R, CN, and lag time were calibrated/optimised separately. Also, radar estimated rainfall and grid-based data storage system (DSS) need more investigations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Waimakariri River</field><field name="subject">HEC-HMS</field><field name="subject">ModClark</field><field name="subject">Clark&#8217;s UH</field><field name="subject">DSS</field><field name="subject">radar reflectivity</field><field name="subject">ai2dssgrid</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of fouling in dairy processing : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Hayden Albert Edward</field><field name="description">Fouling of heat treatment equipment in the dairy processing industry is an expensive and persistent problem. The objective of this work was to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of dairy fouling in heat exchangers and identify methods to control this build-up. This was part of a larger project investigating the interaction between spore-forming thermophilic bacilli (thermophiles) contamination and fouling deposits on internal surfaces of equipment. Two systems were developed to monitor the onset and build-up of fouling on the internal surfaces of two research heat exchangers. The first used a commercial sensor to measure the local heat flux and the temperature on the hot side of a plate type heat exchanger. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated and normalised with its value at the start of the run to reflect the contribution of fouling deposits to the thermal resistance, thus giving a real-time estimate of the rate of fouling. The second system used an energy balance over a tubular type heat exchanger and measured inlet and outlet temperatures to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient thus giving a global measurement of fouling over the tubular heat exchanger. In both systems the plot of normalised heat transfer coefficient over time often stayed constant over an induction period, which was followed by a falling period indicative of growth in the fouling layer thickness and/or mass. Each system was validated by comparing the final value of the normalised heat transfer coefficient with direct measurements of fouling made at the end of a run namely: fouling deposit height for the local measurement and fouling deposit mass for the global measurement. The normalised heat transfer coefficient reported by each system correlated well with the corresponding direct measurement of the fouling layer. An important factor identified in this study was the effect of air bubble nucleation on fouling deposits. It was shown that bubbles that formed on the heated surface greatly reduced the length of the induction period to a matter of seconds rather than hours, as found in previous studies of fouling in the absence of surface bubbles. The rate of fouling was also enhanced while the bubbles remained at the surface. The structure of bubble type fouling layers was linked to the behaviour of the bubbles at the heated surface. Visual observations of these bubbles showed evidence of growth, vibration and coalescence during their period of attachment to the heated surface. Deposits from bubble type fouling consisted of all solid components found in the original milk solution, except lactose, in approximately the same ratio. By contrast fouling deposits reported in the literature with systems operating under the traditional protein denaturation mechanism were reported to consist mainly of whey proteins. Bubble induced fouling can be limited in a number of ways, the most effective being to maintain a high operating pressure in the equipment to ensure nucleation does not occur. Experiments conducted in this study showed that a pressure of 130 kPa.g was sufficient to suppress all bubble nucleation at the heated surface at a temperature of 90&#176;C. Another method identified was the use of high linear fluid velocities to entrain any surface bubbles into the processing stream immediately upon nucleation. Linear velocities above 1.0 m/s were shown to achieve this goal in the miniature plate heat exchanger tested. However, this method is only partially successful because the local linear velocity varies with position in heat exchange equipment of complex geometries and can drop below the mainstream average velocity causing surface bubbles to form, especially in recirculation regions behind flow obstacles. A more reliable method, in situations where high operating pressures could not be used, involved conditioning the heated surface with a thin protein layer during the first few minutes of a run. Conditioning the surface resulted in bubble suppression even at high temperatures and low pressures, thus greatly extending the length of the induction period. Trials performed in this study showed that the addition of a proteolytic enzyme produced by psychrotrophic microbes greatly increased fouling. The enzyme destabilised the caseins which could attach directly to the heat exchange surface independently from the bubble fouling mechanism. Thus the quality of the milk is another important factor to consider. However, the addition of enzymes produced by thermophilic bacilli isolated from milk powder plants did not increase fouling. A theory describing the air bubble induced fouling mechanism is presented along with recommendations on how to reduce this fouling contamination in processing equipment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy processing equipment</field><field name="subject">heat exchanger</field><field name="subject">fouling deposits</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Environmental Responsibility</field><field name="creator">Dummett, Kel</field><field name="description">This thesis uses document analysis and semi-structured personal interviews to look at current strategies and policies of major companies to manage the life cycle environmental risks associated with their products and processes, which I refer to as corporate environmental responsibility (CER); The thesis also explores what some national governments are and could be doing to encourage greater environmental responsibility from companies.        As environmentalists and climate scientists have been warning for decades, and now world leaders are coming to realise, the world faces serious environmental challenges, none more urgent than climate change. A failure to act to mitigate the risks associated with this one challenge, as Stern (2006, pii) asserts &#239;&#191;&#189;could create risks of major disruptions to economic and social activity&#239;&#191;&#189;.       A major proportion of the world&#239;&#191;&#189;s environmental problems can be attributed directly to  production, use and disposal of products (Tukker &amp; Jansen, 2006), and as this thesis will argue, national government policies to encourage or force greater environmental responsibility from producers are required to reduce risks and mitigate impacts. In recent decades national governments have been reluctant to intervene in the market place, preferring to rely on voluntary mechanisms, but as will be discussed in greater detail, there is now an increasingly critical voice (Zarsky, Roht-Ariaza &amp; Brottem, 2002; Hirschland, 2003; Archer &amp; Piper, 2003; Vogel 2005; Hay et al, 2005) that questions the effectiveness of voluntary corporate responsibility as it is currently practiced, which subsequently raises the question: what role national governments, and international governance should take?       The primary data sources for this thesis are personal interviews with senior business leaders from 25 major companies, recorded public speeches, both web and non-web based corporate public relations material, and personal interviews with key academics in the field, environmentalists and corporate analysts, conducted mainly between 2002 and 2004. The analysis of this data has sought to investigate the attitudes of major companies to:    -	corporate environmental responsibility, though some interrelated aspects of social responsibility are also considered;    -	what drives them to take greater responsibility to reduce their environmental risks;    -	government policies, especially possible legislation to encourage and/or force CER.       In addition through case studies of:   -	one industry sector    -	two major companies, and     -	one industry sector pilot study;       as well as secondary research on several other companies, this thesis investigates what some companies are saying and doing about corporate environmental responsibility. This will lead to a short discussion of the degree to which these companies&#239;&#191;&#189; rhetoric of responsibility matches their actions &#239;&#191;&#189; that is how much they are &#239;&#191;&#189;walking the talk&#239;&#191;&#189;.      The thesis also looks at the current potential of national governments in encouraging and/or forcing greater CER, then contrasts the development and implementation of national policies for CER in Australia with those in Europe, focussing on CER as it relates to products in the electrical and electronics industry.       The thesis concludes with some observations and suggestions on policies of major companies and of national governments, as well as international governance, to encourage greater CER.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate environmental responsibility</field><field name="subject">corporate accountability</field><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">government environmental policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090501.144600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of analyst-user cognitive style differentials to predict aspects of user satisfaction with information systems</field><field name="creator">Mullany, Michael John</field><field name="description">This study was primarily an empirical investigation in the field of Information Systems (IS) and the related fields of occupational psychology and management. It focussed specifically on the concept of user satisfaction, the construct of cognitive style as applied to users and systems analysts, and their interrelationships. Prior studies were found rarely to investigate the changes in user satisfaction during system usage. Further, any reference to cognitive style in the IS literature proved to be sparse, open to question and discouraging in terms of its value. By developing and using a new instrument, the System Satisfaction Schedule, or SSS, the present study was able empirically to demonstrate clear patterns of changing user satisfaction during system usage. These were demonstrated, both as a general trend and in terms of its relationship to the cognitive styles of the key players (analyst and user) involved in system development and maintenance. Cognitive style was measured using Kirton's Adaption-innovation Inventory, or KAI. This study was thus able to suggest new rules for system development based on the assessments of the cognitive styles of both users and systems analysts. These rules focussed primarily on simple team choice: which analyst to put with which user. However, inferences for larger system development teams were drawn and suggestions for further research duly made. The present study thus also contributes to the successful practice of system development. To give effect to the above, this study set out to investigate empirically the way user satisfaction changes over 1&#189; to 2 years of system usage and, as mentioned above, the way user satisfaction is impacted by the cognitive styles of the user and the systems analyst. Most significantly, relationships were studied between user satisfaction and the difference in cognitive style between the analyst and user. It was found that user satisfaction generally rises linearly with usage, and that while the size of the analyst user cognitive differential does negatively impact user satisfaction over most of the time of system use, this effect is only particularly strong for two short periods; one within the first four months of usage and the other in the last three. From these results the new rules for system development mentioned above, followed. In terms of the decline of users' mean perceived severities of individual problems, the exponential decay and reciprocal models were found to fit the data the best. This study developed a new model for the motivation to use, develop or maintain a system (the Mechanical Model), based on its own results and Herzberg's two-factor theory of motivation. In this, Herzberg's hygiene factors have been replaced with the concept of dissatisfiers. These are measured as expressions of dissatisfaction as and when they occur. Their use removes the researcher's need, when designing user satisfaction instruments, to speculate on complete lists of factors which may satisfy users, and which may date as technology and other contextual factors change.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">User interfaces (Computer systems)</field><field name="subject">Information resources management</field><field name="subject">Information technology - Management</field><field name="subject">Information Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of yeast species as the biocomponent for priority environmental contaminants biosensor devices</field><field name="creator">Gurazada, Saroja</field><field name="description">Along with an increasing understanding of the harmful effects on the environment of a wide range of pollutants has come the need for more sensitive, faster and less expensive detection methods of identification and quantitation. Many environmental pollutants occur in low levels and often in complex matrices thus analysis can be difficult, time consuming and costly. Because of the availability and easy cultivation of the microorganisms with potentially high specificity, there is considerable interest in the use of living microorganisms as the analytical component (the biocomponent) of sensors for pollutants. While a number of biosensors using bacteria have been developed, yeast has been comparatively rarely used as the biocomponent. Yeast are attractive because they are easy to culture and they are eukaryotes which means their biochemistry is in many respects closer to that of higher organisms. This thesis describes the development of whole cell bioassays that use yeast cells as a sensing element and redox mediators to probe the intracellular redox reactions to monitor the catabolic activity of the yeast resulting from the external substrate, steady-state voltammetry is utilised as the electrochemical detection technique.  The isogenic differential enzyme analysis (IDEA) concept of Lincoln Ventures Limited, lead NERF funded research consortium uses bacteria that have been cultured using specific organic pollutants as the carbon source which are the biocomponent in sensors. The use of wild type yeast Arxula adeninivorans that has the ability to use a very wide variety of substrates as sources of carbon and nitrogen was used as an alternative to bacteria to validate the &#8220;IDEA&#8221; concept. Naphthalene and di-butyl phthalate were chosen as model target contaminant molecules. The performance, detection limits and the usefulness of yeast based biosensor applications for environmental analysis are discussed. This thesis also describes the development and optimisation of a simple, cost effective in vivo estrogens bioassay for the detection of estrogens using either genetically modified or a wild type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, catabolic repression by glucose was exploited to achieve specificity to estrogens in complex environmental samples that eliminates the requirement for conventional sample preparation. This is the first time that the use of wild type yeast to quantify estrogens has been reported. The attractive features of the bioassay are its use of a non-GMO organism, its speed, its high specificity and sensitivity with a detection limit of 10-15 M. The similarity of binding affinities for major estrogens to those of human estrogens receptors makes this in vivo estrogen bioassay very useful for analytical/screening procedures. The electrochemical detection method also makes it easy to interface with a variety of electronic devices.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast</field><field name="subject">Biosensors</field><field name="subject">Environmental contaminants</field><field name="subject">Estrogen bioassay</field><field name="subject">Electrochemical deduction</field><field name="subject">Redox mediators</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation study of intangible business relationship value measurement</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Annie Liqin</field><field name="description">Both marketing researchers and practitioners realise that having customer relationships that enhance a firm's competitive advantage is an important strategic issue and that there is a need for relationship value measurement. But the research on relationship value measurement is limited, especially from a seller's perspective, despite numerous calls for it. The reason for the limited research might be that the nature of customer relationships is complex, largely intangible, and long-term oriented. Baxter and Matear's (2004) study directly addresses the issue of the measurement of the intangible part of the value of a business-to-business relationship from a seller's perspective. Synthesising an intellectual capital model into the relationship marketing literature, Baxter and Matear (2004) propose an intangible relationship value (IRV) model for assessing the value of the intangible part of the resources that sellers gain through their relationships with their business buyers. The IRV model has been empirically tested and supported in New Zealand's manufacturing industry. The current study replicated Baxter and Matear's (2004) study in order to further assess the validity of the IRV model and its scales. Exploratory factor analysis was used first to identify the dimensionality of the IRV. Then the four aspects of construct validity - reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and nomological validities - were examined. The exploratory factor analysis of the focal relationship value items in the questionnaire found six first-order dimensions of the IRV. As expected, these six first-order value dimensions are the same as in the Baxter and Matear (2004) study: competence, attitude, intellectual agility, relationships, organisation, and renewal and development. Further exploratory factor analysis of the summated scales of these six first-order values found two higher-order value dimensions: the human intangible value dimension and the structural intangible value dimension. Thus the dimensionality of the IRV model is supported in the current study. The exploratory factor analysis retained 36 out of the initial 42 measures developed by Baxter and Matear (2004). These 36 retained measures include 20 of the 22 measures in Baxter and Matear's (2004) final purified scales. The validity of these 36 measures was then further investigated. The reliability examination found that the measurements of the six first-order IRV constructs are reliable in the current study. Evidence was also found for the convergent and discriminant validities in the measurements of the human and structural intangible value, the convergent validity in the measurement of the IRV, and the nomological validity of the IRV construct. Thus, the 36 measures retained in the final results of the current study are valid for the respondents in the current study. The findings suggest that Baxter and Matear's (2004) intellectual capital approach to measuring IRV is appropriate. It has potentially provided a way to assess intangible value in relationships. Based on the dimensions and the measures provided by the IRV model, sellers can systematically assess the potential IRV of their current and potential customer relationships, and make their strategic decisions on how to manage these customer relationships accordingly.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship value</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Value measurement</field><field name="subject">Intangible value</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban voodoo: an ambiguity document, seeking to record the disruption of language through imitation</field><field name="creator">Paraone, Israe</field><field name="description">Urban Voodoo mimics semiotic phenomena, which constitute language and functions as a system of signs that intra-act ambiguously within their own system.  This project explores the link between the ambiguous signs of the worm, what looks like a mimesis of icons/symbols, and the way in which simulations are caught up in semiotic implications.  Urban Voodoo, which followed on from my earlier Project Iroiro, developed language precursors from the study of the marks of the worm, creating different patterns and styles, and generating language-like effects. Using this system of signs, my project explores the idea that humans are part of a system operated by language, and examines the notion that language itself may be disrupted. To explore this, my project is about layers of competing imprints, about 'languages' tagged into spaces occupied by several graffiti artists within a local skate park.  Urban Voodoo acts as a new Graffiti system. In mimicry, organisms make themselves resemble others or their environment. Icons 'look like' what they represent; simulation proposes 'to be' what it suggests. These concepts of assimilation and representation will be explored to understand and interrogate the power balance of language systems, starting with a specific local situation, the skate park.

An intelligent SEMG signal classifier would be used for recognising and treatment of musculoskeletal pain and some neurological disorders by physiotherapists and occupational therapists. SEMG signals displays the electrical activity from a skeletal muscle which is detected by placing surface electrodes placed on the skin over the muscle. The key factors of this research were the investigation into digital signal processing using various analysis schemes and the use of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for signal classification of normal muscle activity. The analysis schemes explored for the feature extraction of the signals were the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT).Traditional analysis methods such as FFT could not be used alone, because muscle diagnosis requires time-based information. CWT, which was selected as the most suitable for this research, includes time-based information as well as scales, and can be converted into frequencies, making muscle diagnosis easier. CWT produces a scalogram plot along with its corresponding frequency-time based spectrum plot. Using both of these plots, overviewed extracted features of the dominant frequencies and the related scales can be selected for inputs to train and validate an ANN. The purpose of this research is to classify (SEMG) signals for normal muscle activity using different extracted features in an ANN. The extracted features of the SEMG signals used in this research using CWT were the mean and median frequencies of the average power spectrum and the RMS values at scales 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. SEMG signals were obtained for a 10 second period, sampled at 2048 Hz and digitally filtered using a Butterworth band pass filter (5 to 500 Hz, 4th order). They were collected from normal vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles of both legs from 45 male subjects at 25%, 50%, and 75% of their Maximum Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) force of the quadriceps. The ANN is a computer program which acts like brain neurons, recognises, learns data and produces a model of that data. The model of that data becomes the target output of an ANN. Using the first 35 male subjects' data sets of extracted features, the ANN was trained and then validated with the last 10 male subjects' data sets of the untrained extracted features. The results showed how accurate the untrained data were classified as normal muscle activity. This methodology of using CWT for extracting features for analysing and classifying by an ANN for SEMG signals has shown to be sound and successful for the basis implementation in developing an intelligent SEMG signal classifier.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing - Digital techniques - Data processing</field><field name="subject">Signal processing - Digital techniques - Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Electromyography - Data processing</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A visual interpretation of Chinese immigrants&#8217; identity dilemma in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Nuo</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the notion of identity dilemma and its visualisation in the context of New Zealand Chinese immigration. It focuses on interpreting and visualising New Zealand Chinese immigrants&#8217; thoughts and feelings and their struggle to adapt to the environment as well as their ambivalent negotiation to balance their in-between identity of being a New Zealander (Westerner) and Chinese. It is a practice-based project and is presented by means of photography, with illustration as the supporting medium. The predicament of identity is explored through interviewing members of the New Zealand Chinese community. A semi-constructed interview is designed and introduced to canvass 20 Chinese participants&#8217; opinions of their cultural beliefs and sense of belonging in a Western society. The data is collected and analysed to investigate the informants&#8217; thoughts and feelings in their daily routine in a multicultural community. I, as an art and design practitioner, visually interpret and transcend my opinion of identity dilemma of Chinese immigrants into my practical works. The participants&#8217; thoughts and feelings are transferred into my artwork through creating patterns of visual elements.

Maternal nutrient balance and the subsequent dietary pattern of the family set the path for the growth and development of the individual and therefore also for their offspring. There is strong evidence from studies in India that mothers who have a low vitamin B12 status, but high folate, will have children with higher adiposity and more cardiovascular risk factors than those with adequate B12. The B12 status is closely linked to the dietary pattern particularly the consumption of red meat which has a high B12 content. In New Zealand there are an increasing number of Indian migrants. Vegetarianism is also practiced by an increasing number including young women. In addition, there is a high rate (up to 60%) of unplanned pregnancies in New Zealand. In the 1997 New Zealand National Nutrition Survey (NNS97) report, vitamin B12 intake appeared adequate for the New Zealand population and breakfast cereals were reported as one major dietary source of B12. Cereals in New Zealand however, were not fortified with B12 and there was an error in the FOODfile&#8482; data entries for B12 in some cereals. The raw data of reported B12 intakes in the 24-hour diet recall (24HDR) of NNS97 was reanalysed at the individual level by subtracting the B12 derived from breakfast cereals and applying the 2005 revised estimated average requirement (EAR) value. The possible prevalence of B12 insufficiency was 2.4 times that originally reported by the NNS97, translating into a prevalence of up to 27% of the population sampled. This analysis was limited as it was not adjusted for day-to-day variance or to the New Zealand population. This apparently high prevalence of risk for inadequate B12 intake in the surveyed individuals required confirmation that the B12 intake from 24HDR and also a 7-day diet diary (7DDD) was a valid assessment of B12 status. The group of particular interest is women of childbearing age (18-50y) with a range of eating patterns. Thirty eight women aged 19-48y; 12 non-red-meat-eaters (5 Indians vs. 7 non-Indians) and 26 red-meat-eaters (1 Indian vs. 25 non-Indians) participated in this validation study. Anthropometry and hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance (BIA) were measured on the same day as a 24HDR was recorded. Fasting serum lipids, glucose, haematological parameters, and serum B12, holotranscobalamin II (holo-TC II, a specific B12 biomarker), and folate concentrations were measured. Foods eaten and time spent in physical activity during the following 7 days were extracted from 7DDD and 7-day physical activity diary (7DPAD). There was no significant correlation between dietary intake (24HDR or 7DDD) and biomarkers for B12 status. Indians reported lower mean daily B12 intakes in 7DDD than non-Indians (1.6 vs. 4.5 &#956;g/day, p&lt;0.001) and this was confirmed by Indians&#8217; significantly low serum B12 (203 vs. 383 pmol/L, p=0.04) and holo-TC II (35 vs. 72 pmol/L, p=0.02) concentrations compared to non-Indians. A similar pattern was found between non-red-meat-eaters and red-meat-eaters in daily B12 intake in 7DDD (2.3 vs. 4.8 &#956;g/day, p&lt;0.001) and in B12 biomarkers (serum B12, 263 vs. 397 pmol/L, p=0.01; holo-TC II, 43 vs. 77 pmol/L, p&lt;0.005). Non-red-meat-eaters reported significantly higher daily folate intake in 7DDD (359 vs. 260 &#956;g/day, p=0.01) than red-meat-eaters but no significant difference was found in serum folate concentration between these groups (29 vs. 24 pmol/L, p=0.10). Indians/non-red-meat-eaters also reported lower daily protein intake and higher percentage of total energy from carbohydrate in 7DDD compared to non-Indians/red-meat-eaters but total reported energy intake tended to be under-reported and physical activity over-reported when assessed against estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR). Body composition varied by dietary pattern. Indians/non-red-meat-eaters had higher body fat percentage (BF %) and weaker grip strength than non-Indians/red-meat-eaters. In addition, Indians had a significantly higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) than non-Indians. Overall, the whole group reported that they were inactive. The median time spent in moderate, high and maximal intensity activities was only 19 minutes a day, which did not meet the NZ guideline for adults of 30 minutes a day. In this small study nutrient analysis of diet by 24HDR or 7DDD, was not a reliable or accurate way to assess B12 insufficiency. Questions about dietary patterns such as &#8220;do you eat red meat&#8221;, and taking ethnicity into account could more easily identify the at risk population. Supplementation and/or fortification of B12 should be considered before pregnancy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vitamin B12</field><field name="subject">Childbearing age women</field><field name="subject">Dietary patterns</field><field name="subject">Body composition</field><field name="subject">Holo-TC II</field><field name="subject">BIA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is a girl&#8217;s experience of physical activity? A qualitative descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Caroline</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explores the experiences of female adolescents in relation to physical activity. The study investigates the experience of being adolescent and the meaning of a female adolescent&#8217;s experience of physical activity.  A qualitative description with a phenomenological hue was the methodology used. Their perceptions of their lived experiences in relation to physical activity were revealed through stories. The participants were six adolescent females.  The study data was gathered through open-ended questions and in-depth conversations, to seek meaning of the adolescent&#8217;s experience of physical activity.  The interviews were transcribed and stories extracted from the data. Results from the findings of the study indicate that physical activity needs to be enjoyable for the female adolescent for her to be motivated to participate.  What specifically constitutes enjoyment for the adolescent differs for each individual.  The data also suggested that other persons of influence or the female adolescent&#8217;s environment may also have an impact on their participation.  Peers, parents, their gender, body issues, competition, running, and certain restrictions were revealed as making a difference. For the female adolescent participating in physical activity, it would be advantageous to find an approach that allows a girl to experience physical activity in the way that works for her.  Some participants, already good at sports, are likely to be very competitive, want to train hard, and will build friendships among their like-minded peers. These female adolescents are not so problematic. They already love physical activity and participate in it. The challenge is to target those female adolescents who do not participate on a regular basis, and to design successful interventions which promote and encourage them into physical activity.  This change may prevent a further decline in the levels of physical activity for the adolescent who is at a stage when physical activity may be so advantageous.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Girls and sport</field><field name="subject">Sporting influences</field><field name="subject">Social interaction</field><field name="subject">Body image</field><field name="subject">Adolescent health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value and validity of software effort estimation models built from a multiple organization data set</field><field name="creator">Deng, Kefu</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to empirically assess the value and validity of a multi-organization data set in the building of prediction models for several &#8216;local&#8217; software organizations; that is, smaller organizations that might have a few project records but that are interested in improving their ability to accurately predict software project effort.  Evidence to date in the research literature is mixed, due not to problems with the underlying research ideas but with limitations in the analytical processes employed: &#8226;	the majority of previous studies have used only a single organization as the &#8216;local&#8217; sample, introducing the potential for bias &#8226;	the degree to which the conclusions of these studies might apply more generally is unable to be determined because of a lack of transparency in the data analysis processes used.  It is the aim of this research to provide a more robust and visible test of the utility of the largest multi-organization data set currently available &#8211; that from the ISBSG &#8211; in terms of enabling smaller-scale organizations to build relevant and accurate models for project-level effort prediction. Stepwise regression is employed to enable the construction of &#8216;local&#8217;, &#8216;global&#8217; and &#8216;refined global&#8217; models of effort that are then validated against actual project data from eight organizations.  The results indicate that local data, that is, data collected for a single organization, is almost always more effective as a basis for the construction of a predictive model than data sourced from a global repository.  That said, the accuracy of the models produced from the global data set, while worse than that achieved with local data, may be sufficiently accurate in the absence of reliable local data &#8211; an issue that could be investigated in future research.

Research conducted over the last 50 years indicates a modest role for psycho-social factors as risk factors for these conditions. The research suggests that in combination with other modest risk factors, psycho-social factors play an equally important role. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) gained notoriety by reporting research results which seriously question current wisdom. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) conducted what must be considered the largest long term prospective psychological health study. They followed around 20,000 probands for 15 years in order to determine the relative contributions to health outcomes (primarily cancer and CHD) of standard medical and psycho-social risk factors. They reported an 81% accuracy of prediction of death by cancer or CHD with the use of a psychometric test. Further, answers to the test were reported to be six times more predictive of cancer or CHD than were any of the standard medical risk factors, either taken on their own or together. Being far in excess of claims made by any other researchers, the treatment/prevention implications of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s study are far reaching. It is an important endeavor to examine possible influencing factors in these results. While scientific fraud can never be excluded, in the absence of any incriminating evidence, this assertion is considered to be non-empirical. Amelang (1991) wonders whether unknown, favourable and non replicable conditions were present in Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s samples or methodology which influenced the results. The current research program represents an attempt to ascertain what some of those factors may have been. It is suggested here that Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s probands learnt of their cancer or CHD proneness in the course of the interview which formed the basis of the data collected in their study. Focusing on this aspect of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection methodology, the possibility of a large scale treatment effect emerges. The most psychologically vulnerable of his probands, having been stimulated by the interview process, may have ruminated and &#8216;catastrophized&#8217; over their health prospects during the ensuing years, thereby making themselves physiologically more vulnerable to the feared conditions. The possibility of probands being adversely influenced by the interview is tested in the current study with subjects being measured for changes in cancer/CHD risk perception and anxiety levels as a result of participation in the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek interview&#8217; format. In order to test this hypothesis, two studies were undertaken in which Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection method was replicated with 105 subjects. Subjects were assessed on a range of self report items prior to the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek&#8217; interview, and again post to this interview. They were assessed as to their beliefs about vulnerability to cancer and CHD; and their levels of anxiety in relation to contracting these conditions. Subject&#8217;s responses to learning of their &#8216;health prediction&#8217; according to Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s assessment tool were also measured via a heart rate monitor. Changes in subject&#8217;s self report measures and heart rate responses were noted and associations to the type of health prediction which they were given at the end of the interview was assessed. In the second study, the relative effects of family history, Neuroticism and time on disease risk perception and anxiety were studied via statistical analyses of self report measures. The results of this study do not support the notion of the interview having any adverse influence. Problems with the methodology and sample selection may have influenced the outcome. It is concluded that for these reasons, the current study did not represent a thorough test of the current hypothesis. Recommendations for a superior test of this hypothesis are made.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative perceptions of reality: dyslexia</field><field name="creator">Colgin, Clayton Shawn</field><field name="description">Master of Visual Arts</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dyslexia</field><field name="subject">painting</field><field name="subject">Picasso</field><field name="subject">Rauschenberg</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">Terry Orchard</field><field name="subject">Katharine Dowson</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of cool temperature on egg incubation, thermoregulation and physiological performance of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) : implications for conservation programmes</field><field name="creator">Besson, Anne Amelie</field><field name="description">Tuatara (Sphenodon spp.) were once widespread over both the North and the South Islands of New Zealand approximately 1000 years ago but are now restricted to offshore islands due to introduced predators and habitat destruction. The survival of tuatara is now threatened by climate change because of isolation on islands that prevent them from migrating to cooler regions, and by their limited capacity to adapt due to their long life span and low genetic diversity. The thermal suitability of cooler regions for future translocations could be the key for tuatara conservation. The overall aim of the study was to determine the effect of cool temperature on the physiology, behaviour and egg incubation of Cook Strait tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). As well answering specific questions about tuatara and their adaptation to cool temperature this study aimed at answering general questions about the behavioural and evolutionary ecology of reptiles.
I first compared the preferred body temperature, feeding responses and tolerance to cold temperature of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) with three lizard species that inhabit the Otago region of southern New Zealand: Hoplodactylus maculatus, Naultinus gemmeus and Oligosoma maccanni. As well as testing the co-adaptation hypothesis between preferred body temperature and physiological performance of reptiles, I wanted to determine whether tuatara (which are planned to be reintroduced from a warmer site to the Otago region) have similar responses to cool temperature as do Otago lizard species. I found that tuatara show responses to cold temperatures similar to those of lizards from southern New Zealand, suggesting that if tuatara are translocated outside of their geographical range, they are likely to survive.
I then tested if tuatara were capable of modifying their thermoregulatory behaviour if translocated to a cooler region. To do so, I conducted a laboratory experiment in which tuatara were provided with three thermal treatments corresponding to the thermal environments they would experience in their current habitat and the proposed reintroduction site. Contrary to the prediction of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation, tuatara became active thermoregulators when the thermal quality of the habitat decreased. The results suggest that the model is less applicable to cold-adapted species and that if translocated to cooler regions, tuatara will be able to adjust their thermoregulatory behaviour to their thermal environment.
Tuatara are temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) reptiles and their translocation to cooler regions could have an dramatic impact on the sex ratio of new populations. To determine if potentially lower incubation temperature would be a limiting factor for the reintroduction of tuatara, I translocated eggs to the proposed reintroduction site. Some tuatara embryos developed at the site (and later hatched in the laboratory), but incubation lasted longer than in natural nests and all hatchlings were female. This trend observed in biased sex ratio might change in the context of climate change as an increase of soil temperature by 3&#65533;C would allow the production of males at the proposed site.
The present study demonstrates that the translocation of tuatara further south, outside of their current geographical range, is possible and recommended. Tuatara show similar responses to cool temperatures compared with lizards that live in southern New Zealand, they can also adjust their thermoregulatory behaviour if translocated to cooler habitats, and tuatara embryos could potentially develop successfully in cooler regions. The greatest chance for the future survival of tuatara and TSD species in general, lies in translocation to other locations that are thermally suitable.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tuatara</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">eggs</field><field name="subject">incubation</field><field name="subject">effect of temperature</field><field name="subject">body temperature</field><field name="subject">cold adaptation</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Stephens Island</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090713.160643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compassion, Jesus and Luke - words and deeds in a redaction-compositional study of Luke 6:12-8:3</field><field name="creator">Waldie, Kevin James</field><field name="description">Luke's gospel is not infrequently referred to as the gospel of mercy. This declaration has rarely, if at all, been seriously subjected to a critical investigation of its validity and the appropriateness of such a nomenclature. In particular, there has been little recognition of subtle and significant distinctions that can be made between mercy and compassion. This thesis therefore seeks to lay bare how the evangelist employed gospel source materials and his own literary talent to create and compose a sequence of narrative moments that lends itself to what is proposed here, especially a proper articulation of compassion as revealed by Luke's Jesus.
Limiting its broader investigative focus to Lk 3:1-9:50 this study is primarily interested in Lk 6:36, its role within the oft neglected Sermon on the Plain (Lk 6:20-49), its significance for the content and composition of Lk 7, and then secondarily its connection with the narrative blocks found either side of Lk 6-7, where of particular note is the programmatic sermon of Lk 4:16-30. In this purview a keen eye on detail and patterns relative to word(s) and deed(s) makes it possible to discern certain key theological and Christological authorial assumptions.
Specifically, it is through this purposeful depiction of God and Jesus in relation to humankind that Luke insightfully initiates the reader into the mission and ministry of the Christ and his chosen disciples. Observing closely what this Jesus says and does sheds light on the import of extended meaning attaching itself to Luke's writing.
To comprehend this better it proves helpful to analyse the meaning and force of Lk 6:36 in its Sermon context, in Luke's larger narrative and within the broad spectrum of ideas that derive from biblical, linguistic, philosophical and theological discussions. Lk 6:36 in translation thus becomes the point of departure for a more expansive treatment of this sometimes elusive theme.
Attempting to find the right, appropriately nuanced word in English helps establish an appreciation for the richer strands of meaning that attach to the mercy/compassion realm of language and that with certain conditioning have been either overshadowed or lost sight of altogether. Acquiring that orientation to the biblical concept evoked by Lk 6:36 can only be gained by an investigation that attentively inspects the palette of Hebrew and Greek terminology. A surprising array of interconnected yet distinct words, emphases and associations of image come as a result.
When closely examined alongside the linguistic and historical data Luke's composition confirms that the "compassion" Jesus voices / enacts is thoroughly relational; at its core is a personal, life-giving parent-child kinship; God is its primary reference point (invoking the notions of imitatio Dei, imago Dei); its paradigm figure is Jesus whose words and deeds integrally reveal its extravagant, boundary-free, risk-laden outreach to human beings of all sorts; and by natural inclination it redresses suffering and oppression without impossible conditions. To be, feel and act for another in this way is measured ultimately not by a human but a divine standard.
The investigative method of this thesis is a redaction-critical / composition-critical analysis of Lukan gospel material where "compassion" is best examined, defined and demonstrated. As a matter of course this approach accepts that Luke is both redactor of received materials (holding to the majority hypothesis on Synoptic sources) and author of a narrative with its own foci, emphases and theological character. Thus to define "compassion" through the words and deeds of the Lukan Jesus is to enter a narrative world virtually unexplored until now.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compassion</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">christianity</field><field name="subject">Sermon on the mount</field><field name="subject">Bible N.T.

Many measurements have been made over time of the ratio of the concentrations of dissolved Cd to those of PO&#8324; (Cd/PO&#8324;) in the world ocean and this has become one of the best relationships documented between a trace metal and a nutrient. Combined with the measurements of the Cd/Ca ratio in foraminifera, the Cd/PO&#8324; ratio has been used to reconstruct the oceanographic circulation patterns that existed during past glacial periods and hence provides information on past climate changes.
In the present study Cd/PO&#8324; ratios of the Southern Indian Ocean in surface and deep waters were investigated. The slopes of the relationships between Cd and PO&#8324; concentrations in waters of this region are high compared to the global correlations, and lie between those reported for other parts of the Southern Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. In surface waters of the Southern Indian Ocean, Cd/PO&#8324; ratios decrease from regions exhibiting high nutrient-low chlorophyll (HNLC) characteristic in the south to oligotrophic waters further north. It is also found that particulate Cd plays an important role in regulating the high Cd/PO&#8324; ratios reported in waters south of the Polar Front.
Very low Cd/PO&#8324; ratios were measured in waters associated with the Subtropical Front southeast of New Zealand compared to other Southern Ocean and global oceanic waters. Seasonal variations in the Cd/PO&#8324; ratios measured for these waters strongly suggest they are associated with a significant biological uptake of dissolved Cd particularly during the phytoplankton growth season in summer.
Dissolved Fe concentrations in the Southern Indian Ocean and seasonal variations of Fe in waters off the Otago Coast (southeast of New Zealand) suggest that Fe may stimulate phytoplankton growth and this might result in lower Cd/PO&#8324; ratios in surface waters through enhanced Cd uptake relative to PO&#8324; by the phytoplankton. However there is no distinct relationship between dissolved Fe concentrations and the dissolved Cd/PO&#8324; ratios measured in these surface waters. This finding is in disagreement with the recent 2006 hypothesis put forward by J.T. Cullen, which proposed that waters exhibiting low dissolved Cd/PO&#8324; ratios were associated with the HNLC regions. From a consideration of the potential Zn concentrations calculated from Si concentration measurements reported for these waters, it would appear that Zn may play a more important role than Fe in regulating Cd/PO&#8324; ratios in these waters.
Measurements of dissolved and total Cd concentrations relative to those of PO&#8324; were also undertaken in the Otago Harbour and immediate surrounding coastal waters. These exhibited higher Cd concentrations and higher Cd/PO&#8324; ratios than open ocean waters further off the Otago Coast. The particulate Cd concentrations showed a negative correlation with Cd concentrations measured in cockle species (Austrovenus stuchburyi) collected in the harbour, suggesting that particulate Cd is not the source of Cd measured in the tissue of this species.
The concentrations of Cd and other trace metals were also measured in samples of green mussel (Perna canaliculus), ribbed mussel (Aulacomya atra maoriana) and oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) collected from Otago Harbour and possible correlations explored between these concentrations and other parameters such as the shellfish condition indices and environmental gradients in the harbour.
In summary, measurements of dissolved and particulate Cd concentrations in the water column can provide unique information on a number of processes occurring in the global marine environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">phosphates</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">shellfish</field><field name="subject">water pollution</field><field name="subject">Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">South Pacific Ocean</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090728.100026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rights of the young person in the New Zealand youth justice family group conference</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Nessa</field><field name="description">The youth justice family group conference (FGC) is a statutory decision making process whereby the young person, their family/whanau, state officials and the victim of the offence come together to decide on a response to offending by that young person. The FGC is an integral part of the youth justice system, involving thousands of young people and their families each year.
There is a considerable amount of literature available on the youth justice FGC, most notably in regard to the purported restorative justice nature of the process. However, for a legal process which involves so many young people on a daily basis, there is little information available on the due process rights of young people in the FGC. This thesis seeks to remedy this gap in the research knowledge.
Firstly, this thesis establishes the theoretical framework for the rights of the young person in the youth justice system. The historical context and theoretical justification for these rights is considered, and the benchmarks for rights coming from international and national human rights standards are identified. A key theoretical issue is the application of rights to the FGC. It is argued that although the FGC differs in format from the adversarial criminal process, it remains a state process involved in resolving a breach of the criminal law, and thus the young person's rights should be safeguarded.
Secondly, this thesis evaluates legislation, policy and practice relating to the rights of the young person in the FGC. Three key areas of rights are considered: legal assistance, how the offence is proved, and outcomes of the FGC. Reference is made to practice examples derived from observation of the FGC in two centres in New Zealand.
Finally, as the FGC is certain to remain an integral part of the youth justice system, recommendations are made as to how legislation and practice could be improved to better safeguard the rights of young people in this process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children Young Persons and their Families Act 1989</field><field name="subject">juvenile justice</field><field name="subject">juvenile delinquents</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">family counseling</field><field name="subject">victims of crime</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090728.105833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation biology of bottlenose dolphins in Fiordland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Currey, Rohan J. C</field><field name="description">The bottlenose dolphins of Fiordland, New Zealand, live at the southern limit of the species' worldwide range. They are exposed to impacts from tourism and habitat modification, particularly in Doubtful Sound, and their conservation requirements are presently unclear. Dolphin abundance was estimated in Doubtful Sound using photo-identification census and capture-recapture techniques (56 individuals; 95% CI: 55-57), detecting a decline of 34-39% over 12 years among adults and sub-adults (&gt;3 years old). The cause of this decline was investigated via demographic modelling in Doubtful Sound and a comparative assessment of population status in Dusky Sound.
Capture-recapture modelling of photo-identification data compiled since 1990 yielded a constant adult survival rate marginally lower than prior estimates for wild bottlenose dolphins ([phi]a(1990-2008) = 0.9374; 95% CI: 0.9170-0.9530). Survival of calves (&lt;1 year old) declined to an unsustainable level that is thought to be the lowest recorded for wild bottlenose dolphins ([phi]c(2002-2008) = 0.3750; 95% CI: 0.2080-0.5782) coincident with the opening of a second tailrace tunnel for a hydroelectric power station. Reverse-time capture-recapture modelling detected declines in recruitment (f(1994-2008) = 0.0249; 95% CI: 0.0174-0.0324) and population growth ([lambda](1994-2008) = 0.9650; 95% CI: 0.9554-0.9746) over time consistent with the decline in calf survival (&lt;1 year old) and a separate reduction in juvenile survival (1 to 3 years old) reflecting cumulative impacts.
Dolphin abundance was estimated in Dusky Sound using photo-identification census and capture-recapture techniques (102 individuals, 95% CI: 100-104) providing no evidence of interchange with Doubtful Sound. A comparative assessment of health status between Doubtful and Dusky Sounds revealed skin lesioning was more severe in Doubtful Sound, particularly among females, and newborn calves appeared to be smaller and were born over a shorter period: factors that may contribute to the low levels of calf survival in Doubtful Sound. The Fiordland bottlenose dolphins were assessed under IUCN Red List regional criteria. The small size of the population (205 individuals, 95% CI: 192-219) combined with the projected rate of decline in stochastic matrix models (average decline 31.4% over one generation) resulted in a recommended classification of Critically Endangered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bottlenose dolphin</field><field name="subject">habitat</field><field name="subject">effects of human beings</field><field name="subject">Fiordland</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090730.141243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biology of Dendrogaster (Crustacea, Ascothoracida), parasitic in sea stars from Otago, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Penny L</field><field name="description">Little is known of the biology of the parasite Dendrogaster (Crustacea: Ascothoracida), an obligate endoparasite of sea stars. There are some 25 species of Dendrogaster reported worldwide. The highly modified females live within the coelomic cavity of the host, and heterochronous males are parasitic within the mantle cavity of the female. Two sea star species from the Otago Coast were found to be infected with two species of Dendrogaster. These parasite populations were studied from July 1993 to December 1994 to investigate specific aspects of their biology and the interactions between these parasites and their hosts.
The parasite found in Allostichaster insignis (Asteridae) was identified as Dendrogaster argentinensis Grygier and Salvat 1984, and Asterodon miliaris (Odontasteridae) was found to contain a previously unknown species, herein described and named Dendrogaster otagoensis n. sp. The structure and function of the mantle of female Dendrogaster sp were determined using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The ultrastructure of the mantle is modified, sharing characteristics found in Rhizocephala (Crustacea: Cirripedia), copepods, and Ulophysema oeresundense (Ascothoracida: Dendrogasteridae), which enable these crustaceans to absorb nutrients. Such modifications include a very thin, crenulated epicuticle, a soft, unscleratinised procuticle, and infoldings of the apical plasma membrane. In Dendrogaster the gut is likely to retain the capacity to absorb nutrients.
In general, aspects of infestation of Dendrogaster argentinensis and D. otagoensis are the same. Prevalence of Dendrogaster sp. in Otago sea stars is high and parasitism occurs throughout the year. Seventy-seven point five percent of Asterodon miliaris are infected with D. otagoensis and 97.4% of Allostichaster insignis are infected with D. argentinensis. Up to 144 females are found in a single host, and as many as 34 males in a single female. Mean number of parasites per host changes little over time, but began to decrease in D. argentinensis towards the end of the sample period. The female population is dominated by small individuals, with maximum size likely to depend on space available within the host. Males achieve a large size quickly, but their growth is also restricted by the size of the female they are within. The size and number of females per host are not related to size of the host. Females acquire new males and males grow larger with an increase in female size. Males occur in females of all reproductive stages, but occur with the greatest frequency in brooding females. Reproduction is spread evenly through females in less heavily infected hosts, and there is a reduction in mean size of females as the number of females per host increases, indicative of the crowding effect. Three indices of aggregation show that both sexes of Dendrogaster are highly aggregated in their hosts, with few hosts harbouring most of the parasites.
Dendrogaster is a parasitic castrator. Infected hosts have parasite loads ranging from 0.1% - 112% total sea star wet weight. Infected sea stars have smaller pyloric caecae and gonads, however, no gonads were present in uninfected Allostichaster insignis. Effect on the gonads and pyloric caecae increases as parasite load increases. Rather than directly affecting the germinal tissue of the host, Dendrogaster castrates its host indirectly through crowding and/or competitive castration. This castration is variable among hosts in Asterodon miliaris, but is important in Allostichaster insignis. The presence of D. argentinensis in A. insignis is associated with an increase in the incidence of asexual reproduction among larger (R&gt;25mm) individuals. Specific growth rates of intact and regenerating arms in fed and starved A. insignis are lower in infected individuals.
Larvae are brooded in the mantle cavity of the female until reaching the infective, swimming ascothoracid II stage. The larval development of Dendrogaster argentinensis and D. otagoensis is abbreviated. Larvae moult directly from the egg into the metanauplius. Metanauplii moult into ascothoracid I stage, which moult into the ascothoracid II stage immediately upon release from the female. Ultrastructure confirms the putative sensory function of the lattice organs. Other larval cuticular structures are also sensory.
Histological examination revealed that Dendrogaster has unique system of ovulation among Crustacea. The ovarian membrane contains primary oocytes, early vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes, but not maturing oocytes, which are found outside the ovarian membrane. The ovarian membrane forms follicles from which vitellogenic oocytes burst into the surrounding mesodermal tissue. These oocytes mature within the mantle wall tissue until entering the mantle cavity, where they are fertilised. Ovaries are absent in most brooding females. Spermatogenesis takes place within the males posterior protrusions and is continuous. Dendrogaster are likely to be labile hermaphrodites, as sperm are found in 20% of ovaries. Female Dendrogaster display asynchronous reproduction, with females of all sizes at different stages throughout the year. Females within one host are also at different stages. Spermatogenesis is present in males of all sizes. The presence of spent males in some females is indicative of a females outliving the males.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dendrogaster</field><field name="subject">crustacea</field><field name="subject">starfishes</field><field name="subject">Otago</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090731.161951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory and instrumental characterisation of consumers perceptions of fresh baked flavour to provide direction for new product development</field><field name="creator">Heenan, Samuel Peter</field><field name="description">Freshness is a holistic attribute of a food product, with a meaning that most often includes how recently produced or harvested a food currently is and to what extent it has been preserved. Without knowledge of production date, consumers will judge perceived freshness by the sensory properties of foods. However, these properties are not easily identified and described, as they vary considerably between different product types. The objective of this thesis, was to determine the sensory properties that consumers most associate with baked product freshness, and to determine the volatile composition responsible for "fresh-baked" flavour. In addition, relationships were determined and modelled between volatile composition, sensory properties and perceived freshness, in order to predict perceived freshness without the need for further consumer testing.
Two consumer studies were carried, where perceived freshness of 10 breads, 5 cakes and 5 biscuits was measured based on appearance, flavour and texture, and by product odour only. Individual differences in perceived freshness were represented on two-dimensional Freshness Maps generated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Consumers used similar terms to describe product freshness, but different terms were associated with specific product types. An understanding of the sensory characteristics associated with perceived freshness was determined by examining relationships between perceived freshness and descriptive analysis (DA). Sensory characteristics perceived to convey freshness in one product type did not necessarily convey freshness in another.
Further relationships between perceived freshness and sensory characteristics were determined for 20 bread types. Descriptive analysis was carried out with all breads, whereas perceived freshness was measured for 10 of these. Three consumer clusters were identified that were homogenous in their freshness perceptions, indicating that perceived bread freshness varied among consumers. Perceived freshness of breads not evaluated by consumers, but assessed by descriptive sensory analysis, were predicted for each consumer cluster using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Most fresh breads were described as having "porous" appearance, "floury", "toasted" and "malty" odour, "sweet", "buttery", and "oily" flavour, and "sweet" aftertaste. Least fresh breads were described as "musty" odour, "sour" flavour and "sour" aftertaste. In addition, Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) measured the volatile composition of all 20 bread types. Thirty-three mass ions significantly discriminated between bread types. Relationships were determined between odour and flavour sensory attributes, and mass spectral data using 15 of the 20 breads. PLSR models predicted the sensory properties and perceived freshness of all breads including five types not included in the construction of models. Bread perceived to be most fresh shared a similar combination of positively correlated mass ions, m/z 87, 97 and 117, also represented by "dairy" odour and "buttery" flavour, whilst the masses m/z 63, 69 and 91 were negatively associated with bread freshness, represented by the sensory attributes "grain", and "musty" odour, and "sour" flavour.
The influence of sweetener, fat type and time from baking on perceived freshness was determined for cakes. Four sweeteners (sucrose, glucose, xylitol, isomaltose), three fat types (butter, margarine, shortening) and two times from baking (days zero and 15) were investigated. Descriptive analysis was carried out using a trained panel, and volatile composition of measured using PTR-MS. Twelve cake samples with the largest sensory variation were further selected for consumer testing for perceived freshness. Results demonstrated that sweetener type, fat type, time from baking and their interaction significantly influenced the sensory properties, volatile composition, and perceived freshness of cakes. There was no evidence of perceived freshness segmentation among consumers. Perceived freshness of the twelve cakes not evaluated by consumers was predicted using sensory properties, volatile composition, and their combination. The freshest cakes were evaluated on the day of baking, and contained a combination of margarine and sucrose, and butter and sucrose. The least fresh cakes were evaluated after 15 days of storage and contained a combination of shortening and isomaltose, and butter and isomaltose. The most fresh samples were positively correlated with mass ions m/z 124, 74, 97 and 93, and sensory characteristics of "buttery" odour, and "buttery", "eggy" flavour. The least fresh samples were negatively correlated with mass ions m/z 110 and 95, and sensory characteristics of "rancid", "dusty" and "fatty" odour. Best predictions were obtained for cakes evaluated on day zero that contained a combination of shortening and sucrose.
This research established an objective knowledge of consumers' perceived freshness of baked product types in terms of sensory properties and volatile composition. This approach enabled the understanding of ingredients and time from baking influences, as well their interaction on baked product freshness. The predictive models developed that examined relationships between PTR-MS spectra, sensory characteristics and consumer perceived freshness can be applied to predict freshness of baked products not assessed by consumers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flavor</field><field name="subject">baked products</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">taste</field><field name="subject">testing</field><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">shelf-life dating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090805.144153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Home truths : understanding the key motives that underlie consumer home choice</field><field name="creator">Khoo-Lattimore, Cathryn Suan chin</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to identify the motivating factors driving consumers home purchase decisions from the consumer's point of view. Although there is an abundance of past real estate research, dating back as far as the 1920's, the factors shaping consumers home choice have not been fully explored. Past research has tended to assume that homebuyers arrive at a decision following a logical and rational decision making process. These studies have also tended to focus on utilitarian or economic factors shaping home choice. Although past research has unquestionably added to the understanding of home purchase behaviour, the focus on utilitarian and economic factors does not explain decisions that are underpinned by deep-seated motives. The present thesis extends past research by exploring the less tangible, non-economic aspects of home choice in order to provide a fuller story of why and how people consume homes.
The primary aim of this study was to investigate the unsolicited motives underlying consumers' home choices, therefore, a qualitative technique known as ZMET was employed. Based on the notion of unconscious thoughts, ZMET uses visual images gathered and/or generated by consumers to elicit and probe the metaphors that represent their thoughts and feelings. For the present study, 14 consumers who had recently placed an offer on a home took part in the ZMET interview. The present methodology extends past property research which has predominantly taken a quantitative approach.
The findings of the study provide a rich insight into the motivations behind consumer home choice. Firstly, it reveals that the pre-purchase checklists used by many homebuyers and real estate agents are inaccurate representation of consumer home choice, and explains why this is so. Secondly, it demonstrates the influence of twenty four motives, including three central constructs (space, nature and views) on consumer home choice and highlights the fact that autobiographical memories underpins many of the motives to impact on choice. Thirdly, it provides a model mapping out the interaction between utilitarian and hedonic motives, which evokes a network of feelings, sensations and emotions that shape consumer home choice. In doing so, the research provides theoretical insight into the link between the rational information-processing model and the experiential view of hedonic consumption in home purchases. This study has shown that a specific set of utilitarian and deep-seated hedonic factors interrelate to culminate upon one's home choice. The findings in this study maintain that while utilitarian factors are significant determinants of home choice, in themselves, they do not always tell the whole story.
This new knowledge of how and why homebuyers chose what they did is valuable to practitioners in predicting accurate property demands and value. Real estate agents can-sell more effectively by matching a property to a homebuyer's hedonic needs. The information in this study also helps homebuyers understand that their home choice is guided by internal images and deep-seated motives derived from many years of past experience but more importantly, they can decide if these motives justify the price they pay for the property. Finally, the model gives future researchers a new framework to access meanings necessary for understanding homebuyer choice and allows a closer examination of the mechanics of these influences on the housing market and its demands.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">house buying</field><field name="subject">consumers' preferences</field><field name="subject">residential real estate</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090807.144732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant-arthropod interactions : domatia and mites in the genus Coprosma (Rubiaceae)</field><field name="creator">O'Connell, Dean Michael</field><field name="description">Plant-based defence mutualisms involve aspects of plant morphology that influence the performance of plant parasites, their natural enemies and trophic interactions. Leaf domatia, small indentations on the underside of leaves, can be structurally complex, and are often inhabited by potentially beneficial mites and other arthropods. Plant morphological traits such as domatia that enhance mutualistic relationships may result in increased plant growth rates, and reproductive success. New Zealand supports ~60 plant species that have domatia, the most speciose genus being Coprosma. The aim of this thesis was to examine factors that affect the production of leaf domatia and their relationship with foliar mite assemblages. The three main objectives of this thesis are: First, to investigate the production of foliar domatia and their susceptibility to limited resources, particularly to carbon availability. Second, to test if domatia are inducible structures during leaf ontogeny in the presence of foliar mites and/or fungi. Finally, to explore the effect of domatia availability on foliar mite assemblages on leaves with and without resident mites. This thesis tested the stated objectives using C. lucida, C. ciliata, C. foetidissima and C. rotundifolia, with a combination of field investigations and controlled manipulative experiments. The cost of domatia production was investigated using two field surveys and two controlled experiments. Under natural conditions the relationship between leaf morphology and domatia were measured in situ and across an altitudinal gradient. The experimental manipulations used carbon and nutrient stress, induced by temperature, light and fertilizer application. The second objective was experimentally tested under field conditions by manipulating foliar mites and fungal densities on C. rotundifolia. The third objective was investigated by manipulating domatia availability on C. lucida shrubs across three different vegetation types. Under field conditions, the number of domatia per leaf was associated with leaf morphology in C. lucida and C. foetidissima, but not C. rotundifolia. Foliar carbon showed a positive, but weak association with domatia production in C. foetidissima and C. ciliata. Altitudinal induced-carbon stress on domatia production was ambiguous. Domatia production in C. foetidissima was positively associated to altitude in field survey (1), and negatively associated in the second survey, with no correlation found between carbon and altitude. Experimental C. rotundifolia shrubs held under elevated night-time temperatures showed a 2.5 fold increase in respiration, a 34% to 91% decrease in daily carbon gain, and 38% decrease in domatia per leaf mass. Domatia production showed no significant differences under nutrient stress. The results showed little evidence to support a role for induction of domatia. Domatia production in new leaves was similar across all experimental treatments. Diverse vegetation types supported 60% higher mite species. Leaves with domatia supported ~22 to 66% higher mite densities, greater colonisation success and more diverse mite assemblages, than those without domatia. In the pastoral vegetation, the absence of predatory mites on experimental shrubs resulted in no differences in fungivorous mite densities regardless of domatia availability. Plant investment in foliar domatia appears associated with the number of available sites on the leaf under field conditions. The role of carbon availability during leaf ontogeny suggests a complex and highly variable association with domatia production. Domatia are constitutive defence structures that influence mite assemblages, mediating both beneficial and antagonistic relationships. This thesis concludes that domatia are in part, carbon-based non-inducible structures that influence mite assemblages, plant-mite and mite-mite interactions, and increase the probability of successful colonisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coprosma</field><field name="subject">Rubiaceae</field><field name="subject">disease and pest resistance</field><field name="subject">plant mites</field><field name="subject">host plants</field><field name="subject">animal-plant relationships</field><field name="subject">leaves</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">mutualism (biology)</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090807.160026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sleeping Taniwha : exploring the practical utility of kaupapa Maori in firm performance</field><field name="creator">Ruwhiu, Diane</field><field name="description">This thesis takes the position that firm performance is derived from the value embodied by combinations of distinct socio-cultural resources and capabilities. In particular, this thesis explores practice in the context of Maori business to understand the mutual influences between economic exchange and social-cultural structures in terms of achieving improved firm performance. I begin by suggesting that much of the knowledge development and community practice in organisational analysis is subsumed within a Kuhnian conventionalism, which is not useful to gaining a deeper understanding of firm performance. I argue that what is required is an approach that emphasises the contextual development of society and organisation (embodied by social and cultural relations).
This brings to the fore the pragmatist epistemology of practical knowledge, an approach to research and analysis of organisations that is at the heart of this research. Practical knowledge connects to the pragmatic orientation of Indigenous logics in this instance kaupapa Maori, which draws us to a perspective of knowledge that is experiential, contextual, diverse and inclusive. The effectiveness of a practical knowledge perspective by means of its pragmatic epistemology allows us to understand Maori businesses operating within a distinctive frame of socio-economic rationality providing a broader utility leading to culturally constituted forms of practice. It was through this lens that I engaged with the proposition regarding firm performance prompting us to look at the field of leadership (habitus), exchange (inter-capital exchange) and relationships (field) in particular.
A major emphasis was a search for an appropriate method that would provide an avenue of authentic engagement with the cultural context embodied by kaupapa Maori. In terms of empirical investigation this thesis advances the utility of narrative as an expository technique and interpretive device that accords full recognition of Maori socio-cultural systems of relationships, historic circumstances and current practices. Conducted over three years (December 2004 and June 2006), the fieldwork component involved multiple strands of narrative in the form of dialogue, stories,metaphors, documentation and experiences of myself, other individuals and Maori economic development hui, or gathering.
A key finding of this thesis is that kaupapa Maori as expressed through business practice offers a practical utility in relation to the capability of and potential outcomes for improved firm performance. I argue that there are unique characteristics of Maori business practice, which are grounded in the epistemological stance of kaupapa Maori in combination with Western philosophies and techniques of organisation that contribute to the performance of Maori businesses. In addition, I argue that it offers a view of the organisation as something beyond a disembodied system of market exchange and recognises the embeddedness of social processes in each culture will bring specific cultural nuances to the formulation of what constitutes organisational success. Finally, I suggest that kaupapa Maori research, grounded by the epistemological and ontological assumptions of an Indigenous paradigm provides opportunities for gaining greater insight into the dynamics of organisation and management research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">commerce</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090810.161823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mt. Morning, Antarctica : geochemistry, geochronology, petrology, volcanology, and oxygen fugacity of the rifted Antarctic lithosphere</field><field name="creator">Martin, Adam Paul</field><field name="description">Mt. Morning is a 2,732 m high, Cenozoic, alkaline eruptive centre situated in the south-west corner of McMurdo Sound in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Mt. Morning is approximately 100 km south-west of Mt. Erebus, the world's southernmost active volcano. Several Cenozoic, alkali eruptive centres in this region make up the Erebus Volcanic Province. The region is currently undergoing continental extension. Regional-scale, north-striking faulting on the northern flank of Mt. Morning has offset vertical dykes, as young as 3.9 Ma, by up to 6 m dextrally. This is consistent with the trans-extensional regime in the region. The faults also have a dip-slip component, downthrown to the east. These faults define part of the western boundary of the West Antarctic Rift System. Mt. Morning straddles the boundary between the continental rift shoulder of the Transantarctic Mountains in Southern Victoria Land, and the perceived oceanic crust of the Ross Sea. Age determination of the youngest offset dyke constrains movement in the last 3.88 &#65533; 0.05 m.y., to an average rate of 0.0015 mm per year.
Volcanism on Mt. Morning is divided into two phases. Phase I was erupted between 18.7 &#65533; 0.3 and 114 &#65533; 0.2 Ma and Phase II between 6.13 &#65533; 0.20 and 0.15 &#65533; 0.01 Ma. The two phases are separated by a 5.3 m.y. period of quiescence. The geochemistry of Phase I is mildly alkaline; it is composed of volcaniclastic deposits, dykes, sills, and volcanic plugs of nepheline-basanite, nepheline-trachyte, quartz-mugearite, quartz-trachyte, and rhyolite. Phase I rocks evolved along at least two trends: a quartz normative trend, and a nepheline normative trend. Chemical variation in Phase I can be explained in part by crystal fractionation, which has been modelled using major element multiple linear regression. Phase I quartz-mugearite can fractionate to quartz-trachyte after 44% crystallisation. Quartz-trachyte can fractionate to rhyolite after a further 6% erystallisation. The models indicate that clinopyroxene + plagioclase + opaque oxides &#65533; alkali feldspar &#65533; apatite are the dominant fractionated phases. Many of the Phase I quartz normative volcanic rocks have relatively high &#8312;&#8311;Sr/&#8312;&#8310;Sr ratios (0.70501), suggesting that assimilation, most likely of crustal material, has modified them. Phase I nepheline-basanite can fractionate to nepheline-trachyte after 68% crystallisation. Modelling indicates clinopyroxene + nepheline + olivine + opaque oxides are the dominant fractionated phases.
Phase II volcanic rocks are strongly alkaline and are mapped as flows, volcaniclastic deposits, dykes, and sills. They have been erupted mainly from parasitic scoria vents and rarely from fissure vents. Rock types include picrobasalt, basalt, basanite, tephrite, hawaiite, mugearite, phonotephrite, tephriphonolite, benmoreite, and phonolite. Chemical variations in the Phase II volcanic rocks can be explained by simple fractionation. Phase II picrobasalt can fractionate to phonotephrite after 78% crystallisation. Phonotephrite can fractionate to phonolite after at least 35% crystallisation, depending on which of several multiple linear regression models are selected. Fractionation is dominated by the removal of clinopyroxene + plagioclase + nepheline + olivine + opaque oxides &#65533; apatite &#65533; kaersutite. Volcanic rocks in the Erebus Volcanic Province are strongly alkaline on a silica versus total alkalis plot, similar to the Phase II volcanic rocks from Mt. Morning. Mildly alkaline rocks of Phase I are, to date, unique within the Erebus Volcanic Province.
Bulk rock isotope ratios of &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr (0.70307 - 0.70371 and 0.70498 - 0.70501), &#65533;&#8308;&#65533;Nd/&#65533;&#8308;&#8308;Nd (0.512650 - 0.512902), and &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&#65533;&#8304;&#8308;Pb (18.593 -20.039) show that the majority of Mt. Morning volcanic rocks lie on a mixing line between HIMU (high-[mu]; enriched in &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb and &#65533;&#8304;&#8312;Pb and relatively depleted in &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr values) and DM (depleted mantle; high &#65533;&#8308;&#65533;Nd/&#65533;&#8308;&#8308;Nd, low &#8312;&#8310;Sr/&#8312;&#8311;Sr, and low &#65533;&#8304;&#8310;Pb/&#65533;&#8304;&#8308;Pb). This is similar to the majority of volcanic rocks from the SW Pacific, including Antarctica and New Zealand. Mt. Morning volcanic rocks have tapped this broadly common mantle reservoir.
There are variations in radiogenic isotope ratios between Mt. Morning and Mt. Erebus. There are also differences between the incompatible element ratios in volcanic rocks from Mt. Morning, Mt. Erebus, and White Island (a third eruptive centre in the Erebus Volcanic Province), suggesting heterogeneity in the mantle beneath the Erebus Volcanic Province. Significant chemical differences are also noted between ultramafic xenoliths collected from Mt. Morning and from Foster Crater only 15 km away. This suggests a deca-kilometre, possibly even kilometre-scale, heterogeneity in the mantle. Such small-scale chemical differences appear difficult to reconcile with large-scale plume hypotheses for the initiation of volcanism in the Erebus Volcanic Province. Instead, volcanism is much more likely to be related to numerous small plumes, or the preferred hypothesis, metasomatism and amagmatic rifting, followed by decompression melting of upwelling mantle and volcanism during transtensional lithospheric rifting. This latter model is supported by a lack of regional updoming expected with a plume(s), and fits models of localised extension proposed in this thesis.
Calc-alkaline and alkaline igneous xenoliths, of felsic to mafic crustal material, have been collected from Mt. Morning. U-Pb geochronology (545.4 &#65533; 3.7 Ma and 518.6 &#65533; 4.4 Ma) on crustal xenoliths from Mt. Morning illustrate that the basement is Cambrian. Bulk rock chemistry of crustal xenoliths has similarities to compositions reported for Ross Orogen rocks, suggesting the Mt. Morning volcanic edifice is built on a basement that is composed of Cambrian Ross Orogen rock types. Quartz-bearing felsic granulite xenoliths with greater than 70 weight percent silica, collected from Mt. Morning, suggest that part of the basement is felsic. This is the only occurrence of felsic xenoliths reported to date east of the present day coastline of Victoria Land. Mt. Morning crops out less than 25 km from the known northern end of the Koettlitz Glacier Alkaline Province in the Transantarctic Mountains. The partially alkaline basement beneath Mt. Morning suggests the province may continue beneath part of Mt. Morning.
The mantle beneath Mt. Morning can be characterised as anhydrous and otherwise largely unmetasomatised, which is atypical of xenoliths collected from the western Ross Sea. Only a handful of Mt. Morning xenoliths show petrographic evidence of metasomatism, these include modal phlogopite, apatite, Fe-Ni sulphide, and plagioclase (in pyroxenite xenoliths), suggesting metasomatising fluids occur discretely in this region. Where present, the metasomatic fluid(s) beneath Mt. Morning are enriched in Ba, LREEs, Th, U, P, Fe, Ni, S, and K, and depleted in Ti relative to the metasomatic fluid composition described at nearby Foster Crater.
Oxygen fugacity (fO&#8322;) of the Antarctic shallow mantle has been measured from xenoliths collected from Mt. Morning, where fO&#8322; was demonstrated to be strongly dependant upon spinel Fe&#65533;&#8314; content that was measured using Mo&#776;ssbauer spectroscopy, and calculated from the olivine-orthopyroxene-spinel oxybarometer. fO&#8322; in the rifted Antarctic mantle varies between 0.1 and -1 log units relative to the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer and is coupled to melt depletion, with increasing degrees of melt extraction resulting in a more oxidised mantle. This range of upper mantle fO&#8322; is commonly observed in continental rift settings worldwide.
The mantle beneath Mt. Morning is composed of, in increasing degree of fertility, dunite, harzburgite, and lherzolite. Xenoliths representing discrete samples of this mantle have mostly crystallised in the spinel stability field of the mantle at pressures of approximately 15 kb and temperatures between 950 - 970 &#65533;C. Symplectites of spinel and pyroxene have been interpreted as petrographic evidence that some of the spinel peridotite originated in the garnet stability field of the mantle. Rare plagioclase-bearing spinel lherzolite (plagioclase lherzolite) is also present in the mantle beneath Mt. Morning, which crystallised at temperatures of between 885 and 935 &#65533;C at 5 kb. The Mt. Morning peridotite xenoliths plot along the pre-defined geotherm for the Erebus Volcanic Province, strongly supporting it as the appropriate choice of geothermal gradient for south-west McMurdo Sound.
Mineral and bulk rock compositions are nearly identical between the plagioclase lherzolite xenoliths and spinel lherzolite xenoliths. Mineral and bulk rock chemistry suggest it is unlikely that the plagioclase is due to metasomatism. Petrographic evidence and mass balance calculations suggest that the plagioclase lherzolite has crystallised via a sub-solidus (metamorphic) transition from spinel lherzolite upon decompression and upwelling of the mantle. The occurrence of plagioclase lherzolite beneath Mt. Morning could be explained by lithospheric scale uplift along faults that define the western margin of the West Antarctic Rift System. Plagioclase lherzolite has also been collected and described from White Island. White Island is also interpreted to straddle lithospheric scale faults. Rifting and buoyant uplift is sufficient to explain the presence of plagioclase lherzolite in the Erebus Volcanic Province. Plagioclase lherzolite has also been described from Mt Melbourne, an eruptive centre in Northern Victoria Land. Known occurrences of plagioclase lherzolite from the western shoulder of the Ross Sea now cover an area 430 km long and 80 km wide. This is one of the largest provinces of plagioclase peridotite worldwide so far reported.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology</field><field name="subject">volcanism</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">petrology</field><field name="subject">rifts (geology)</field><field name="subject">geological time</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Mount Morning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090812.090902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of international and New Zealand women in New Zealand higher education</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Vivienne</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on an ethnographic research project that explored the experiences and perspectives of a group of women in New Zealand higher education, including international and New Zealand students and partners of international students. The study had two aims. The first was to disrupt the inattention to gender and to students' partners and families in New Zealand international education research and policy. The second was to problematise Eurocentric assumptions of (predominantly Asian) international students' 'cultural difference', and of New Zealanders' homogenised sameness.
The theoretical framework for the study was informed by a range of conceptual tools, including feminist, critical theory, post-structural, and postcolonial perspectives. In drawing on feminist perspectives, the study was driven by a concern with acknowledging the importance and value of women's lives, looking for women where they are absent from policy and analysis, and attending to the mechanisms through which some women's lives are rendered invisible in internationalised higher education. In considering these mechanisms and women's lives in relation to them the study also drew on post-structural notions of discourse, power, and agency. It explored how dominant discourses in internationalised higher education reveal and reproduce historically-grounded relations of power that are intentionally or unintentionally performed, subverted and/or resisted by women and those they encounter. Using Young's (1990, 2000) approach to critical theory, the study also considered alternative ways of constructing internationalised higher education that were suggested in women's accounts.
As a critical feminist ethnography the study was shaped by my theoretical framework (above), critical literature on heterogeneous social groups, and feminist concerns with relationship, reciprocity and power in the research process. Fieldwork took place during 2005 and 2006 and involved two aspects: the establishment and maintenance of an intercultural group for women associated with a higher education institution, and 28 interviews with 20 women over two years. Interviewees were recruited through the group and included eight international students, nine New Zealand students and three women partners of international students.
Study findings challenged the assumption that international and local students are distinct and oppositional groups. They also highlighted the importance of recognising the legitimate presence of international students' partners and accompanying family members at all levels in higher education. International and New Zealand women alike found the intercultural group a useful source of social and practical support and information, and a point of access to other sources of support and information. Women reflected on moving between many different kinds of living and learning contexts, highlighting the importance of: clear processes and pathways for accessing information and practical support when experiencing transition; teaching that is engaging, effective, and responsive; and opportunities to develop connections with other people both on and off campus. Rather than revealing clear patterns of difference or sameness across women, the study highlighted the importance of policy, research, teaching and support practices that are open and responsive to women's actual viewpoints and needs, and that neither re-entrench difference nor assume sameness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women in higher education</field><field name="subject">women college students</field><field name="subject">foreign students</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">family relationships</field><field name="subject">spouses</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090812.101334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal genetic structuring in yellow-eyed penguins</field><field name="creator">Boessenkool, Sanne</field><field name="description">Improving our understanding of the forces driving population decline and the processes that affect the dynamics of threatened populations is central to the success of conservation management. The application of genetic tools, including our ability to examine ancient DNA, has now revolutionised our ability to investigate these processes. The recent human settlement of the Pacific, particularly in New Zealand, provides a unique, accessible system for revealing anthropogenic impacts on native biota. In this thesis I use genetic analyses from modern, historic and subfossil DNA to investigate temporal and spatial genetic structuring of the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), and use these analyses to answer questions related to the conservation of this species.
The yellow-eyed penguin is endemic to the New Zealand region and currently breeds on the subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands and the southeast coast of the South Island. The current total population size is estimated around 6000-7000 individuals, of which more than 60% inhabit the subantarctic. Despite intensive conservation measures by governmental and local community agencies, population sizes have remained highly unstable with strong fluctuations in numbers on the South Island. The species was believed to be more widespread and abundant before human colonisation of New Zealand, thus current management assumed the mainland population to be a declining remnant of a larger prehistoric population.
Genetic and morphological analyses of subfossil, historic and modern penguin samples revealed an unexpected pattern of penguin extinction and expansion. Only in the last few hundred years did M. antipodes expand its range from the subantarctic to the New Zealand mainland. This range expansion was apparently facilitated by the extinction of M. antipodes' previously unrecognised sister species, M. waitaha, following Polynesian settlement in New Zealand. The demise of M. waitaha is the only known human-mediated extinction of a penguin species.
Despite M. antipodes' recent range expansion, genetic analyses of microsatellite markers reveal two genetically and geographically distinct assemblages: South Island versus subantarctic populations. We detected only two first generation migrants that had dispersed from the subantarctic to the South Island, suggesting a migration rate of less than 2%. Moreover, the South Island population has low genetic variability compared to the subantarctic population. Temporal genetic analyses of historic and modern penguin specimens further revealed that the harmonic mean effective population size of the M. antipodes South Island population is low (&lt;200). These findings suggest that the South Island population was founded by only a small number of individuals, and that subsequent levels of gene flow have remained low.
Finally, we present a novel approach to detect errors in historic museum specimen data in cases where a priori suspicion is absent. Museum specimens provide an invaluable resource for biological research, but the scientific value of specimens is compromised by the presence of errors in collection data. Using individual-based genetic analysis of contemporary and historic microsatellite data we detected eight yellow-eyed penguin specimens with what appear to be fraudulently labelled collection locations. This finding suggests errors in locality data may be more common than previously suspected, and serves as a warning to all who use archive specimens to invest time in the verification of specimen data.
Overall, yellow-eyed penguins have a remarkable dynamic history of recent expansion, which has resulted in two demographically independent populations. These results reveal that anthropogenic impacts may be far more complex than previously appreciated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yellow eyed penguin</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">speciation</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">evolutionary genetics</field><field name="subject">South Island</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090812.163749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kia Whakamaramatia Mahi Titi : predictive measures for understanding harvest impacts on Sooty Shearwaters (Puffinus griseus)</field><field name="creator">Clucas, Rosemary</field><field name="description">The sooty shearwater (also known as the muttonbird, Titi, Puffinus griseus) is a long-lived super-abundant, burrow nesting petrel, harvested by Rakiura Maori from breeding colonies, located in southern New Zealand. The harvest is culturally defining and enormously important for Rakiura Maori. The work in this thesis contributes to the Kia Mau te Titi Mo Ake Tonu Atu Research Project being undertaken by Rakiura Maori and the University of Otago, towards assessing ongoing sustainability of the harvest and future threats.
Analyses of eight muttonbirder harvest records spanning, 1938 to 2004, show that harvest rates demonstrate, systematic commonalities in seasonal patterns and broad-scale consistency in trends of chick abundance and quality across harvested islands. If co-ordinated and well replicated, harvest records offer Rakiura Maori a low-cost and effective monitoring tool of sooty shearwater reproductive success and long-term population abundance. Hunt tallies provide additional evidence of a dramatic reduction in sooty shearwater abundance from the late 1980s that was also detected by counts from boats off the western seaboard of the USA. A conservative estimate of overall decline in hunt success across diaries, for the period 1972 to 2004, is 1.89 % (CI&#8329;&#8325; 1.14 to 2.65) per annum, a total reduction of 39.2%. The harvesting records show a sooty shearwater mortality event occurred just prior to the 1993-breeding season at the same time as a severe negative anomaly in both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Southern Oscillation Indices. The hunting diaries show a decoupling of chick size with harvest success in the early 1990s. This resulted from a decline in harvest success and an increase in its variability, while chick size remained correlated with changing chick abundance and maintained its pre-1990 average. Long- lived seabirds maintain high survival by skipping breeding and abandoning breeding attempts when oceanic conditions deteriorate, increasing variability in chick abundance is also evidence of pressure on adult survivorship. The multiple diaries confirm these were major demographic events not confined to a single island.
My survival estimates for The Snares and Whenua Hou were very high 0.952 (0.896-0.979) compared to earlier estimates for this species. Transience at the colonies is high due to the presence ofjuvenile and pre-breeding birds. Both naturally high survival and the large number of transient pre-breeders indicate sooty shearwater are more resilient to harvest than earlier survival models suggested. There was no evidence for directional change in sooty shearwater breeding phenology over 49-years of harvest. Climate fluctuation/change is therefore apparently not altering egg-laying. Peak fledging occurred fairly consistently in the 2nd of May (IQR = 2.91 days). Yearly variability in emergence occurs primarily due to provisioning and localized fledging conditions. Larger chick size was strongly correlated with delayed fledging and is consistent with the traditional ecological knowledge of the birders. There was no evidence for chicks becoming smaller or that years with starving chicks were more common, so increasing mismatch of breeding with optimal forage was not indicated.
The past proportion of birders over the last 20 years (1985 - 2005) has been ~2% all of Rakiura Maori. Approximately 376 birders participated in the 2006 season with an estimated of overall harvest intensity 19.4% (CI&#8329;&#8325; = 13.8 - 24.2%) and a total catch of 381,000 (CI&#8329;&#8325; = 262,257 - 487,186) chicks. This study found evidence that catch rates reduced with increasing birder competition partially mitigating effects on harvest pressure. The combined effects of potential climate change on bird abundance and increased harvester competition suggests that the proportion of Rakiura Maori whom choose to bird is likely to decrease as tallies reduce and cost recovery becomes more difficult. Rakiura Maori have for many years cherished and maintained their islands and implemented protective measures to safeguarded titi breeding habitat. Future harvest management will have additional issues to contend with, but Rakiura Maori are necessarily confronting these issues as the titi culture rests on the maintenance of their taonga. The information presented in this thesis shows that combining science and traditional knowledge is a powerful tool for managing harvest sustainability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">hunting</field><field name="subject">sooty shearwater</field><field name="subject">bird populations</field><field name="subject">estimates</field><field name="subject">counting</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">population biology</field><field name="subject">Southland</field><field name="subject">Muttonbird (Titi) Islands</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090813.140751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population modelling of albatrosses and petrels with minimal demographic information</field><field name="creator">Dillingham, Peter W</field><field name="description">There are hundreds of thousands of fisheries-related mortalities of seabirds each year. Population trends for these species are highly influenced by changes in adult survival, their maximum growth rates are low, and little additional mortality can have a large impact on the population. As a result, many albatrosses and petrels are at risk of extinction, but limited demographic data makes it difficult to quantify the risk for many species. The goal of this research is to use population modelling tools to assess potential impacts with minimal data. In particular, the question of how much additional mortality a population can sustain is addressed when there is only knowledge of the adult survival rate, age at first breeding, and the number of breeding pairs.
In this thesis, a simple decision rule designed for marine mammals is applied to albatrosses and petrels. In order to use this rule, adult survival, age at first breeding, a minimum estimate of the population size, and the maximum growth rate of the population are needed. While estimation of adult survival is well developed, work was required to calculate the other values from available data. A simple population model was developed to extrapolate from the number of breeding pairs to the total population size (given survival and age at first breeding); the effect of variable fecundity rates on the calculation of generation time and the maximum growth rate of a population was examined, relative to an estimate that only requires survival and age at first breeding; and a method for estimating the age at first breeding using capture-recapture data was suggested that accounts for study duration and emigration, in addition to capture probability.
This work can help managers make better informed decisions when little is known about a population. For example, around 5,800 pairs of Gibson's albatrosses (Diomedea gibsoni) breed each year. Based on the work presented in this thesis, they may be able to sustain 1,000 - 1,200 additional mortalities per year. However, given concern about their conservation status, a mortality level below 100 - 120 is desired, and any mortality beyond that level suggests a need for more intensive management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">albatrosses</field><field name="subject">petrels</field><field name="subject">sea birds</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">longlining (fisheries)</field><field name="subject">bird populations</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090813.152547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of fish biomass indices from catch-effort data : a likelihood approach</field><field name="creator">Roa-Ureta, Ruben</field><field name="description">Two dimensional stocks of fish can be assessed with methods that mimic the analysis of research survey data but that use commercial catch-effort data. This finite population approach has scarcely been used in fisheries science though it brings about very large sample sizes of local fish density with models of only moderate levels of complexity. The extracted information about the status of the stock can be interpreted as biomass indices.
Statistical inference on finite populations has been the locus of a highly specialized branch of sampling-distribution inference, unique because observable variables are not considered as random variables. If statistical inference is defined as "the identification of distinct sets of plausible and implausible values for unobserved quantities using observations and probability theory" then it is shown that Godambe's paradox implies that the classical finite populations approach is inherently contradictory as a technique of statistical inference. The demonstration is facilitated by the introduction of an extended canonical form of an experiment of chance, that apart from the three components identified by Birnbaum, also contains the time at which the experiment is performed. Realization of the time random variable leaves the likelihood function as sole data-based mathematical tool for statistical inference, in contradiction with sampling-distribution inference and in agreement with direct-likelihood and Bayesian inference.
A simple mathematical model is introduced for biomass indices in the spatial field defined by the fishing grounds. It contains three unknown parameters, the natural mortality rate, the probability of observing the stock in the area covered by the fishing grounds, and mean fish density in the sub-areas where the stock was present. A new theory for the estimation of mortality rates is introduced, using length frequency data, that is based on the population ecology analogue of Hamilton-Jacobi theory of classical mechanics. The family of equations require estimations of population growth, individual growth, and recruitment pattern. Well known or new techniques are used for estimating parameters of these processes. Among the new techniques, a likelihood-based geostatistical model to estimate fish density is proposed and is now in use in fisheries science (Roa-Ureta and Niklitschek, 2007, ICES Journal of Marine Science 64:1723-1734), as well as a new method to estimate individual growth parameters (Roa-Ureta, In Press, Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics).
All inference is done only using likelihood functions and approximations to likelihood functions, as required by the Strong Likelihood principle and the direct-likelihood school of statistical inference. The statistical model for biomass indices is a hierarchical model with several sources of data, hyperparameters, and nuisance parameters. Even though the level of complexity is not low, a full Bayesian formulation is not necessary. Physical factors, mathematical manipulation, profile likelihoods and estimated likelihoods are used for the elimination of nuisance parameters. Marginal normal and multivariate normal likelihood functions, as well as the functional invariance property, are used for the hierarchical structure of estimation. In this manner most sources of information and uncertainty in the data are carried over up the hierarchy to the estimation of the biomass indices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fisheries</field><field name="subject">catch effort</field><field name="subject">fish populations</field><field name="subject">estimates</field><field name="subject">fish stock assessment</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090818.150508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterosynaptic metaplasticity in area CA1 of the hippocampus</field><field name="creator">Hulme, Sarah R</field><field name="description">Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an activity-dependent increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission. In concert with long-term depression (LTD), this synaptic plasticity likely underlies some types of learning and memory. It has been suggested that for LTP/LTD to act as effective memory storage mechanisms, homeostatic regulation is required. This need for plasticity regulation is incorporated into the Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) theory by a threshold determining LTD/LTP induction, which is altered by the previous history of activity (Bienenstock et al., 1982). The present work aimed to test key predictions of the BCM model. This was done using field and intracellular recordings in area CA1 of hippocampal slices from young, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The first prediction tested was that following a strong, high-frequency priming stimulation all synapses on primed cells will show inhibition of subsequent LTP and facilitation of LTD induction (heterosynaptic metaplasticity). This was confirmed using two independent Schaffer collateral pathways to the same CA1 pyramidal cells. Following priming stimulation to one pathway, LTP induction was heterosynaptically inhibited and LTD facilitated. To more fully investigate whether all synapses show metaplastic changes, the priming stimulation was given in a different dendritic compartment, in stratum oriens, prior to LTP induction in stratum radiatum. This experiment supported the conclusion that all synapses show inhibited LTP following priming. A second prediction of the BCM model is that metaplasticity induction is determined by the history of cell firing. To investigate this, cells were hyperpolarized during priming to completely prevent somatic action potentials. Under these conditions inhibitory priming of LTP was still observed, and thus somatic action potentials are not critical for the induction of the effect. The next aim was to determine the mechanism underlying heterosynaptic metaplasticity. One way in which plasticity induction can be altered is through changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition of pyramidal cells. For this reason, it was tested whether blocking all GABAergic inhibition, for the duration of the experiment, would prevent priming of LTP. However, priming inhibited subsequent LTP and it was concluded that GABAergic changes do not underlie either the induction, or expression, of the metaplastic state. Proposed revisions to the BCM model predict that postsynaptic elevations in intracellular Ca&#65533;&#8314; determine the induction of metaplasticity. There are many potential sources for postsynaptic Ca&#65533;&#8314; elevations, including entry through N-methyl-D-asparate receptors (NMDARs) or voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), or release from intracellular stores. Results of the present work demonstrate that the inhibition of LTP is dependent on the release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from intracellular stores during priming; however this release is not triggered by Ca&#65533;&#8314; entry through NMDARs or VDCCs, or via activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Overall, the present results show that, in accordance with the BCM model, a high level of prior activity induces a cell-wide metaplastic state, such that LTD is facilitated and LTP is inhibited. In contrast to predictions of the BCM model, this is not mediated by cell-firing during priming. Instead the release of Ca&#65533;&#8314; from intracellular stores is critical for induction of the metaplastic state.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuroplasticity</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">hippocampus (brain)</field><field name="subject">cerebral cortex</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">nervous system</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090818.161738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social functioning of children and adolescents with ADHD : communication functioning and social problem solving as possible underlying mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Shelly Ann</field><field name="description">Children and young people with ADHD often experience social difficulties, which are associated with poor psychological, behavioural, and academic outcomes. As yet, underlying mechanisms of poor social functioning are unknown. The social functioning of fifty-two children (M = 14.13 years) who had been diagnosed with ADHD four years previously and their matched controls were assessed using several measures: the ratings of parents/guardians and teachers, and children's self-reports; a conversation task; the Otago Social Dilemma Test. Analyses were conducted for the whole sample plus a Socially-Impaired subgroup (clinically significant social problems), and a Persistent-ADHD subgroup (continued to meet DSM-IV ADHD criteria).
First we compared the social functioning of children in the ADHD group with that of children in the control group by analysing the questionnaire responses of parents/guardians, teachers, and children's self-reports. Children in the ADHD group and Socially-Impaired sub-group were rated as experiencing more social problems and having fewer social skills than control children, across all informants. Children also estimated their own popularity, and despite experiencing social difficulties, no differences in children's popularity ratings were observed between children in the ADHD group and control group.
Given that children in the ADHD group showed social difficulties, we investigated whether these deficits were driven by children's conversation skills. Children engaged in a 15-minute conversation with an adult confederate. The frequency of conversation skills were coded and analysed. Across all groups, ADHD children asked more questions, were less likely to offer extended information in response to a question, and were more likely to make at least one unco-operative statement. The number of extended verbal responses accounted for a significant amount of the variance in participants' social skills. Overall, however, the conversations of children with and without ADHD were remarkably similar. It appears, therefore, that it may be language style that influences social difficulties.
Next we investigated a second mechanism that might account for social difficulties observed in children with ADHD; social problem solving skills. Children completed the Otago Social Dilemma Test, which involved viewing vignettes of social dilemmas and generating possible solutions to these problems. Children in the ADHD group provided poorer descriptions and showed less understanding of the problems portrayed. Although the ADHD participants were able to generate a similar number of solutions to the social problems as the children in the Control group, they made poorer decisions about what was the 'best solution'. ADHD participants' choice for best solution significantly added to a model of their social problems, even after IQ and severity of inattentive symptoms had been added.
Taken together, the present study supports research showing that children with ADHD experience social difficulties, but they may lack insight into the effect of their behaviour on their status among peers. Children's conversation and their problem solving abilities may be factors influencing poor social functioning. Interventions that focus on teaching children to recognise social cues and generate appropriate solutions to social dilemmas may be beneficial.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">attention-deficit-disordered children</field><field name="subject">social skills in children</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">social interaction in children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090819.110407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for 'self' for lifestyle travellers</field><field name="creator">Cohen, Scott Allen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the search for self in the context of lifestyle travellers. It has been suggested that maintaining a coherent sense of self has become problematic in late modernity as the socially constructed notion of a 'true self' has come to be regarded as concrete, whilst choice has increasingly replaced obligation or tradition as a basis in defining selves. Issues of self have been noted as especially important in the context of adopted lifestyles, as lifestyle can be a means through which individuals seek coherence in their lives. Furthermore, travelling to 'find one's self' has a lengthy tradition in popular literature that has also been reflected in tourism studies where research has been conducted into backpacker and traveller identities.
Lifestyle travel is a post-traditional way of life wherein individuals are voluntarily exposed to an array of cultural praxes. Thus, the literatures on self, lifestyle and tourism point to lifestyle travel as a context where issues of self may be particularly relevant. Whilst there is a significant and growing body of research within tourism studies on backpackers, there is a dearth of information on individuals that travel as a lifestyle. Therefore, this thesis contributes to academic knowledge not only through its investigation into the search for self, but also by its conceptualisation of and empirical research into lifestyle travellers.
With criteria for defining lifestyle travellers based on of a fluid combination of self-definition of travel as one's lifestyle and multiple trips of approximately six months or more, twenty-five semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out by the researcher with lifestyle travellers in northern Indian and southern Thailand from July through September 2007. In keeping with the paradigmatic ideals of interpretivism, emergent themes were identified from within the qualitative material including meanings that the lifestyle travellers attached to the search for self, surrounding issues of avoidance and seeking that influenced why they travelled as a lifestyle and their future travel intentions.
Although there were multiple perspectives on how the search for self was conceived and approached, searching for self was voiced as a critical motivating factor for the majority of the lifestyle travellers. With a common view among most of the respondents of self as an internal object to be developed, many lifestyle travellers had been or were still on a Romantic modern quest of searching for their true self. Escapism, freedom and learning through challenge were identified as important themes surrounding the search for self, as lifestyle travellers described varying degrees of success in escaping their home societies and finding increased free space and time to learn about and challenge their ideas of self. Paradoxically, most of the lifestyle travellers sought to experience an inner self that dominant sociological views posit does not exist. The tension of searching for a unified sense of self in a world of relational selves is highlighted as not only problematic for the interviewees, but also for previous tourism studies that have premised their contributions on the existence of an inner self.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">lifestyles</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">backpacking</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">travel</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090819.151427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical pharmacology of aminoglycosides in neonates</field><field name="creator">Sherwin, Catherine M. T</field><field name="description">The aims of this Thesis were to investigate early markers of neonatal sepsis and patient-factors affecting the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of aminoglycosides in the treatment of neonatal sepsis.
A prospective cohort study of neonates commenced on gentamicin for suspected sepsis was performed between 1 July 2002 and 28 February 2007. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) plots were used to assess potential markers of sepsis against culture positive sepsis. When sepsis was first suspected, the most promising tests were interleukin (IL) IL-12(p70) with an area under the curve (95% CI) for the ROC of 0.74 (0.63-0.86), and which (with a cut-off at 75 pg/mL) had a sensitivity (95% CI) of 28% (20-36%) and a specificity of 98% (96-100%). IL-10 had a sensitivity of 17% (10-23%) and a specificity of 99% (97-100%).
Retrospective studies of neonates treated with gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin for suspected sepsis were used to identify patient characteristics that affected aminoglycoside PKPD properties. Population PK modelling used NONMEM&#65533; v.5 to determine aminoglycoside clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V). Logistic regression was used to examine the treatment outcome measures (serum peak and trough concentrations and ototoxicity). Simulations of new dosing regimens were undertaken for netilmicin and amikacin using MATLAB&#65533;
The final gentamicin PK covariate model gave CL = 0.097 x (current weight/2)[1.3] x (postnatal age/7)[0.29] and V = 1.07 x (current weight/2)[0.8]+ (confirmed sepsis) x 0.13. A 10% increase in gentamicin V in neonates with sepsis was estimated. For amikacin, 17 (35%) of 49 episodes of confirmed sepsis met the treatment failure criteria from 12 (15%) individual patients. The final amikacin PK covariate model was CL = 0.23 x (current weight/2)[0.691] x (postmenstrual age/40)[3.23] and V = 0.957 x (current weight/2)[0.89]. PD analysis determined risk factors linked to hearing impairment in neonates treated with amikacin included: co-medication with vancomycin, high C-reactive protein concentration and low gestational age. Simulation of a new amikacin dosing regimen recommended: 15 mg/kg 36 hourly, 14 mg/kg 24 hourly, and 15 mg/kg 24 hourly, for neonates [less than or equal to] 28 weeks, 29 to 36 weeks, and [greater than or equal to] 37 postmenstrual age, respectively.
For netilmicin, the final PK covariate model was CL = 0.192 x (current weight/2)[1.35] x (postmenstrual age/40)[1.03], V = 1.5 x (current weight/2)[0.3]. Simulation of a new optimal dosing regimen for netilmicin was: 5 mg/kg 36 hourly, 5 mg/kg 24 hourly, 6 mg/kg 24 hourly, and 7 mg/kg 24 hourly, for neonates [less than or equal to] 27, 28 to 30, 31 to 33, and [greater than or equal to] 34 weeks postmenstrual age, respectively.
IV infusions representing gentamicin administration to neonates of 2.5 kg and 0.5 kg in the NICU setting (30 minutes gentamicin infusion then a 30 minute saline flush) showed the larger neonates received 80% of the drug within 60 minutes. This increased to 90-95% by 75 minutes. However, in extremely low birth weight neonates (0.5 kg), only 60% of the intended gentamicin dose was delivered by 60 minutes (70% by 75 minutes).
In conclusion: IL-12(p70) and IL-10 were identified as promising diagnostic tests to confirm sepsis in neonates. Confirmed sepsis caused a 10% increase in V of gentamicin in neonates, suggesting larger initial dosages (mg/kg) are required for effective treatment of neonates with sepsis. Aminoglycoside clearance in neonates is predominantly affected by current weight, postmenstrual age or postnatal age. Adjusting netilmicin and amikacin doses based on current weight, and dosing interval based on both postmenstrual age and current weight improves drug efficacy. Identification of co-medication with vancomycin, low gestational age, and high C-reactive protein during treatment with amikacin increases risk of hearing impairment. The delivery of gentamicin administrated by IV infusion is substantially extended in extremely low birth weight neonates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aminoglycosides</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">neonatal infections</field><field name="subject">septicemia</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090821.160736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meltwater generation and drainage system development on an Antarctic cold-based glacier</field><field name="creator">MacDonell, Shelley</field><field name="description">Drainage systems on cold-based glaciers are often thought to be simple systems that can be approximated from the supraglacial components of temperate glaciers. Most studies concerning cold-based glacier drainage systems have only considered one facet of the system, with little regard for how the system components interact. Studying each component independently of the whole system constrains our ability to model drainage system function and development. This in turn restricts our potential to predict how drainage systems of cold glaciers may respond to environmental change. The overarching aim of this thesis was to understand drainage system development of a cold-based glacier, and to assess whether our current understanding of supraglacial hydrological systems is consistent with the drainage systems that form on cold-based glaciers. This thesis evaluated the drainage system of the Wright Lower Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, during the 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07 ablation seasons. The study incorporated field, laboratory and numerical analyses, which resulted in a deeper understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of meltwater generation, drainage pathways, water stores and bulk discharge from the glacier. The findings showed that melt variability was driven by sediment and topographic variations, and that water storage in the form of cryoconite holes, intergranular flow, supraglacial ponds and refreezing dictated meltwater transmission to the glacier outlet. These results indicated that the structure, function and variability of the drainage system were inherently more complex than previous studies on supraglacial drainage systems had suggested. These new insights were combined together to construct a new conceptual model of the drainage system structure of a cold-based glacier. However, before the conceptual model can be used to produce a numerical model of drainage system function or development on cold-based glaciers, several issues need to be addressed. These include: refined methods for quantifying meltwater generation in cold, arid environments; methods to measure water storage on and under the glacier surface; further understanding of the development of permeable ice; and a better technique to quantify cryoconite hole connectivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meltwater</field><field name="subject">glaciers</field><field name="subject">subsurface drainage</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090821.162244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Warriors and wanderers : making race in the Tasman world, 1769-1840</field><field name="creator">Standfield, Rachel</field><field name="description">"Warriors and Wanderers: Making Race in the Tasman World, 1769-1840" is an exploration of the development of racial thought in Australia and New Zealand from the period of first contact between British and the respective indigenous peoples to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It analyses four groups of primary documents: the journals and published manuscripts of James Cook's Pacific voyages; An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales by David Collins published in 1798; documents written by and about Samuel Marsden, colonial chaplain in New South Wales and the father of the first mission to New Zealand; and the Reports from the British House of Commons Select Committee into the Treatment of Aborigines in the British Empire from 1835 to 1837. This study employs a transnational methodology and explores the early imperial history of the two countries as a Tasman world of imperial activity. It argues that ideas of human difference and racial thought had important material effects for the indigenous peoples of the region, and were critical to the design of colonial projects and ongoing relationships with both Maori and Aboriginal people, influencing the countries; and their national historiographies, right up to the present day.
Part 1 examines the journals of James Cook's three Pacific voyages, and the ideas about Maori and Aboriginal people which were developed out them. The journals and published books of Cook's Pacific voyages depicted Maori as a warrior race living in hierarchical communities, people who were physically akin to Europeans and keen to interact with the voyagers, and who were understood to change their landscape as well as to defend their land, people who, I argue, were depicted as sovereign owners of their land. In Australia encounter was completely different, characterised by Aboriginal people's strategic use of withdrawal and observation, and British descriptions can be characterised as an ethnology of absence, with skin colour dominating documentation of Aboriginal people in the Endeavour voyage journals. Aboriginal withdrawal from encounter with the British signified to Banks that Aboriginal people had no defensive capability. Assumptions of low population numbers and that Aboriginal people did not change their landscape exacerbated this idea, and culminated in the concept that Aboriginal people were not sovereign owners of their country.
Part 2 examines debates informing the decision to colonise the east coast of Australia through the evidence of Joseph Banks and James Matra to the British Government Committee on Transportation. The idea that Aboriginal people would not resist settlement was a feature not only of this expert evidence but dominated representation of the Sydney Eora community in David Collins's An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, such that Aboriginal attacks on the settlement were not said to be resistance. A report of the kidnapping of two Muriwhenua Maori men by Norfolk Island colonial authorities was also included in Collins Account, relaying to a British audience a Maori view of their own communities while also opening up further British knowledge of the resources New Zealand offered the empire.
The connection with Maori communities facilitated by British kidnapping and subsequent visits by Maori chiefs to New South Wales encouraged the New South Wales colonial chaplain Samuel Marsden to lobby for a New Zealand mission, which was established in 1814, as discussed in Part 3. Marsden was a tireless advocate for Maori civilisation and religious instruction, while he argued that Aboriginal people could not be converted to Christianity. Part 3 explores Marsden's colonial career in the Tasman world, arguing that his divergent actions in the two communities shaped racial thought about the two communities of the two countries. It explores the crucial role of the chaplain's connection to the Australian colony, especially through his significant holdings of land and his relationships with individual Aboriginal children who he raised in his home, to his depiction of Aboriginal people and his assessment of their capacity as human beings.
Evidence from missionary experience in New Zealand was central to the divergent depictions of Tasman world indigenous people in the Buxton Committee Reports produced in 1836 and 1837, which are analysed in Part 4. The Buxton Committee placed their conclusions about Maori and Aboriginal people within the context of British imperial activity around the globe. While the Buxton Committee stressed that all peoples were owners of their land, in the Tasman world evidence suggested that Aboriginal people did not use land in a way that would confer practical ownership rights. And while the Buxton Committee believed that Australia's race relations were a failure of British benevolent imperialism, they did not feel that colonial expansion could, or should be, halted. Evidence from New Zealand stressed that Maori independence was threatened by those seen to be "inappropriate" British imperial agents who came via Australia, reinforcing a discourse of separation between Australia and New Zealand that Marsden had first initiated. While the Buxton Committee had not advocated the negotiation of treaties, the idea that Maori sovereignty was too fragile to be sustained justified the British decision to negotiate a treaty with Maori just three years after the Select Committee delivered its final Report.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">race</field><field name="subject">race identity</field><field name="subject">Maori (New Zealand people)</field><field name="subject">aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">first contact with Europeans</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">To 1840</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090824.145513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models for genetic analysis of polyploid plant species</field><field name="creator">Baldwin, Samantha</field><field name="description">A number of major crop species, such as allohexaploid wheat and autotetraploid potato are polyploid. Potato is the fourth most important crop in terms of production and has become an important food source in many countries. Therefore, the molecular analysis was directed towards investigating ways to develop markers to assist the potato breeding process; for example breeding for powdery scab disease resistance, and tolerance to cold induced sweetening. Polyploids have more possible genotypes per population, allele dosage effects and increased marker complexity compared to diploids. Potato is also outcrossing and therefore highly heterozygous.
Various methods for detecting marker-trait associations including, linkage, quantitative trait locus (QTL) and association mapping were studied and protocols developed. A mapping population was produced and a number of traits were measured including powdery scab resistance. Powdery scab disease assays were carried out over six seasons and markers associated with disease resistance were identified. Markers associated with resistance to powdery scab were identified on chromosomes I, IV, V, VI, VIII and IX using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linkage maps were produced for each parent of the population and QTL associated with resistance and susceptibility to disease were identified using interval mapping, which revealed QTL on chromosomes II, V, VII , VIII, IX and an unanchored linkage group. QTL were detected across years on regions of chromosomes VIII and IX. These QTL results had some overlap with the marker-trait associations that were identified using ANOVA analysis. Another marker identification technique was tested, known as association or linkage disequilibrium mapping. Alleles of candidate genes were tested for association with cold-induced sweetening using a germplasm collection. The alleles identified as important were of the apoplastic invertase and UGPase genes and a unique interaction between alleles of the apoplastic invertase and apoplastic invertase inhibitor was also detected.
This thesis describes the first study into the genetics of powdery scab resistance and the markers identified as associated with resistance will be validated for use in a marker-assisted selection (MAS) programme. The tools and resources developed as part of this thesis are vital to the potato breeding programme that requires the identification of associated molecular markers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polypodiales</field><field name="subject">plant genetics</field><field name="subject">genetic markers</field><field name="subject">biochemical markers</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090826.092431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The causes of nest failure and effects of inbreeding depression in a historically small population of New Zealand Stewart Island robins</field><field name="creator">Laws, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Inbreeding depression is one of the factors that can increase the risk of extinction of small populations, and therefore understanding its effects is currently an important issue in conservation biology. Until recently, few studies on inbreeding depression were carried out in wild populations. These recent studies have highlighted the variability in detecting inbreeding depression among natural populations and the multitude of factors that can influence its expression. Many of the factors affecting inbreeding depression in wild populations remain largely unexplored and most of the recent studies in this area have tended to focus on incidents of inbreeding in populations with a history of large population size.
The aim of this study is to investigate the relative importance inbreeding depression has had on individual fitness parameters in a population of New Zealand's Stewart Island robins Petroica australis rakiura introduced to Ulva Island. This island population has historically gone through several population bottlenecks. Four main factors that potentially influence the rate of inbreeding and the extent of inbreeding depression, were investigated: environmental variability, life history stage, genetic load and dispersal. Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling was first used to determine how weather affected nest survival. Weather effects were then incorporated into models containing demographic factors to control for environmental variability, and finally parental, maternal and paternal inbreeding co-efficients (=f) were added to models to determine the relative importance of inbreeding depression. Interactions between inbreeding depression and environmental factors were explored. Three different life history stages were compared to determine the differences in inbreeding depression at each stage as well as cumulative effects over time. The genetic load of the population was estimated using lethal equivalents allowing for standardised comparison of inbreeding depression with other species. The likelihood of inbreeding in the population was also explored by investigating the factors affecting dispersal patterns and evaluating evidence for inbreeding avoidance.
Inbreeding depression was found to be mild in the robin population. Weather did not have strong effects on nest survival or interactions with inbreeding. Female age was the only factor interacting with inbreeding, with younger inbred females experiencing significantly reduced offspring juvenile survival. Parental and paternal f did not significantly affect brood survival at any life history stage, however, maternal f showed significant effects on nest juvenile survival with the strongest effect occurring when survival was examined cumulatively over all life history stages. The Stewart Island robin had a relatively low lethal equivalent value compared to the closely related North Island robin and other avian species. This difference was associated with the Stewart Island robin having a low genetic load, most likely due to historical genetic purging during periods of population bottleneck. The Ulva Island robin population did not appear to be avoiding inbreeding through dispersal. Dispersal distance was most strongly influenced by the location of the natal nest of the dispersing offspring.
In conclusion, the genetic history of the population was likely to have had the strongest impact on the severity of inbreeding depression in the Ulva Island robin population. The results of the thesis highlight the need to examine a number of factors to be able to explain variability in inbreeding depression among populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand robin</field><field name="subject">Petroica australis rakiura</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">nests</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">effect of environment on</field><field name="subject">rare birds</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">inbreeding</field><field name="subject">bird populations</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island/Rakiura</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090813.114240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth participation with local councils: a snapshot of office reflections involving young people in decision-making</field><field name="creator">Peteru, Paul Seilala</field><field name="description">The study incorporates work carried out by the Auckland Regional Child and Youth Engagement Project (ARCYE). The ARCYE project is part of the Auckland Sustainable Cities, 'Investing in Child and Youth Development' (ICYD) work strand which began in 2003 and was completed in June 2006. The researcher interviewed officers of the seven cities and district councils in the Auckland region and the Auckland Regional Council, all of whom had a child and youth focus within their organisation. The interviews examined the drivers for youth participation from a local government perspective. They shared their experiences in engaging youth to participate in Council sponsored or supported initiatives. The objective was to find out what the benefits of youth participation were for Councils and also for the participating youth. The research supports the proposition that for the Auckland region's economic growth to be sustainable, the next generation of leaders, skilled workers, entrepreneurs, educators and parents must be critically involved in today's discourse concerning the region's development. Therein is the rationale for local government to engage young people. The research posits that the 'whole of government' (central government and local government with community) focus on investing in child and youth development is not random. Rather it is a strategic effort to prepare young people to become responsive to their region's growth and development. The downstream benefits may see engaged youth as a captive audience being open to influence from adults. The value or benefit of including young people in decision-making opportunities therefore needs to be carefully considered within a context of young people's apparent diminished status within society. Youth participation with local councils needs to be real: Young people participating and contributing to the improvement of their communities. As a corollary youth rights within an adult-controlled and managed society requires careful monitoring to minimise the exploitation of young people by adults.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="subject">Auckland Region</field><field name="subject">Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Maori Development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experiences of traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment for threatened preterm labour</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Anneke</field><field name="description">Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity in New Zealand and overseas. Neonatal intensive care is the most expensive item in the national health budget.  The human cost to the child and the family is significant.  In the last twenty five years there has been no reduction in the preterm birth rate despite major advances in neonatal and obstetric care. The aim of this study is to describe and explore the experience of women who had received traditional Chinese acupuncture treatment for threatened preterm labour.  I explore the perception of acupuncture as an effective treatment to stop preterm labour, prolong the pregnancy or prevent preterm birth in a subsequent pregnancy, where risk factors are present.  This is a descriptive and exploratory case study using a multiple case study design.  A purposive sample was selected of five retrospective cases of women who had had a previous preterm birth experience and who had used acupuncture for threatening preterm labour in a subsequent pregnancy.  Data was collected from the women using interviews, observations and review of midwifery and acupuncture case notes.  The data was analysed using content and thematic analysis and also principles based on the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine. The key finding of the study is that the five women at risk all completed a full-term pregnancy. They all noticed that the signs and symptoms usually associated with threatening preterm labour went away when they had acupuncture. They also experienced a number of significant improvements to their general health and wellbeing.  All five were totally happy with the outcomes and the entire acupuncture experience.   When intervention is required, acupuncture based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine appears effective as a treatment strategy in preterm labour.   Few studies have been done in this area.   Further research is needed so that women can be offered choices and healthcare professionals can have confidence in acupuncture as a treatment strategy for threatening preterm labour.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">Labor, Premature</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Health Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experience of severe early onset preeclampsia : a hermeneutic analysis</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Joyce</field><field name="description">Preeclampsia is a complex, baffling and unpredictable syndrome. The condition affects the lives of approximately one in every twenty pregnant women. Most cases are mild but some are serious enough to threaten the life of mother and baby. Medical research has yet to identify a cause, and the search for a cure continues. Delivery remains the only method of resolving this dangerous complication of pregnancy and may need to be effected before the foetus has become mature enough to avoid the risks associated with preterm birth. Women's experience of preeclampsia has received little attention in midwifery and obstetric literature. This hermeneutic phenomenological study has been designed to answer the question "What is women's experience with preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation?" Eight women who had experienced severe preeclampsia were interviewed. Their narratives are analyzed to uncover the meaning of the lived experience of preeclampsia from diagnosis to postpartum recovery. Three data chapters reveal some of the ways that preeclampsia reveals itself as the disease progresses. The findings of this study indicate that there are many atypical presentations of preeclampsia and that sometimes early "showing" goes unrecognized. The woman may in fact feel better as the disease progresses. Late diagnosis leaves the woman and her family shocked and may compromise foetal and maternal safety.  Having preeclampsia changes the reality of pregnancy and early parenting for a woman. Emotional consequences are significant and include an increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. The unpredictable manner in which preeclampsia first "shows itself" is analyzed in the first data chapter and the following two chapters explore the way in which a woman's life may be thrown out of control by diagnosis and management of the disease. Paradoxically, women with severe preeclampsia often lose continuity of care with their midwife at a time when they most need the support of a familiar and trusted professional. Provision of continuity creates a challenge for the midwife when the woman's care is taken over by secondary services. Innovative ideas to enhance the safety and holistic quality of care for women with preeclampsia are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preeclampsia</field><field name="subject">Midwifery</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study on the relationship between identity-checking steps and perceived trustworthiness in online banking system use : submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Information Sciences in Information Technology</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yang</field><field name="description">Online banking systems have become more common and widely used in daily life, bringing huge changes in modern banking transaction activities and giving us a greater opportunity to access the banking system anytime and anywhere. At the same time, however, one of the key challenges that still remain is to fully resolve the security concerns associated with the online banking system. Many clients feel that online banking is not secure enough, and to increase its security levels, many banks simply add more identity-checking steps or put on more security measures to some extent to give users the impression of a secure online banking system. However, this is easier to be said than done, because we believe that more identity-checking steps could compromise the usability of the online banking system, which is an inevitable feature in design of usable and useful online banking systems. Banks can simply enhance their security level with more sophisticated technologies, but this does not seem to guarantee the online banking system is in line with its key usability concern. Therefore, the research question raised in this thesis is to establish the relationships between usability, security and trustworthiness in the online banking system. To demonstrate these relationships, three experiments were carried out using the simulation of an online banking logon procedure to provide a similar online banking experience. Post questionnaires were used to measure the three concepts, i.e. usability, security and trustworthiness. The resulting analyses revealed that simply adding more identity-checking steps in the online banking system did not improve the customers? perceived security and trustworthiness, nor the biometric security technique (i.e., fingerprints) did enhance the subjective ratings on the perceived security and trustworthiness. This showed that the systems designer needs to be aware that the customer?s perception of the online banking system is not the same as that conceived from a technical standpoint.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">online security</field><field name="subject">customer perception</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">online banking</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280101 Information systems organisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The auxiliary replicons of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the Doctorate of Philosophy degree at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yeoman, Carl</field><field name="description">Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus B316T is the most recently described species of the Butyrivibrio / Pseudobutyrivibrio assemblage and now the first to have its genome sequenced. The genome of this organism was found to be spread across four replicons: a 3.5 Mb major chromosome and three additional large replicons: 186, 302 and 361 Kb in size. This thesis describes the sequencing, analysis, annotation and initial characterisation of all three B. proteoclasticus auxiliary replicons. Most significantly, these analyses revealed that the 302-Kb replicon is a second chromosome. This small chromosome, named BPc2, encodes essential systems for the uptake and/or biosynthesis of biotin and nicotinamide adenine mononucleotide, as well as the enzymes required for utilisation of fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration, none of which are found on the main chromosome. In addition, BPc2 contains two complete rRNA operons, a large number of enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, nitrogen and fatty acids. In contrast to BPc2, both megaplasmids appear largely cryptic, collectively encoding 421 genes not previously described in public databases. Nevertheless, only the 186-Kb, but not 361-Kb megaplasmid, could be cured from Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus B316T. The largest megaplasmid has a copy number of 5, while all other replicons are present at a copy number of 1. %GC content and codon usage analyses strongly suggests that all three auxiliary replicons have co-resided with the major chromosome for a significant evolutionary period. Moreover, the replication machineries of these three replicons are conserved. Interestingly, a survey of a number of Butyrivibrio / Pseudobutyrivibrio species revealed that the megaplasmids are widespread in this assemblage, however these other large plasmids do not show concordance with their 16S rRNA phylogeny and appear distinct to those of B. proteoclasticus B316T. A microarray analysis of gene expression in a co-culture experiment between B. proteoclasticus and the important ruminal methanogen, Methanobrevibacter ruminantium M1, revealed a potentially mutualistic interspecies interaction. In this relationship M. ruminantium appears to provide B. proteoclasticus with glutamate, essential to the final step of NAD+ biosynthesis, while B. proteoclasticus appears to provide M. ruminantium with formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, each important substrate for methanogenesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic sequencing</field><field name="subject">replication</field><field name="subject">Butyrivibrio species</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270202 Genome structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Elamite Cylinder Seal Corpus, c.3500 - 1000 BC</field><field name="creator">Roach, Karen Jane</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cylinder seals</field><field name="subject">Elam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary management of low back pain</field><field name="creator">Costa, Leonardo</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low back pain, randomised controlled trials, clinimetrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Serializable Isolation for Snapshot Databases</field><field name="creator">Cahill, Michael James</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">databases</field><field name="subject">transactions</field><field name="subject">concurrency control</field><field name="subject">snapshot isolation</field><field name="subject">serialiazability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ground water monitoring system for effluent irrigated areas : a case study of Hawkesbury water recycling scheme</field><field name="creator">Beveridge, Gavin John</field><field name="description">Water recycling schemes are increasingly being implemented across Australia as an effective means of converting wastewater into a valuable resource. There is currently a lack of specific guidelines for the monitoring of groundwater resources associated with these schemes. This is despite it being widely acknowledged that a monitoring system is a fundamental component of a scheme, due to the risk of altering the hydrogeological processes and resource devaluation. The aim of this research was to address this information gap, by developing guidelines that provide a platform for the continuous improvement in groundwater monitoring systems for recycling schemes. To achieve the stated aim, an action research strategy formed the methodological approach for the implementation of the objectives. Existing guidelines for monitoring systems were reviewed, consolidated and refined, in consultation with industry expertise. The developed guidelines were then verified through the implementation of a case study at the Hawkesbury Water Recycling Scheme (HWRS), with the resulting information providing for a preliminary characterisation of the resources. Designed on current best practice, and to meet statutory requirements, the guidelines addressed the identified information gap. The research recommends the integration of groundwater monitoring systems into the environmental management system for recycling schemes, to provide for continuous refinement through the interpretation of the knowledge base developed in previous cycles. Adoption of this practice will initiate improved decision making and management processes, and provide for future resource protection and enhancement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">water reuse</field><field name="subject">aquifers</field><field name="subject">Hawkesbury Water Recycling Scheme</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/15008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New teachers, professional knowledge and educational reform in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Patrick, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the professional knowledge of new secondary school teachers in New Zealand, their negotiation of multiple discourses encountered in policy and practice, and their processes of professional identity formation. It is also a study of policy reform. In New Zealand, as elsewhere, recent educational and social reforms have brought about major changes to the way education is managed and implemented. These reforms emphasise market ideologies promoting consumer choice and responsibility, while measuring and monitoring quality and effectiveness. At the same time, the reforms attempt to alleviate social inequality. Teachers' negotiation of an accountability culture and the dominant equity policies is a major focus of this study. 
The study draws upon group interviews held with nine new teachers during the first two years of their teaching careers. The group interviews were designed to elicit extended narratives from individual teachers, as well as promote more interactive dialogue and reflections within the groups. Because the interviews were conducted at different points in their early careers, the study also has a longitudinal element, allowing insight into how teachers' views are formed or changed during an intense period of professional learning. Analysis of the teachers' narratives is informed by poststructural and feminist understandings of identity and knowledge and by a methodological orientation to writing as a method of enquiry. 
The thesis develops three main types of discussion and sets of arguments. The first examines new teachers' negotiation of the 'macro' context of teacher knowledge formation that is, their negotiation of an educational policy environment that juxtaposes an equity agenda with accountability controls. In order to historically situate these dilemmas, the particular political, social and educational context of New Zealand is examined. It is argued that teachers negotiate competing political and conceptual debates about social justice, equity and difference, and that this negotiation is central to the formation of professional knowledge. The analysis illustrates ways in which teachers make sense of equity discourses in educational policy and practice, and the apparent contradictions that arise from placing tight accountability standards on schools and teachers to achieve associated equity goals. 
The second type of discussion focuses on teachers' negotiation of the 'micro' dimension of professional knowledge, looking closely at the processes and practices that form professional identity. Against stage or developmental models of teacher identity, it is argued that professional identity is formed in an ongoing, uneven and fluid manner and is socially and discursively situated/embedded. It is further argued that professional knowledge and identity are entwined and that this relationship is most usefully understood through analysis of the discursive practices that frame teachers' working lives and through which teachers work out who they are or should become and what and how they (should) think. This analysis contributes new perspectives to debates in teacher education about teacher preparation and the knowledge required of teachers in current 'new times'. 
The final cluster of arguments brings together these macro and micro aspects of professional knowledge and identity with a case study of how new teachers negotiated a recent educational reform of senior secondary school qualifications in New Zealand. This reform has had a significant impact on secondary schools and on the way teachers, and New Zealanders in general, think about education, achievement and 
success. It was found that this reform significantly challenged new teachers to question their beliefs about assessment and justice in education, and what counts as success. This case study draws attention to the tensions between equity, academic excellence and standards-based assessment, and contributes to understanding how teacher professional knowledge forms both in the context of a specific educational policy reform and in relation to educational reform in general. 
This study contributes new knowledge to the formation of teacher professional knowledge and identity in an educational climate of change in New Zealand. The findings offer new insights for teacher educators, policymakers and schools into how teachers build, shape and sustain professional knowledge; how they juggle contradictions between a desire for justice, policy imperatives and teacher education rhetoric; the self-constructed, but contingent nature of professional knowledge and identity; and the urgency to address identity formation as part of teacher education and to take account of the dynamic ways in which identities form. These matters need to be articulated in teacher education both pre-service and in-service in order to address teacher retention and satisfaction, and teachers' commitment to equity reform in education.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High school teachers</field><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">Vocational qualifications</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20081022.073150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creativity and the Dynamic System of Australian Fiction Writing</field><field name="creator">Paton, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Given the growing interest in fiction writing in Australia, seen in the rise in the number of
festivals, writers' centres, how-to books, biographies and creative writing classes, it is
surprising that very little research has been done within Australia on the nature of literary
creativity itself. A review of international literature on creativity from areas such as the arts,
history, psychology, sociology, cultural studies, business and education shows movement
away from traditional and conventional ideas of creativity that focus primarily on the
individual, towards more contextual approaches that reconceptualise creativity as the result of
a dynamic system at work. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's tripartite model of creativity, which
includes a field of experts, a domain of knowledge and an individual author, has been
successfully applied to the arts and sciences in North America. It is argued that the systems
model is also relevant to Australian fiction writing, a term which is used here to include
novels in literature, popular fiction and genre fiction categories.
This thesis is primarily based on in-depth interviews with 40 published Australian fiction
writers. With over 400 publications between them, the individual writers interviewed
represent a broad cross section of Australian fiction categories at both the national and
international level. In addition to literary writers like Carmel Bird and Venero Armanno, this
sample also incorporates writers in other genres such as Di Morrissey and Nick Earls (popular
fiction), Paul Collins (science fiction and fantasy), Anna Jacobs (romance), Peter Doyle
(crime) and Libby Gleeson and Gary Crew (children's and young adult fiction). Although the
individual writers possess unique combinations of characteristics, biographies and processes,
their collective responses demonstrate common participation in systemic processes of
creativity.
By analysing these responses in terms of Csikszentmihalyi's systems model, this thesis
presents evidence that demonstrates a system of creativity at work in Australian fiction. The
analysis of the collected data provides evidence, firstly, of how writers adopt and master the
domain skills and knowledge needed to be able to write fiction through processes of
socialisation and enculturation. Secondly, it is also the contention of this thesis that the
individual's ability to contribute to the domain depends not only on traditional biological,
personality and motivational influences but also socially and culturally mediated work
practices and processes. Finally, it is asserted that the contribution of a field of experts is also
crucial to creativity occurring in Australian fiction writing. This social organisation,
comprised of all those who can affect the domain, is important not only for its influence on
and acceptance of written works but also for the continuation of the system itself. The
evidence shows that the field supports further writing as well as writing careers with many
authors becoming members of the field themselves.
In sum, the research demonstrates that, rather than being solely the property of individual
authors, creativity in Australian fiction writing results from individuals making choices and
acting within the boundaries of specific social and cultural contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">authorship</field><field name="subject">writing process</field><field name="subject">fiction technique</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090825.125448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian coverage of the Fiji
coups of 1987 and 2000:
sources, practice and representation</field><field name="creator">Mason, Anthony</field><field name="description">For many Australians, Fiji is a place of holidays, coups and rugby. The extent to which we
think about this near-neighbour of ours is governed, for most, by what we learn about Fiji
through the media. In normal circumstances, there is not a lot to learn as Fiji rarely appears
in our media. At times of crisis, such as during the 1987 and 2000 coups in Fiji, there is
saturation coverage. At these times, the potential for generating understanding is great. The
reporting of a crisis can encapsulate all the social, political and economic issues which are a
cause or outcome of an event like a coup, elucidating for media consumers the culture, the
history and the social forces involved. In particular, the kinds of sources used and the kinds
of organisations these sources represent, the kinds of themes presented in the reporting, and
the way the journalists go about their work, can have a significant bearing on how an event
like a coup is represented. The reporting of the Fiji coups presented the opportunity to
examine these factors. As such, the aim of this thesis is to understand the role of the media
in building relationships between developed and developing post-colonial nations like
Australia and Fiji.
A content analysis of 419 articles published in three leading broadsheet newspapers, The
Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian and The Canberra Times, examined the basic
characteristics of the articles, with a particular focus on the sources used in these articles.
This analysis revealed that the reports were dominated by elite sources, particularly
representatives of governments, with a high proportion of Australian sources who provided
information from Australia. While alternative sources did appear, they were limited in
number. Women, Indian Fijians and representatives of non-government organisations were
rarely used as sources. There were some variations between the articles from 1987 and those
from 2000, primarily an increase in Indian Fijian sources, but overall the profile of the
sources were similar.
A thematic analysis of the same articles identified and examined the three most prevalent
themes in the coverage. These indicated important aspects of the way the coups were
represented: the way Fiji was represented, the way Australia's responses were represented,
and the way the coup leaders were represented. This analysis found that the way in which
the coups were represented reflected the nature of the relationship between Australia and
Fiji. In 1987, the unexpected nature of the coup meant there was a struggle to re-define how
Fiji should be understood. In 2000, Australia's increased focus on Fiji and the Pacific region
was demonstrated by reports which represented the situation as more complex and uncertain,
demanding more varied responses.
A series of interviews with journalists who travelled to Fiji to cover the coups revealed that
the working conditions for Australian media varied greatly between 1987 and 2000. The
situational factors, particularly those which limited their work, had an impact on the
journalists' ability to access specific kinds of sources and, ultimately, the kinds of themes
which appeared in the stories. The variation between 1987 and 2000 demonstrated that
under different conditions, journalists were able to access a more diverse range of sources
and present more sophisticated perspectives of the coup.
In a cross-cultural situation such as this, the impact of reporting dominated by elite sources
is felt not just in the country being covered, but also in the country where the reporting
appears. It presents a limited representation, which marginalises and downplays the often
complex social, cultural and historical factors which contribute to an event like a coup.
Debate and alternative ways of understanding are limited and the chance to engage more
deeply with a place like Fiji is, by and large, lost.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coups d'etat</field><field name="subject">foreign correspondents</field><field name="subject">news</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">20th century</field><field name="subject">21st century</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090826.144012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He tataitanga ahua toi : the house that Riwai built, a continuum of M&#257;ori art</field><field name="creator">Jahnke, Robert Hans George</field><field name="description">Prior to the 1950s, visual culture within tribal environments could be separated into customary and non-customary. In the early 19th century, customary visual culture maintained visual correspondence with prior painted and carved models of the pre-contact period. In the latter part of the 19th century, non-customary painted and carved imagery inspired by European naturalism informed tribal visual culture. This accommodation of European imagery and practice was trans-cultural in its translation to tribal environments. In the 1960s, an innovative trans-customary art form evolved outside tribal environments, fusing customary visual culture and modernism. This trans-customary art form, which maintained visual empathy with customary form of the 19th century, was introduced into the tribal environment, initially, in a painted mural in 1973, and subsequently in a multimedia mural in 1975. In 1989 and 1990, this trans-customary Maori art practice informed the art of the Taharora Project at Mihikoinga marae in Ohineakai. In this Project, the 1970s transcustomary Maori art precedents were extended with non-customary form and practice. The thesis employs tataitanga kaupapa toi as a paradigm for Maori cultural relativity and relevance en-framing form, content and genealogy. Annexed to this paradigm are a range of methods: a tataitanga reo method for interpreting Maori language texts; a tataitanga korero method, conjoining a kaupapa Maori and an iconographic approach, for interpreting meaning in tribal visual culture, and a tataitanga whakairo method, incorporating stylistic analysis as formal sequence, semiology and intrinsic perception, for analysing a continuum of stylistic development from the Rawheoro School of carving to the Taharora Project. The Taharora Project constitutes the case study where tribal visual culture and contemporary art within tribal environments are contextualised in a trans-cultural continuum. The critical question that underpins this thesis is how do form, content and genealogy contribute to art that resonates with Maori? The thesis concludes that trans-cultural practice in contemporary art can resonate with Maori if the art maintains visual correspondence or visual empathy with customary tribal form. In their absence, cultural resonance can be achieved through a grounding of the content, informing the art, in a paradigm of Maori cultural relativity and relevance, a tataitanga kaupapa toi. The genealogy of the artist is a further determinant for resonance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori art</field><field name="subject">Maori wood-carving</field><field name="subject">Whakairo</field><field name="subject">Whare whakairo</field><field name="subject">K&#333;rero nehe</field><field name="subject">Mahi toi</field><field name="subject">Maori sculpture</field><field name="subject">Maori painting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410299 Visual arts and crafts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/984</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile agent security</field><field name="creator">Alfalayleh, Mousa</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">security</field><field name="subject">mobile agent</field><field name="subject">disclosure risk</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exceptional teachers: a case study that emphasises dispositions when differentiating between teachers</field><field name="creator">Faull, Glenda Adelle</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exceptional teachers</field><field name="subject">teacher dispositions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/38325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhizoremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil using Australian native grasses</field><field name="creator">Gaskin, Sharyn</field><field name="description">The breakdown of contaminants in soil resulting from microbial activity that is enhanced in the presence of the plant root zone, rhizosphere, has been termed rhizoremediation. To date, Australian native plants have not been assessed for their hydrocarbon rhizoremediation potential. The use of native plants offers an economically feasible and environmentally sustainable cleanup option for the rehabilitation and restoration of hydrocarbon contaminated sites in Australia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of Australian native grass species for the rhizoremediation of aliphatic hydrocarbon contaminated soil from a mine site. 
Candidate Australian native grass species Poaceae were selected following the development of essential and desirable growth criteria. Nine perennial Australian grasses were evaluated for seedling emergence in sandy loam soil sourced from a mine site which was artificially contaminated with a 60:40 diesel/oil mix at concentrations of 30 000 mg/kg, 10 000 mg/kg, 5 000 mg/kg and 0 mg/kg control. Seedling emergence was not adversely affected by the presence of hydrocarbon contamination at the exposed concentrations for eight of the nine species studied p &gt; 0.05. Three promising species were assessed for relative growth performance in diesel/oil contaminated 10 000 mg/kg, 5 000 mg/kg and uncontaminated control soils in greenhouse studies to assess their tolerance of aliphatic hydrocarbon contaminated soil. 
Cymbopogon ambiguus Lemon Scented grass is a summer growing perennial with widespread distribution throughout Australia including the region where the mine site is situated. Brachiaria decumbens Signal grass &#150; naturalised - is adapted to humid tropical areas of Australia and is native to the site and sourced from seed banks. Microlaena stipoides Weeping grass var. Griffin is a cool season grass, widely distributed throughout Australia in moister regions. The three evaluated species survived for 120 days in the diesel/oil contaminated soil at the exposed concentrations without adverse growth affect p &gt; 0.05. In some instances e.g. C. ambiguus growth stimulation occurred in the presence of contamination producing significantly more root biomass compared with the control p &lt; 0.0001. 
Most hydrocarbon degradation is believed to occur through microbial processes, and so the plant-associated microbial community was examined in the three tolerant species. The assessment of the influence of grass on the abundance and activity of microorganisms in the rhizosphere revealed species-specific plant-induced changes in the soil microbial community. Selective enrichment of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms was demonstrated in the rhizosphere soil of the Australian grasses tested, to varying degrees. C. ambiguus appeared to have the greatest influence on stimulation of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, followed by the cool season grass M. stipoides. B. decumbens showed consistently lower numbers of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms in rhizosphere soil over time compared to the other two species p &lt; 0.01. The influence of grasses on microbial community structure - defined as community DNA fingerprint - in diesel/oil contaminated soil suggested no new microbial population was favoured by the grasses - qualitative shift - rather there were relative quantitative changes in existing members of the microbial population. Soil lipase activity did not appear to be an optimal bioindicator of rhizoremediation and may encompass total soil microbial activity not exclusively the hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms of interest.
The assessment of biodegradation of hydrocarbons in soil is essential to characterise the effectiveness of plant species in rhizoremediation. Residual diesel and oil concentrations as total petroleum hydrocarbons, TPH were measured using Gas Chromatography. The presence of single species successfully enhanced the removal of hydrocarbons from soil for all species. All showed significantly lower residual hydrocarbon concentrations than those in unplanted soil after 100 days p &lt; 0.01. Significantly, it was not necessary to add N and P to achieve up to 90% reduction in hydrocarbon concentrations in the soil. The relative performance of each grass species varied. In soil planted with C. ambiguus hydrocarbon concentrations were reduced faster and to a greater extent than the other species studied, from 10 000 mg/kg to approximately 1 100 mg/kg TPH, 88% removal. Similar endpoint success was recorded for M. stipoides which facilitated 80% reduction in hydrocarbon concentrations. Interestingly,    B. decumbens, the only naturalised species, did not perform as well as the other species, although still significantly better compared to unplanted controls, with hydrocarbon concentrations reduced to approximately 4 500 mg/kg, 49%. Hydrocarbon concentrations in unplanted control soil were reduced by 45% through natural biodegradation processes. Plant root and shoot tissue was periodically assessed for hydrocarbon accumulation and was shown to be negligible. A multispecies planted trial using C. ambiguus plus B. decumbens had no additional influence on total TPH removal. The final TPH removal efficiency in the multispecies trial was not significantly different p &gt; 0.05 from that of the best single species performer of the two i.e. C. ambiguus. In a field application the planting of multiple species may still be desirable in order to preserve site biodiversity and assist rehabilitation of the area.
A strong relationship between abundance of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms in the rhizosphere and hydrocarbon biodegradation was demonstrated for all species p &lt; 0.01. Those species which showed greatest stimulation of the microbial population resulted in enhanced TPH removal from soil. These species were the summer grass C. ambiguus and the winter species M. stipoides. This may allow for broader application both seasonally and geographically across Australia. B. decumbens showed successful rhizoremediation to a lesser degree, but may still be an option in multiple planting strategies.   
This investigation identified three Australian grass species from the nine evaluated that are candidates for further investigation for in situ rhizoremediation potential at field scale.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Health</field><field name="subject">diesel</field><field name="subject">phytoremediation</field><field name="subject">mine site</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">native grass</field><field name="subject">lipase</field><field name="subject">MPN.</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090820.111303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latitudinal patterns in reef fish assemblage structure : the influence of long-term and short-term processes</field><field name="creator">Delacy, Caine Robert</field><field name="description">Latitudinal patterns in reef fish assemblages reflect the influence of long-term environmental conditions, evolutionary processes and the recent, short-term influence of fishing. Long-term processes generate the typically common latitudinal patterns in reef fish assemblages, such as decreases in diversity and herbivory towards higher latitudes. These patterns reflect the global gradient in water temperature and the isolation of temperate regions from the tropics. Fishing also influences reef fish assemblages in that it decreases the abundance of large-bodied carnivore species on reefs, often leading to over-exploitation, depletion and in some cases the extirpation of populations. Indirectly, the removal of these large-bodied carnivores can influence the abundance of their prey, leading to an increase in non-target species. This study examines the latitudinal patterns in reef fish assemblages across a unique biogeographic region, the temperate Western Australian coast, and incorporates an investigation of the influence of fishing on the structure of these assemblages. Seven regions across seven degrees of latitude and seven degrees of longitude covering approximately 1500 km of coastline were sampled. Fish assemblages were characterised at each region using diver operated stereo-video transects. At each region, four locations, and within each location, four reefs were surveyed totalling 1344 transects. A significant gradient in water temperature exists with latitude and longitude. Along the Western Australian coast, and in contrast to other regions species diversity of reef fish increased towards higher latitudes and there was no evidence for a decrease in the biomass and abundance of herbivorous reef fish. The presence of the poleward flowing warm water Leeuwin current combined with the absence of major extinction events means the temperate Western Australian coast contrasts with global latitudinal trends in reef fish assemblage structure. The unique biogeographic history of temperate Western Australia has also generated a high degree of endemism among reef fish. Nearly 30 % of the species found along the west coast in this study are endemic to Western Australia, with the narrow range of these species playing an important role in the large scale patterns and spatial vi heterogeneity in reef fish assemblage structure. Furthermore, many of these endemic species are large-bodied carnivores and targeted by fishers. The impact of fishing on the abundance of large-bodied carnivores throughout the Western Australian temperate region is clear both spatially and temporally. The distribution of fishing effort is greatest along the west coast and decreases towards the south following the gradient in SST. Along the west coast, high levels of fishing effort have reduced the biomass and abundance of target carnivores to well below the standing biomass of the south coast where a low level of fishing effort occurs. This reduction in biomass is related to the historical declines in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of many key target species. These target species include endemic species such as Choerodon rubescens, Glaucosoma herbraicum, Epinephilides armatus Nemadactylus valenciennesi and Achoerodus gouldii.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fish populations -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Fisheries -- Catch effort -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Fishery management -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Reef ecology -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Reef fishes -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Reef fish assemblages</field><field name="subject">Biogeography of reef fish</field><field name="subject">Effects of fishing</field><field name="subject">Reef fish demography</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mateship and Money-Making: Shearing in Twentieth Century Australia</field><field name="creator">O'Malley, Timothy Rory</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">shearing</field><field name="subject">labour history</field><field name="subject">Australian Workers Union</field><field name="subject">Pastoral Workers Industrial Union</field><field name="subject">Grazcos</field><field name="subject">Graziers Association of NSW</field><field name="subject">National Farmers Federation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community indicators: development, monitoring and reporting</field><field name="creator">Alexander, J. R.</field><field name="description">The New Zealand Government is striving to improve the way it measures progress and plans for change in an integrated &#8216;whole of government&#8217; manner. The Local Government Act 2002 serves to strengthen participatory democracy and community governance. Under the Act, local authorities are charged with monitoring, and, not less than once every three years, reporting on the progress made by the community in achieving its outcomes for the district or region. These outcomes belong to the community and encompass what the community considers important to progress towards. Indicators that measure economic, social, environmental, cultural and democratic progress at local level are a primary tool that local authorities use to measure the progress towards their desired outcomes. To successfully track progress, it is important that indicators are technically sound and reflect the values of the entire community. The monitoring of indicators is expected to be ongoing and participatory.  The New Zealand Government has leant heavily towards a decentralised locally driven approach to community indicators. The purpose of this study was to explore the manner in which different local authorities have undertaken community indicator: development, monitoring and reporting. This was undertaken through a two pronged approach: 1). A scoping exercise assessing the contents of eighteen local authority LTCCPs, 2). In-depth case studies of community indicator programmes of five of the eighteen local authorities.  It was found that the approaches used to develop, monitor and report community indicators ranged abruptly across local authorities. Some councils appear to have relatively robust and meaningful indicator processes in place, which are both technically sound and have gained representative community input. In contrast, other councils hold a compliance mentality towards community indicators and have done the bare minimum when designing their indicator frameworks. These frameworks have tended to be council dominated with few opportunities for community involvement. In addition to this, local authorities poorly communicated indicators through their LTCCPs. The inadequate information detailing indicators processes is unlikely to both educate and promote community buy-in. Councils must place greater emphasis on the engagement of the entire community including other governmental departments, to ensure that indicators are relevant and meaningful for all. Consistency across local authority indicator frameworks will also help to ensure that all local authorities are working in an integrated manner towards the common goal of improving community well-being. Initiatives such as the Linked indicators Project and the Quality of Life Project are possible methods of ensuring consistent indicator frameworks.  Finally, councils must provide greater information about community indicators within their LTCCPs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community wellbeing</field><field name="subject">community outcomes</field><field name="subject">community governance</field><field name="subject">community participation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Local Government Act 2002</field><field name="subject">local authorities</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">indicators</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulphur nutrition of the grass component on a tussock grassland soil</field><field name="creator">Vartha, E.

Field trials were established at Mt Somers, Mid Canterbury. This study attempts to elucidate some of the factors connected with the sulphur nutrition of grasses. For the particular trial area it was hoped to determine four key aspects ; 1. Whether the response of the grass to nitrogen is governed by the sulphur level available. 2.  A determination of what level of nitrogen was likely to be provided by clover fixation and transferred to the grass component under improved grassland conditions in the area. 3. What the optimum level of sulphur for the association is, allowing adequate sulphur for maximum possible nitrogen fixation as well as for utilization by the grass of the nitrogen transferred. 4. The effects of nitrogen and sulphur on plant chemical composition and any possible relationships between plant and soil as infuenced by these factors.

This potentially dangerous activity is regulated by post translational modification and peptidase inhibitors. The best characterized of the peptidase inhibitors are the serpins whilst the aspartic peptidase inhibitors are the least characterized. Aspartic peptidase inhibitors are rare with only nine known sources. However, they are of great interest because they play an important part in several human diseases such as metastasis of breast cancer cells, Candida albicans infections and HIV. The aims of this research project were to investigate the structure of Squash Aspartic peptidase inhibitor (SQAPI), using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). This required large amounts of relatively pure and isotopically labeled protein, which was achieved by heterologously expressing His-tagged rSQAPI fusion protein in Escherichia coli using a rich to minimal media transfer method. The fusion protein was purified with a nickel column and the N-terminal extension containing the His6-tag was removed by cleavage of the fusion protein with enterokinase followed by nickel column purification. Preliminary 1 dimensional NMR spectra indicated that SQAPI was folded in solution at pH 3. This was confirmed from the results of a preliminary 15N-edited HSQC. These results combined justified the production of a 15N 13C labeled SQAPI sample for the collection of further NMR spectra. From the spectra produced with double labeled protein the backbone and the side-chain atoms of SQAPI were assigned. The chemical shifts are currently 88.89% complete and have been submitted to the biological magnetic resonance bank (BMRB). A preliminary estimate of the secondary structure of SQAPI has been calculated from the HNHA spectrum suggesting that the SQAPI structure has some similarity to the previously proposed model of the inhibitor&#8217;s structure. Furthermore, the region corresponding to the putative binding loop on the model of SQAPI was found to be mobile and deuterium exchange experiments indicate that the SQAPI structure is more globular than open.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peptidase inhibitors</field><field name="subject">SQAPI gene phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270108 Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Approaches to the Delivery of XML and Schemas</field><field name="creator">Davis, Stephen James</field><field name="description">Typically XML documents are delivered as whole documents, and the transmission does not consider if all of this data may actually be relevant to the user. This results in inefficiencies in terms of both bandwidth (transferring unnecessary data) and computing resources (extra memory and processing to handle the entire XML document). Through exploitation of XML's tree-like structure, a simple and lightweight protocol is introduced (referred to as RXPP). Designed with mobile devices in mind, RXPP provides users with the ability to navigate and retrieve data from remote documents on a node-by-node or branch-by-branch basis, allowing users to retrieve only fragments of interest. By skipping unwanted XML nodes, this avoids the need to always maintain a full copy of the XML document locally as processing of the document is performed remotely. When only partial views of XML documents are maintained, the processing requirements of mobile devices are less demanding and requires less memory. Furthermore, time and money can be saved when using mobile devices in bandwidth limited environments where data is often charged per kilobyte as only the relevant data is retrieved when the user selects the next node or branch. Through extension of RXPP, a two-way exchange of XML documents is introduced called RXEP. RXEP allows users to receive XML fragments and also update remote XML documents. In addition to the navigation features of RXPP, RXEP further allows users to construct queries (e.g., using the XPath language), requesting many XML nodes from a remote XML document. In some cases, users can construct well crafted queries to retrieve all the relevant XML fragments using only a single request. RXEP locators are introduced which extend the path features of XPath to the provide precise location of received XML fragments within the clients own local version. RXEP locators provide extra information such as the nodes absolute location and total number of sibling nodes. RXEP locators thus allow clients to retrieve fragments of XML whilst replicating the exact structure of the original XML document. Through exploitation of RXEP locators and RXEP's two-way exchange, office suites using XML as a document format (such as MS Office and Openoffice), becomes an ideal target for collaborative editing amongst many users. This allows users to download only relevant parts of a document and upload corrections or modifications without the need to upload the entire document. To further increase the efficiency of RXEP, a binarised (i.e., compressed) version of the protocol is explored. By utilising well established tree-based binarisation techniques significant savings can be achieved through compression of the RXEP structure and requested XML data. A new technique called SDOM is introduced which merges the structural information from XML Schemas with the requested XML document. SDOM allows users to request XML fragments using RXEP techniques where the requested XML data can be compressed on-the-fly using the information contained within SDOM. BinRXEP thus allows users to perform queries or navigation on remote XML documents and receive the results in a compact and compressed form. In many cases, the overhead added by RXEP, is reduced to less than a byte when using binRXEP. Techniques for the transmission of both XML and XML Schema fragments within a single RXEP packet are proposed. Utilising RXEP, a user can request fragments with a of XML data from a remote document with a further option to request the XML Schema fragment required for validation of that fragment. In this way, the user can avoid retrieving all XML Schemas associated with an XML document, and may only retrieve the relevant XML Schema fragments. Finally, the collaborative creation of XML Schemas is introduced. Utilising RXEP XML and Schema techniques, users can all contribute to the creation of a schema in realtime, while seeing the progress of other users. This collaborative creation of schemas can lead to quicker creation of XML Schemas. Users may then extend the current set of descriptors or generate new descriptors using ideas from the previous schema updates, thus resulting in a richer set of descriptors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthony Mannix: 'The atomic book'</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Gareth Sion</field><field name="description">This thesis is the first and only investigation, academic or otherwise, of the oeuvre of the internationally recognised Australian Outsider Artist Anthony Mannix (1953- ). Virtually unknown as a writer, it is this aspect of his practice that will be the focus of this thesis. The central argument of this thesis is that, whilst Mannix&#8217;s writing displays the extreme level of idiosyncratic thinking commonly associated with the work of Outsider Artists, it retains many traces of the literary, artistic and social environment in which he lives. Such traces are defamiliarised by his experience of schizophrenia and the episodes of psychosis that provide much of the subject matter for his texts. Rational language is refigured by madness in what Mannix calls his &#8220;outsider writing&#8221;. It is argued that such writing presents a dialogue between madness and reason, resisting the propensity (as elucidated by Michel Foucault) of rationality to silence the voice of the insane. Mannix cites the work of Antonin Artaud as influential on his own ideas. This thesis contextualises Mannix&#8217;s point of view in relation to theorists (predominantly post-structuralist and &#8220;anti-psychiatric&#8221;) for whom Artaud was also influential in defining notions of madness. 	Chapter One discusses the construction of &#8216;The Mannix Atomic Book Digital Archive&#8217; (&#8216;The Atomic Book&#8217;), to which this thesis is designed as companion. The archive has been created to facilitate the detailed study of Mannix&#8217;s writing; almost entirely unpublished, such work is predominantly held in singular volumes unavailable to the public. Thus, it is to the archive itself that many of the Mannix quotations discussed by this thesis are referenced. The archive contains digital versions of seventy-two artists&#8217; books (numbering in excess of four thousand pages), sound recordings, a video work and biographical material. Chapters Two and Three discuss Mannix&#8217;s engagement with the central theme of his work, madness. Chapter Two examines the influence of schizophrenia, and particularly psychosis, on Mannix&#8217;s artistic world-view. Here he consciously situates himself within the lineage of Art Brut and Outsider Art as a shamanic figure documenting his own personal unconscious &#8220;cosmology&#8221;.  	Chapter Three discusses Mannix&#8217;s dialogue with psychiatry. Mannix&#8217;s oeuvre, what he terms his &#8220;book of life&#8221;, can be read as a &#8220;speculative narrative&#8221; which counters the rational narratives with which psychiatry has attempted (in over twenty years of contact) to re/write him in a manoeuvre that sees the medical profession characterise the patient as an unreliable narrator of their own experience.	Chapter Four is focused on the second dominant theme within Mannix&#8217;s work: the erotic. Mannix&#8217;s psychotic episodes are often highly erotic in nature and the unconscious landscapes Mannix explores are dominated by erotic happenings and images. It is often through the erotic that Mannix experiences the subject / object confluence characteristic of schizophrenia, and the manner in which art-making facilitates such erotic unions is outlined.	The final two chapters of the thesis, Five and Six, rather than drawing from many works simultaneously, are dedicated to a close engagement with a selection of individual books and creative series produced by Mannix. Here it is the manner in which texts operate as narratives in their own right that is the focus of analysis. Chapter Five discusses the following texts: The Machines, or a Concise History of the Machine (as far as I know them&#8230;)&#8230;.; Erogeny: a book of fables about Rozelle Lunatic Asylum, The Skull, The Chambers and The Demise.	Chapter Six focuses on what Mannix calls his novel, The Light Bulb Eaters. It is within this, his longest written work, that Mannix suggests he most comprehensively sets out his unconscious cosmology. Mannix details his &#8220;schizophrenic trek&#8221;, a journey into the underworld of the unconscious in pursuit of the &#8220;power&#8221; required to take control of the very landscapes through which he moves.  Ultimately, Mannix seeks release from this death-like realm; in order to achieve such a resurrection he must, literally, bring his artwork to life and this becomes the definitive aim of his entire oeuvre.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design for conceptual knowledge processing: case studies in applied formal concept analysis</field><field name="creator">Ducrou, Jon</field><field name="description">Conceptual Knowledge Processing (CKP) is a knowledge management and data analysis technique that makes use of conceptual structures. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a CKP methodology that uses lattice theory to represent units of thought, or concepts. When FCA is used in software applications, it makes use of a process called Mixed Initiative. Mixed Initiative breaks down the roles of user and machine, allowing each to play to their strengths. This process allows the computer, which can process vast amounts of data, to produce interaction options from which the user can select. A human can interpret semantic knowledge contained within the data that a computer cannot. This synergy of user and computer allows complex tasks to be performed. Wille [Wil99] proposed ten atomic tasks of CKP which are combined to make these more complex tasks. The ten tasks are exploration, search, recognition, identification, analysis, investigation, decision, improvement, restructuring and memorisation. Individually, these tasks represent facets of interaction with conceptual systems. This thesis uses the ten tasks of Conceptual Knowledge Processing as a framework for experimentation with applications that use Formal Concept Analysis. The applications used for this analysis are MailSleuth, SurfMachine, DSift, ImageSleuth and SearchSleuth. These applications approach various problems, using FCA as the primary knowledge structure and interaction framework. Each application uses various interface components and varying degrees and types of exposure to the FCA structures on which they are based. The connection between CKP tasks and interface exposure is then explored and reported.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting private data in information systems</field><field name="creator">Kong, Yibing</field><field name="description">The use of private data is ubiquitous. On one hand, people submit their private data to obtain services. On the other hand, organizations need private data to carry out their business. Characterized by convenience, efficiency and cost-saving, information systems are useful for private data management. As a result, vast amounts of private data are collected and processed electronically. However, inadequate protection may end up with the abuse of private data. Privacy concerns affect people&#8217;s attitude towards providing their private data, which restricts the success of organizations&#8217; business. The importance of privacy control is well recognized today. Privacy control should be regarded as an imperative design criterion for information systems [40].The common ground between privacy and security allows us to develop privacy protection techniques based on existing security protection techniques. In the past decade, a few studies have been conducted in this area. Nevertheless, they give individuals limited control over their private data. In particular, after an individual submits his/her private data to an organization, he/she almost loses control over it. This thesis considers this lack of control as a potential problem in information systems. Based on existing security protection techniques, three privacy protection approaches are proposed: an access control based approach, a hierarchical encryption based approach and a digital ticket based approach. These approaches are highlighted for their consideration for information donors&#8217; privacy preferences.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local futures traders and behavioural biases: evidence from Australia</field><field name="creator">Grant, Joel</field><field name="description">There is a large growing body of literature in finance highlighting anomalies in the behaviour of individual investors, which violate the axioms of rationality.

This research uses real-world trading data and includes every trade in share price index (SPI) futures contract placed by a local trader at the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) over the sample period 24 July, 1997 - 4 October, 1999. This approach is applied in three separate papers. 'The House Money Effect and Local Traders at the Sydney Futures Exchange', analyses whether professional traders behave in a manner that is consistent with the house money effect or other behavioural phenomenon, in particular loss aversion. Existing work suggests that professional traders exhibit psychological inconsistencies in their trading behaviour (Coval and Shumway, 2005; Locke and Mann, 2004, 2005; Frino et al., 2004). This paper models afternoon risk on morning profit and morning losses, respectively. The results provide strong evidence of the house money effect. In particular, morning profits encourage local traders to increase their risk-taking attitudes in afternoon trading sessions. 'Trading Horizons and Behavioural Biases: Does Time Matter?', analyses whether locals exhibit behaviour biases, such as the house money effect or loss aversion, over various trading horizons. Results reported in previous studies are mixed. Coval and Shumway (2005) find no evidence of abnormal trading behaviour across days, amongst proprietary traders at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), while and Locke and Mann (2004) provide substantial evidence of loss aversion across days, amongst floor traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Results from this research report strong evidence of the house money effect. However, this bias is only evident when locals evaluate their performance at high-frequency time intervals within intraday-trading cycles. 'Professional Futures Traders, Profits and Prices' analyses whether the behavioural biases of local traders affect prices. Work in this particular area is limited. Coval and Shumway (2005) report that proprietary traders at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) behave in a manner that is consistent with loss aversion. Moreover, their results show that this behaviour impacts on short-term prices but has no longer-term impact. This research documents a similar finding, however, morning profits encourage local traders to buy contracts at higher prices and sell contracts at lower prices in the afternoon. This behaviour can be used to explain short-term afternoon price movements of one, two and three units, respectively. Results show that prices revert to earlier levels in the five-minute period following a price-setting trade, negating any permanent price impact.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactive alkaloids from medicinal plants of Bhutan</field><field name="creator">Wangchuk, Phurpa</field><field name="description">Natural products had been indispensably used by many cultures and traditions in folklore medicines for thousands of years. These traditional medicines cater to about 85% of the world population for their primary health care needs. Natural products have been intensively explored also for their bioactive pharmacophores by modern pharmaceutical companies. In fact they are the skeletal framework of about 60% of the modern drugs that are available today. Of these, about 80% of antibacterial drugs and 90% of antimalarial drugs are natural derivatives. One of the interesting secondary metabolite groups which provides these potent drug leads are the alkaloids. Owing to their broad range of bioactivities, bioprospecting for these natural products are undertaken in many countries. In this study, on the molecular basis of traditional medicine of Bhutan, particularly those with potential antimicrobial components, four alkaloid positive medicinal plants, i.e. Aconitum orochryseum Stapf, Corydalis gerdae Fedde, Rununculus brotherusi Freyn and an Australian naturalized plant Tribulus terrestris Linn, but also used in Bhutan, were selected for phytochemical analysis. Bhutanese traditional medicines use Aconitum orochryseum (whole parts) for the treatment of bilious fever or high fever related to bile disorders including cold and flu, fever of bile (liver), fever caused by malaria, snake bites and for treating blood infections. Corydalis gerdae (whole parts) is used for the treatment of malaria and infections. Ranunculus brotherusi (aerial parts) is used for treating wounds, pus, infections and as antipyretics. Tribulus terrestris (fruit) is used for the treatment of arthritis, kidney diseases and as a diuretic. Though Tribulus terrestris and Ranunculus brotherusi failed to give any alkaloids, a number of new as well as known alkaloids were isolated from Aconitum orochryseum and Corydalis gerdae. Three new hetisane type diterpenoid alkaloids named orochrine, 2-O-acetylorochrine, and lingshinaline, together with two known alkaloids atisinium chloride and virescenine and six other unidentified alkaloids, were isolated from Aconitum orochryseum. The structures of the new alkaloids were elucidated by (superscript 1)H-NMR, gCOSY, gNOESY, TOCSY, (superscript 13)C-NMR, DEPT, gHSQC and gHMBC spectral data analysis. Atisinium chloride, a major alkaloid of the plant, was identified by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Four known protopine type and protoberberine type isoquinoline alkaloids (protopine, scoulerine, cheilanthifoline, and stylopine) along with one unidentified alkaloid were isolated from Corydalis gerdae. The protopine was the major alkaloid of this plant. The alkaloids were identified by MS and (superscript 1)H-NMR spectral data comparison. The antibacterial testing of crude methanol extracts, crude alkaloids and the major alkaloids (atisinium chloride, orochrine and protopine) of these two plants were found inactive against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = greater than 125 ?g/ml) and Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (MIC = greater than 125 ?g/ml). But the in vitro antimalarial assay of crude methanol extracts, crude alkaloids, atisinium chloride, protopine, and cheilanthifoline gave very significant activity against Plasmodium falciparum, TM4 and K1 strains. Crude methanol extract (AO-ME) of Aconitum orochryseum was not that active (IC(subscript 50) of greater than10 ?g/ml for both the strains). Increased activity was observed for its crude alkaloid (AO-CEA) with IC(subscript 50) values of 20.40 ?g/ml against TM4 and 19.20 ?g/ml against K1 strains. The activity was further increased for atisinium chloride with IC(subscript 50) values of 4.02 ?M against TM4/8.2 and 3.59 ?M against K1CB1 strains. The antimalarial activity was better for the extracts and alkaloids of Corydalis gerdae. Its crude methanol extract (CG-ME) had the IC(subscript 50) values of 1.00 ?g/ml against TM4 strain and 2.56 ?g/ml against K1 strain. The activity of crude alkaloid of this plant was far better with IC(subscript 50) values of 0.33 ?g/ml against TM4 strain and 0.63 ?g/ml against K1 strain. Protopine had IC(subscript 50) values of 4.25 ?M against TM4/8.2 and 4.29 ?M against K1CB1 strains. Cheilanthifoline had the IC(subscript 50) values of 3.76 ?M against K1 and 2.78 ?M against TM4 strains. These alkaloids have the potential to become candidates for antimalarial leads. Similar activities may be expected from other alkaloids including new ones isolated from these two plants. Therefore, the combination of these two plant extracts would make the best antimalarial herbal mixture for Bhutanese traditional medicines. The results proved that ethno-directed biorational approach, combined with an alkaloid focus, is an efficient strategy for drug lead discovery. The results also proved for the first time at the molecular level that Bhutanese traditional medicines have clinical efficacy. The medicinal plants of Bhutan thus have potential to provide important new drug leads. Bioprospecting them would benefit local people, pharmaceutical industries and the patients at large.

A key to addressing this issue has been to identify the determinants that may influence an adolescent's decision to be physically active. A determinant that has been hypothesised is the level of proficiency of the motor skills used to participate in physical activity; however, this relationship has been virtually unexplored. This study investigated how organised sports and games, nonorganised physical activity, and cardiorespiratory endurance were each related to fundamental motor skill ability among adolescents. One thousand and seventy-two and 954 adolescents from Year 8 and Year 10, respectively, participated as subjects in this study. Organised sports and games and nonorganised physical activity were assessed by a self-report recall questionnaire of participation in physical activity. Cardiorespiratory endurance was measured by performance on the Multistage Fitness Test. Fundamental motor skill ability was qualitatively assessed by performance on a six-item fundamental motor skills test battery. Descriptive statistics plus multiple regression were used to analyse the data. Results suggested that participation in organised sports and games was significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability, F (4, 1831) = 14.30, p less than .0001, and that this relationship was stronger for males than for females. Participation in nonorganised physical activity was not significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability. Cardiorespiratory endurance was significantly related to fundamental motor skill ability, F (4, 1808) = 79.05, p less than .0001. For adolescents, fundamental motor skill ability may be an important variable influencing participation in organised sports and games and cardiorespiratory endurance and development of motor skills may increase adherence to a physically active lifestyle during adolescence which may carry over to adulthood.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vehicle dynamics modeling</field><field name="creator">Vyas, Satyen</field><field name="description">Aim of this research was to develop a computer based mathematical model of motor vehicle dynamics. Mainly the tire, suspension and chassis behaviour have been modelled in detail. Other components like engine and drive train are modeled in a very simplified manner. The model provides steer, throttle and brake controls as the means to drive the vehicle. Driving instructions can be given manually one at a time, or they can all be listed in a file as a driver program, which the model will follow to drive the vehicle. The model is implemented using MATLAB programming environment. It simulates vehicle behaviour by doing calculations in small time steps of &#57517;t seconds. Typical values of &#57517;t are 5 to10 milliseconds. It produces a large results matrix, containing values of many variables. These values are used to generate various plots and analyze the vehicle behaviour. The program is also capable of generating track geometries and plot vehicle travel path on it.Results of the model are tested against the test data obtained from the University of Wollongong FSAE race car. The testing confirmed that the overall accuracy of the results is well within acceptable limits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intention-driven textual semantic analysis</field><field name="creator">Li, Jie</field><field name="description">The explosion of World Wide Web has brought endless amount of information within our reach.

Attributional responses that teachers construct result in differing teacher affect, evaluative feedback and expectation of future performance. Once these understandings and expectations are embedded they are less likely to change over the span of a teaching career. This study therefore examined preservice teachers&#8217; attributional responses to boys with a learning disability who had failed a class test. Preservice teachers&#8217; attitudes towards students with learning disabilities, and their teacher efficacy were also explored in relation to their attributional responses. The instructional strategies that preservice teachers report they would use for students with learning disabilities were also considered.Six hundred-sixty-seven preservice primary and secondary school teachers within New South Wales were studied across four University Campuses. Five kinds of instruments were administered to the subjects of the study: a demographic questionnaire, an attributional vignettes questionnaire, an attitudes questionnaire, a teacher efficacy scale questionnaire, and, an instructional strategies questionnaire. Each University within New South Wales is required, by the Department of Education and Training (DET), to include a compulsory inclusive education subject within their course design. To investigate the influence that the compulsory inclusive education subject has on preservice teachers, the study included preservice teachers who had and had not completed the subject.The results of the study showed that preservice teachers form a negative attribution cycle about students with a learning disability, which is in stark contrast to the positive attribution cycle that they form about students without a learning disability. The findings show that preservice teachers view students with a learning disability more from a medical model viewpoint that emphasises deficits. Thus, they are generally more positive towards students with a learning disability, less frustrated, more sympathetic, and have lower expectations of their future performances. Philosophically, their educational view towards students with a learning disability is driven by ability, rather than effort, which is in contrast to their view towards students without a learning disability. Preservice teachers also report they would use more teacher-centred instructional strategies for students with learning disabilities, in comparison to using higher cognitive level instructional strategies in a student-centred environment for students without a learning disability. The application of teacher efficacy to this study suggested that preservice teachers who believed, and were confident in their own teaching abilities, were more likely to have a greater academic focus on classroom instructional strategies and outcomes. Similarly, preservice teachers with a greater positive attitude towards students with a learning disability had higher expectations of these students and reported greater use of higher cognitive level instructional strategies in a student-centred environment.Finally, the study suggests recommendations and implications for practice and future research in regards to understandings and expectations of students with learning disabilities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding social relevance: young people, wellbeing and regulated support</field><field name="creator">Laverty, Judith</field><field name="description">In this thesis I draw on data from semi-structured interviews with eleven young people living in economically disadvantaged circumstances in Sydney, Australia to explore how these young people make a life and negotiate the discourses that operate to support and regulate them. Drawing on Foucault&#8217;s (1991) discussion of &#8220;governmentality&#8221; I develop a new analytical matrix (the matrix of regulated citizenship) to map the relationships between neo-liberal notions of individual responsible citizenship, institutional discourses of support and young people&#8217;s self practices. Through this mapping I describe the regulatory impacts of neo-liberal and institutional discourses on young people&#8217;s lives and demonstrate how forms of compliance become normalised and/or are contested through people&#8217;s self making. The matrix reflects the operation and interconnections between neo-liberal and institutional discourses of governance. It provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding young people&#8217;s lives and priorities beyond discussion of transition and risk, while also making available a new analytical tool for use in youth research.Through my analysis I draw attention to the multiple ways that young people negotiate and construct notions of possibility and wellbeing within the context of ongoing structural constraint and increasing individualisation. In particular, I identify the critical interconnections for young people in the study between forms of self determination, social connection and finding &#8220;relevance&#8221; or a place where you feel you fit. It provides insights into how young people are represented and representing themselves within a neo-liberal society and the regulated context of support.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalisation of the curriculum in higher education through study abroad and global learning</field><field name="creator">Bell, Maureen</field><field name="description">Internationalisation of the curriculum is a major issue for academics, administrators and policy makers in an era of market-driven changes affecting the higher education sector. It is a key program strategy within the wider activity of internationalisation of higher education. The latter is increasingly seen by policy makers and university administrators as driven by international student mobility and the need for revenue from international student fees. These are critical issues for universities in the globally competitive market environment.Despite its importance as a concept, it is not yet clear just what internationalisation of the curriculum means, or how it should be implemented. Thus it attracts a variety of perspectives and understandings. For example, it could be described simultaneously as a systemic reaction to the neo-liberal economic imperatives of marketisation and as an educational response to globalisation. One important outcome of the work described herein is the development of recommendations for internationalisation of the curriculum to assist and empower academics in providing international learning outcomes for their students.The literature review carried out as part of this study revealed that only a relatively small amount of research, evaluation and guidance on internationalisation of the curriculum has been published. It was also clear that very little is known about the ways in which academics and students experience internationalisation of the curriculum.The research reported herein was designed to fill this gap by documenting and analysing the staff and student experience. The research is therefore grounded in the interpretive paradigm and utilises case study method. Using the curricular areas of the Best Practice Guidelines for Internationalising the Curriculum (Whalley, 1997) as a framework, two summer study abroad programs and one global learning course at Australian and Singaporean universities were chosen for study. These programs were offered within science faculties however the curriculum for the study abroad programs included languages and commerce subjects. After data gathering the Presage, Process and Product structure of the 3P Model of Learning (Biggs, 2003) was used as an interpretive tool.The cross-case analysis surfaces common themes and highlights contradictions and tensions that were seen to lead to problems in practice. In particular, the two study abroad programs were found to be top-down and failed to offer students an authentic international learning opportunity. In contrast, the third case, a global learning course, was found to be both top-down and education-led and afforded a level of international engagement for students.Academic goodwill was found to be the most critical factor for success of internationalisation of the curriculum initiatives. Other factors that were found to have negative impacts include: the absence of theoretical frameworks underpinning internationalisation of the curriculum and curriculum planning; the non-alignment of assessment policy and practice across partner institutions; and the failure to develop student learning communities.From the themes identified in the cross case analysis a set of recommendations for internationalisation of the curriculum is offered by the author to help academics and administrators develop policy and a disciplinary vision for courses and programs that lead to international outcomes for students. These recommendations refer to the need for: theory-based, education-led models and disciplinary visions for internationalising the curriculum; equity of student access; student engagement within and across institutions; local and transnational student learning communities; policy-based procedures and professional development and support for academics.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Busy doing nothing: researching the phenomenon of "quiet time" in a challenge-based wilderness therapy program</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, Valerie E</field><field name="description">Wilderness therapy programs are increasingly regarded as an effective alternative to more traditional forms of therapy for people identified as  &#8216;at risk&#8217; or &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; (Gass, 1993). Despite substantial evidence to support the use of wilderness and adventure experiences to promote attitudinal and behavioural change, much remains unknown about the process of change and the experiences of participants. The purpose of the research was to generate a grounded theory about participants&#8217; experiences of Quiet Time within a challenge-based wilderness therapy program. The central question to be addressed was: What is the phenomenon of Quiet Time from the participants&#8217; point of view and how do they use this phenomenon in a challenge-based wilderness therapy program?  A grounded theory design (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998) was chosen as a methodology to guide the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Sixteen male and two female participants from four Mountain Challenge wilderness therapy programs scheduled between February 2002 and February 2005 participated in the study. All but one of the participants came to the Mountain Challenge as part of ongoing therapy for drug and/or alcohol addiction. This triggered significant and particular ethical concerns that impacted on the design of the study. The exception was a female trainee facilitator who participated as all other participants and had no facilitative responsibilities.  Data were collected in the form of interviews, photographs, journals, field notes and standard program documentation. An analytical framework using inductive and deductive categories was selected to analyse the data.Based on the findings a theoretical model of the phenomenon of Quiet Time was deduced and a number of propositions for practice and research advanced. The research findings identify Quiet Time as a &#8216;sense&#8217; of solitude that, contrary to understandings of solitude as an objective and external condition, is defined by the four co-occurring subjective and internal conditions: a sense of being alone; a positive mind frame; a personal time perspective and focussed attention. Further analysis led to an understanding that Quiet Time was typically brief, participant initiated, and inclusive of experiences of &#8220;being alone together.&#8221; Participants utilised Quiet Time as an opportunity to focus on nature, reflect, and to engage in authentic and heartfelt conversation. The outcomes of Quiet Time were found to impact positively on participants&#8217; immediate experience and processing of the wilderness therapy program. The study also indicates that the incidence and use of Quiet Time may be facilitated or constrained by a number of conditions including environmental factors, leadership styles, levels of group development and the individual needs, strengths and limitations of the participant. Among a number of outcomes found to extend beyond the duration of the program was, for some, the taking up of a habit of Quiet Time as a deliberate self-help and life enhancing strategy. Unexpected findings included the potential for Quiet Time to arouse feelings that may overwhelm and confuse participants.One of the major contributions of the study is that it identifies Quiet Time as a commonly occurring, and predominately participant initiated phenomenon that has, despite its capacity to impact positively on participants&#8217; attitudes and behaviours, been largely over looked by the wilderness therapy literature. Quiet Time was found to differ from traditional concepts of solitude in wilderness programs in terms of its duration, how it is defined and how it is initiated. Despite its brevity the outcomes of Quiet Time parallel positive outcomes documented elsewhere. The main implication from this research is that the therapeutic potential of challenge-based wilderness therapy programs can be enhanced by promoting the opportunity for participant initiated Quiet Time through the adoption of an unhurried and process oriented approach to the wilderness adventure.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing models to predict the effects of fuel reduction burning on habitat complexity, ground-dwelling mammals and understorey birds</field><field name="creator">Basnett, Gillian</field><field name="description">The variation in vegetation structure is often recognised as one of the main factors attributing to the wide diversity of wildlife supported by Australian Eucalyptus forests. Disturbances that affect the vegetation structure can have repercussions to the animals that rely on certain compositions of plants. Many plants and animals are able to survive under certain disturbance regimes. However, changing the regime can threaten the flora and fauna species within a community. Inappropriate fire regimes are one such threatening process. Yet fuel reduction is a key element of fire management. There is often a conflict between the fire regime needed to keep fuel loads at a level thought to be adequate to assist in managing unplanned fire, and those that would maintain vegetation structure and therefore wildlife diversity. Therefore, in areas where the protection of biodiversity is particularly important there is a need to predict the ecological effects of a fuel reduction burn regime. A number of studies had shown that abundance and distribution of grounddwelling mammals and understorey birds can be estimated from measures of habitat complexity and is has been demonstrated that the effects of fire on these groups can be predicted by changes to vegetation structure. This study uses fuel levels and habitat complexity scores to develop a model to predict the impacts of prescribed burns with different intensities and extents on distribution and abundance of ground-dwelling mammals and understorey birds in 6 different vegetation communities at Coolah Tops National Park, NSW. Within each of the six vegetation communities 25 survey sites were randomly selected. Fuel loads were estimated using litter depth, the dominant plant species were identified and both mammal and bird habitat complexity scores established using revised tables from the literature. The model, devised using the data collected in the field, was used to calculate the change in habitat complexity scores after four different fire scenarios. These modifications were then used to predict the likely affects of the different fire models on ground-dwelling mammals and understorey birds and to produce some implications and recommendations for management. Fire extent had a larger impact on ground-dwelling mammals then fires intensity, with fires that left fewer patches unburnt reducing overall vegetation structure regardless of intensity. Birds however, were predicted to be affected by both intensity and extent, with the greatest impact being seen in the high intensity low patchiness burn models and the lowest impact in the low intensity high patchiness model. The implications for management of this study is that, at least for mammals, fire extent needs to be controlled more then the intensity in order to maintain some refuge areas. Overall, at least temporarily, mammal diversity may be expected to decline by 50-100% and bird diversity by half in the sort of fuel reduction burns that may be applied in a fire management program. Small ground-dwelling mammal abundance is likely to be reduced to zero, while medium to large ground-dwelling mammal abundance is likely to increase dramatically from zero under this fire management program. Understorey bird species likely to be promoted are those able to tolerate open vegetation while those that need dense understoreys will be disadvantaged.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiconductor dosimetry of epithermal neutron beams for Boron neutron capture therapy</field><field name="creator">Carolan, Martin G</field><field name="description">Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a binary targeted therapy that uses suitably designed pharmaceuticals to deliver (superscript 10)B to tumor cells. The region is then irradiated with neutrons and neutron capture by the (superscript 10)B nucleus leads to the emission of an alpha particle and lithium ion. These have very short ranges similar to the dimensions of a biological cell and therefore the technique could have potential for selective killing of tumour cells. In order to achieve adequate neutron fluxes at the site of the tumour epithermal (0.5 eV &#65533; 10s of keV) neutron beams are used. A review of the general details of BNCT is presented in this thesis. This thesis investigates the use of two semiconductor devices for measuring the neutron and gamma dose components involved in epithermal neutron beams used for BNCT. The silicon lattice in PIN diodes undergoes displacement damage when irradiated with neutrons. This leads to a change in the forward bias voltage of the diode that is proportional to the neutron dose received. To verify that the energy dependence of this effect follows the published silicon displacement damage KERMA (Kinetic Energy Released per Mass of Absorber) data measurements were performed using quasi-monoenergetic neutrons obtained from a Van de Graff accelerator (Ansto) in the energy range from 90 keV &#65533; 890 keV. These measurements were in agreement with the published data for silicon displacement damage KERMA. A sensitivity factor for the diodes was also derived from these measurements. The thermal neutron sensitivity of the PIN diodes was then determined using the TC-10 thermal neutron column on the Moata reactor at Ansto. The sensitivity results were in general agreement with the Van de Graff derived sensitivity factor. Since the silicon damage KERMA is not the same as the tissue KERMA function PIN diodes are not intrinsically tissue equivalent. A Monte Carlo (MNCP) ideal beam study was undertaken to see if for some limited energy range tissue dose could be parameterised in terms of silicon damage dose and foil activation. This was found to be approximately true for neutron energies from thermal to 100 keV. Coefficients are given that allow tissue dose to be determined on the basis of a single PIN diode and activation foil measurement in spectra where the maximum neutron energy is 100 keV or less. MOSFETS can be used as gamma radiation dosimeters by measuring the change in threshold voltage (simplistically understood as the potential applied to the gate to initiate current flow from source to drain electrodes) that occurs when they are exposed to radiation. The MOSFETs used in this study were characterised using a Varian 2100C medical linac beam and low energy x-rays from a superficial x-ray unit. The sensitivity of the MOSFETs was measured with different potentials applied to the gate during irradiation. Depth dose profiles in 6 MV x-ray beams were measured and found to be in good agreement with both ionisation chamber measurements and MCNP simulations. This good agreement was also obtained for the buildup region. Although the silicon oxide layer of the MOSFET is not intrinsically very sensitive to neutron irradiation the presence of encapsulating materials leads to the generation of secondary photons and electrons which lead to shifts in threshold voltage and therefore confound gamma ray measurements in mixed neutron / gamma fields. To determine the energy dependant neutron response function of the MOSFET a detailed MCNP simulation was used. A lithiated shield was also incorporated into this model. The calculated neutron response functions were used to correct for neutron contributions to MOSFET measurements in mixed fields. MOSFET thermal neutron responses were measured using a series of measurements with MOSFETS both with and without lithiated covers exposed in the the Moata thermal neutron column at Ansto. The measurements were repeated with various gate potentials. The gamma doses measured were consistent with gamma doses measured using paired ionisation chambers. The Petten HB11 facility is briefly described as are phantoms and MCNP models fabricated by S Wallace for an associated work. Measurements using PIN diodes and MOSFETs in phantoms exposed in the HB11 beam are described. Foil activation data is compared to MCNP calculations to validate the MCNP models used. This thesis presents a number of results that have been recalculated in more detail and with various parameters changed. In particular the effect of variations in phantom hydration have been incorporated as have response functions for MOSFET detectors and associated shields. PIN diode measurements in a Perspex cube phantom exposed in the HB11 beam show good agreement with MCNP calculated silicon displacement dose. Similarly good agreement is obtained for a cylindrical phantom filled with tissue equivalent gel when the hydrogen content of the gel in the original model is corrected for dehydration. Measurements in a more complex skull phantom show larger discrepancies between the experimental results and a MCNP simulation especially at depth. The discrepancies range from 25 &#65533; 300% in absolute terms but are only 2-3% of the maximum silicon dose. MOSFET measurements performed in the Perspex cube phantom using lithiated covers show excellent agreement with ionisation chamber measurements (also with lithiated covers). Measurements in a cylinder phantom and head phantom using lithium/perpex covered MOSFETs are compared with Monte Carlo calculations of induced gamma dose. In this case the measured gamma doses at approximately 2 cm depth appear to be too low. Further investigation involving a detailed MCNP simulation including the lithiated MOSFET covers in the model indicated that the covers suppress the thermal neutron flux at the measurement point and therefore the gamma dose is also reduced. Measurements at greater depths show a similar effect but to a lesser extent. The epithermal neutron beam at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor (BMRR) is described is described. PIN diode and MOSFET measurement results in a Perspex cube phantom are also presented. Reasonable agreement between calculated and measured PIN diode results is observed. MOSFET measurements show good agreement with the known percentage depth dose curve for the total gamma dose. However there is a discrepancy in the absolute magnitude of the measured gamma doses. It is proposed that this is also due to thermal neutron flux depression arising from the use of relatively thick lithiated neutron shields around the MOSFETS. In summary; It is demonstrated that PIN diodes could be useful for verifying treatment planning dose distributions in epithermal neutron beams. This includes the possibility of on line real-time measurements. They could also be used in conjunction with an activation foil to yield tissue equivalent dose measurements where the maximum neutron energy is less than 100 keV. Lithium shielded MOSFET measurements can be reconciled with calculated gamma dose distributions when the effect of flux depression is taken into account. However the perturbations introduced by the shield mean that the measured dose does not represent the dose at the measurement point in the absence of the shield. In order to use MOSFETs for gamma dosimetry in epithermal neutron beams different encapsulation is required to minimise neutron response and eliminate the need for lithiated covers. It is suggested that MCNP simulations of MOSFETs similar to the models in this thesis would provide an adequate tool for optimising the appropriate encapsulation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interviewer-administered, open-ended diet history method for assessing usual dietary intakes in clinical research: relative and criterion validation studies</field><field name="creator">Martin, Gina S</field><field name="description">In this thesis three studies are reported, which aim to investigate the performance of an interviewer-administered, open-ended diet history for the use in clinical studies where dietary variables are manipulated. The studies presented here are focused on validating self-reported macronutrient and energy intakes in Australian adults who have volunteered to participate in dietary intervention research. The evaluations are performed using food records, 24-hour recalls and biochemical markers of intake for comparison. In addition, a pilot study is presented, which examines the ability of hair and sebaceous lipid composition to reflect dietary fatty acid intake in healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are the highest form of evidence for examining both the treatment and prevention of disease by dietary nutrients. Given this, it is imperative that these nutrients are measured as accurately as possible to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding their capabilities. Despite the importance of data from clinical trials, the literature relating to the performance of dietary assessment methods in this context is sparse. Despite evidence to show that food records and 24-hour recalls are not always able to measure intake accurately, many dietary intervention trials are using these methods to measure dietary intake during the intervention period. Since the diet history method is used in clinical practice, albeit in a less rigorous manner, and the clinical trial is, in essence, a highly controlled form of clinical practice, examination of the diet history method in this research context is warranted. The first study in this thesis examined the validity of an interviewer-administered, open-ended, non-structured diet history in adults with Type II diabetes mellitus. The trial examined the viability of a high monounsaturated fat diet for the treatment of associated blood and insulin abnormalities. The dietary data were obtained retrospectively and the diet history was examined relative to a 3-day food record using a number of statistical techniques. The results showed that the diet history method was able to measure both energy and macronutrient intakes reasonably well at both the group level and the individual level. There was, however, a failure to measure the fatty acid composition of the diet, which was due to a few outliers who reported discrepant values. Nethertheless, the relationship between paired data for these variables was significant once outliers were removed. There was no relationship between bias and intake indicating that systematic error was not operating in this group. An important finding from this study was the large proportion of individuals underreporting energy intake. This was not method-specific, but rather subject-specific and tended to occur in the larger individuals, however the use of a nutrient density model diluted in the effects of underreporting for comparisons of the diet history with the food record. The non-structured diet history method was found to estimate energy and nutrient intakes relatively well in a clinical population with Type II diabetes. The second study also used retrospective data from both the former study and another clinical trial, which examined the effects of a high monounsaturated fat diet on the prevention of diabetes in Australian adults with mild insulin resistance. The aim of this study was the compare the performance of the interviewer-administered, non-structured diet history between healthy individuals and individual with Type II diabetes mellitus undergoing similar intervention protocols with differing intensity. The results showed that the values measured by the DH in the healthy individuals were closer to those of the food record than in the individuals with Type II diabetes. Moreover, the degree of underreporting in the healthy individuals was significantly lower than in individuals with diabetes. Biases in the measurements of target nutrients also showed movement in different directions between the two sample groups. The third study was designed to fit within the research protocol of a dietary supplementation trials, which examined the effects of fish oil and soy isoflavone on the risk profile for cardiovascular disease. The study presented in this thesis aimed to assess the validity and reproducibility of a diet history method using both food records and multiple 24 hour recalls for reference, in addition to urine nitrogen and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition as biomarkers of dietary intake. The biochemical markers not only provided information as to the performance of diet history method, but also the reference methods to determine if discrepancies between paired data were indeed due to diet history failings. The diet history method used in this study was slightly different to the aforementioned non-structured approach with the record of foods taking place on a structured meal-based form with food prompts for the dietitian. The allowed the dietitian to prompt for the context of eating as well as the foods consumed. Since the concern in this study was the accuracy of the data for a valid trial outcome, prompting was not considered to introduce bias, but rather to improve memory of foods consumed. The results showed that the diet history method was measuring higher absolute intakes of energy and macronutrients than both the food records and the 24-hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake of energy and macronutirents than both the food record and the 24 hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake during the course of the intervention indicating that the reference methods were prone to underestimation. The diet history values also moved in line with those of the food record and the 24-hour recall. In addition, the diet history was shown to be better at estimating long chain fatty acid intake than the food record for variables, which were of importance in a fish oil supplementation trial. Nevertheless, this study showed that the structured diet history method was both valid and reproducible for estimating macronutrient and energy intake in a sample of Australian adults participating in a dietary supplementation trial. The final study was designed in response to the lack of biomarkers available for fat intake. This study was pilot study, which aimed to investigate if the fatty acid composition of both hair and sebaceous secretions was related to the fatty acid composition of the diet. If a relationship was shown then a potential non-invasive method for assessing what may be a single or a few fatty acids in the usual diet was possible. The results showed that there were no significant relationships between hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition and corresponding dietary fatty acids due, in part, to large numbers of undetectable fatty acids in the different tissues, which prevented correlation. Future research will indicate if hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition is valuable for assessing changes in dietary fat. As a result of the studies presented in this thesis, the interviewer-administered, structured diet history method has been used in numerous studies to date conducted through the author&#65533;s institution and requests for its use continue as clinical dietitians conduct research within their own institutions. If anything, this thesis has shown that relative validation of dietary methods is valuable and should be done in context. The issues that affect persons participating in trials with large subject burdens are not the same for those who undertake just a validation study. The methods used in intervention trials needs to be validated within the context of the trial and its participants. However, objective markers should always be used as an adjunct to any validation study especially those that inform on absolute nutrient intake such as urine nitrogen. This thesis reports on a number of interesting limitations associated with measuring dietary intake in free-living individuals especially in larger individuals in the sample group. A number of interesting macronutrient-specific biases are also reported on in this work. Further research in dietary methodology should focus on the need for contextual validation of dietary methods since the administration environment affects the accuracy of the test method. In addition, clinical trails, which are dependent on nutrient targets for outcome, should make validation studies a priority and should question the accuracy of the reference methods used for validation purposes. This thesis has shown that the diet history interview is a valuable method for measuring dietary intake in clinical trials in free-living individuals. Of importance, is the contextual aspect of administration where the diet history would need to be validated in specific research environments, however, the studies presented here provide insight into the performance of the diet history method in clinical research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cultural history of cinema-going in the Illawarra (1900-1950)</field><field name="creator">Huggett, Nancy</field><field name="description">This thesis explores a cultural history of cinema-going in the Illawarra region of New South Wales over the first half of the twentieth century through oral history interviews with cinema-goers of the period. The research was originally intended to explore the Australian cinema industry from a regional perspective. However, while the interviews contained fascinating details and stories of cinema-going in this period, they did not fit seamlessly into existing academic discussions about cinema which often focus on film texts and national cinema industries. Therefore, as well as considering how the oral histories I collected contributed to pre-existing academic discourses about the cinema industry and national screen content, I have also explored other discourses that are articulated in audience narratives. Through exploring the debates in cultural studies about audience research and the work of the Popular Memory Group and other critical oral historians, I critically evaluate the oral history narratives as well as the methodology of oral history itself. I look at the intersection of oral history practice with cultural studies in order to highlight issues of representation and power and to celebrate the way that differences between written and oral histories can foreground processes of meaning-making. My contention in this thesis is that cinema-going is a strategy of mediation through which people make sense of themselves, their lives and their relationships with others. I test this theory by considering cinema-going in relation to a series of identifications: national identity, local identity, personal identity and political identity (age being one strategic location from which older individuals can draw on age-related discourses and experiences to achieve particular narrative ends). In conclusion I argue that any cultural history of cinema-going is a mediated history which is constructed within a matrix of meaning-making strategies. It is created through audience members&#65533; narratives of cinema-going which re-configure memories in accordance with particular discourses of significance either in the narrated past or in the narrating present. The researcher, who tells the story with reference to specific research priorities and current academic discourses, further mediates such a history. Therefore, as well as setting out a cultural history of cinema-going in the Illawarra for debate and further research, the emphasis on mediation is intended to encourage reflection on the creation of history as a complex, collaborative and political process which creates one story as it silences others.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do the characteristics of high support accommodation predict the needs of mental health consumers?</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Adele</field><field name="description">Objective The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between key accommodation and support characteristics and the needs of mental health consumers in high support accommodation. The second aim was to ascertain whether consumers in these settings had levels of need and functioning commensurate with the high levels of support being provided. Method A sample of consumers accessing high support, very high support and residential rehabilitation services (as defined by NSW Health, 2002) were identified. Interviews were conducted using the Camberwell Assessment of Need to assess consumer perceptions of need and satisfaction with the type and amount of help received. Staff ratings of functioning were collected using the Life Skills Profile&#65533;16. Thirteen characteristics of the accommodation acknowledged in published research as being preferred by consumers were identified: (a) Service is no further than 1km away from transport; (b) service is no further than 1km away from community facilities; (c) the service does not own the property in which consumers reside; (d) the service separates the management of the property (e.g. rent collection, maintenance etc.) from the provision of support; (e) each consumer signs a separate lease; (f) consumers are not required to adhere to service-specific house rules; (g) consumers are not required to move out of their accommodation when their needs change; (h) one and two bedroom facilities are available; (i) consumers are offered a choice of housing options on application; (j) each consumer has their own bedroom; (k) staff are not based at the accommodation; (l) staff are not present 24 hours a day; and (m) support is available on an outreach basis. The relationship between these characteristics and consumer perceptions of need and satisfaction were explored. Comparisons were also made between services providing 24-hour staff support and those less intensively staffed. Results One hundred and sixty-five consumers from 26 services across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory were interviewed. Seventy-five percent of the sample was male and the mean age was 43 years. Consumers had on average 7.6 needs of which 2.1 were unmet. Of the thirteen consumer preferred characteristics identified, only on-site staffing, property ownership, signing a lease and 24-hour staffing predicted the number of needs identified by consumers. There were six characteristics which predicted the types of needs consumers expressed with the availability of 1 and 2 bedroom accommodation featuring in models which predicted need in the health, basic and service CAN sub-domains. Consumers of 24-hour services had a significantly shorter length of stay and more unmet needs than consumers of less intensively staffed services. They were also significantly less satisfied with the amount of help they received than consumers without this level of support. Needs in the basic and services sub-domains differentiated consumers of 24-hour services from those receiving less staff support. Consumers with a high level of need did not have a correspondingly low level of functioning and consumers residing in services with 24-hour staffing had significantly higher levels of functioning. Conclusions Results did not support the hypothesis that consumers of services implementing higher numbers of consumer preferred characteristics have fewer unmet needs and higher levels of satisfaction. Whilst increasing the availability of consumer preferred models of accommodation remains a priority, this may not lead to a reduction in need and associated reduction in the intensity of service required. However, the identification of specific areas of need could lead to better targeted service provision. The fact that consumers of very high support services have almost the same number of needs as consumers of high support services raises questions about the screening processes used by services to assess the suitability of referrals and the availability of less intensively staffed accommodation for consumers whose needs for care reduce.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of cohesive soil-granular filter interaction incorporating critical hydraulic gradient and clogging</field><field name="creator">Biswas, Sharbaree</field><field name="description">Granular filters are used in embankment dams to prevent core materials from internal erosion, while draining seepage water to prevent saturation of the downstream embankment. Current filter design criteria based on particle size ratios are not valid for cohesive soils, which provide significant resistance to erosion due to cohesion. Relying on this, filters are designed for many dams using coarse gravels with pore sizes in the range of 5-10 mm. Performances of dams in field condition are reported satisfactory except when very large sizes gravels are used, leading to insufficient compaction of clay with gravel and the likely problem of reduced particle contact. The problem of 'crack' is identified in the impervious core. Generally this type of cracking has not been a consideration at the design stage and thus subsequent failures are detected. To mitigate this, filter gradations are reduced to pore sizes between 0.3-5 mm. The erosion of soils and performance of filters or dam structure in general all depend on the actual field condition existing in the core: intact or cracked. In the case of intact core, soil erosion is insignificant and filter gradations are much wider, however, those perform successfully. Where a crack develops in the core, the seepage pressure is large, erosion is significant (the eroded particles are in the range of 10 microns), and filter gradations are narrow. The proposed analytical models reveal that the critical hydraulic gradient is a key indicator in designing filters for cohesive dam cores. For a particular soil in an intact core, the required critical hydraulic gradient for destabilization of soil particles is significantly high (around 1000) and thus filter gradations are wider. In a cracked core, however, the seepage condition can be quite severe, the critical hydraulic gradient is comparatively small (around 100), and the required filter gradations are thus narrower. The predicted results are verified by experimental modeling and also by comparing them with the results of previously proposed models. Experimental investigations have been carried out using compacted clay with a central pinhole representing a crack. Both the analytical and experimental results show that the effective cohesion (C) in intact core and the critical shear stress (Tc) in cracked core are the key governing factors respectively in evaluating the critical hydraulic gradient. Filter properties, such as pore sizes, also have a significant influence. In addition, the critical hydraulic gradient varies with effective stresses due to the weight of overlying layers. When filter pores are small, there is potential for the filters to become clogged, since porosity and subsequent permeability are too low. Clogging is a specific characteristic of interface of base and filters where filter pores are blocked by eroded base particles. This leads to improper drainage, which is responsible for high pore pressures in the core thus promoting failure of the dam. Another aspect of this thesis is to investigate clogging in granular filters due to the flow of clay slurry generated from crack walls. According to laboratory tests, clogged filters are identified based on the gradual decrease in flowrate and permeability over 5 hours of testing period, without attaining a constant value. The experimental results indicate that the uniformity coefficient, porosity and subsequent permeability of filters are the main factors in evaluating clogging.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on nitrogen cycling processes in Lake Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Qu, Wenchuan</field><field name="description">Lake Illawarra is a typical shallow intertidal barrier lagoon in south-eastern Australia. The lake is considered as strongly nitrogen limited, and eutrophication is the key environmental problem as a consequence of an expansion of catchment development with associated increases in urban, rural and industrial pollution in recent decades. The aim of this study was to investigate the internal biogeochemical nitrogen cycling processes and the interactions with the carbon cycling processes in Lake Illawarra, in order to a improve the understanding of the system and to increase the overall knowledge base on nutrient biogeochemical cycling in coastal water bodies.Firstly, nutrient budgets for Lake Illawarra were updated using the LOICZ modeling approach based on the most recent and reliable water quality data available. This indicated the biogeochemical functioning of the estuary and assisted in understanding the dominant natural biogeochemical processes within the system. The LOICZ budget classified the lake as generally a heterotrophic environment, producing carbon through net respiration. The budget results also indicated that the lake was a net sink for nitrogen, a net denitrifying system and was nitrogen limited.Benthic flux measurements of O2, TCO2, alkalinity, NH4+, NO3 -+NO2 - and N2 were then made using the sediment-core incubation technique at selected stations to compare the characteristics of benthic biogeochemical processes (benthic metabolism, nutrient fluxes and denitrification) for different primary producers (seagrass, microphytobenthos (MPB) and macroalgae) and/or sediment types (sand or mud), and thus to verify the reliability of LOICZ budget approach.The sedimentary organic matter in the macrophyte beds was mainly from seagrasses (Ruppia or Zostera), which was supported by the relatively higher sediment C/N ratios at these sites compared with the adjacent shallow bare sand sites and the deep mud site. On the other hand, the organic matter pool in the unvegetated sites was generally dominated by MPB, which was supported by 1) the lower C/N ratios, 2) the detection of Chl-a, and 3) the microalgae (mainly diatoms) identified in the surface sediments. On an annual basis, seagrass beds exhibited the highest gross primary productivity (O2 or TCO2 fluxes), while the lowest rates occurred in the deep central basin of the lake. Seasonally, there was a general trend of highest production in spring or summer, and lowest production in winter or autumn. Organic carbon oxidation scenarios, evaluated by either calcium carbonate dissolution or sulfate reduction models, indicated that both models can explain organic matter mineralization.Trophic status was evaluated using different indices including BTSI, net O2 fluxes and P/R ratios for Lake Illawarra, which led to similar trophic classifications in general, and also the same trends in spatial and seasonal variation. Overall, these data indicated that the lake was heterotrophic on an annual basis, as the total community carbon respiration exceeded production, and this supported the LOICZ modelling conclusion.In general, nutrient fluxes displayed typical diel variations, with reduced effluxes or enhanced uptake by the sediment in the light, due to the photosynthetic activities of the plant-MPB-sediment community in Lake Illawarra. On an annual basis, unvegetated sediments displayed net DIN effluxes, while seagrass beds showed a net DIN uptake, which may be due to the enhanced denitrification and/or assimilation activity by rooted plants and macroalgae. The effect was most efficient during periods of net growth. Moreover, based on the measured benthic fluxes, N2 flux rates were estimated using C and N stoichiometry, suggesting the lake was a net denitrifying system. LOICZ budget modelling results and the direct denitrification measurements using the isotope pairing and N2/Ar techniques generally support this conclusion.It was found that the benthic metabolism and nitrogen transformation processes in Lake Illawarra were influenced or controlled by physico-chemical and biological variables and their complex interactions, which include light, temperature, water movement or mixing (stirring effect), sediment type (e.g., sand and mud), sedimentary organic matter quality, primary producers (e.g., seagrass, MPB and macroalgae) and infauna (bioturbation).Finally, recommendations for future work have been discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and evaluation of a web-based learning environment for proof-type problem solving in geometry among secondary students</field><field name="creator">Ekanayake, Madduma Bandara</field><field name="description">The major purpose of this study was to address the instructional needs of proof-type geometry problem solving. It was designed to address two research questions: (Q1). What are the predictive indicators of successful proof-type geometry problem solving? (Q2). Based on needs with an emphasis on formative evaluation, what is one design solution to support students solving proof-type problems in geometry? The overall study focused on a learning need assessment in the first phase of the study (Study 1) and a development process to translate instructional needs identified into a supportive instructional environment for proof-type geometry problem solving in the second phase (Study 2). The review of literature revealed that proof-type geometry problems have different learning requirements compared to other mathematical problems types. The solution process for proof-type geometry problems demands the adoption of a non-algorithmic approach in which students could activate problem-solving strategies that are domain specific. These strategies include heuristics such as using auxiliaries (parallel lines, bisectors and perpendiculars), alternative proving  ethods (indirect proof, reductio ad absurdum, method of contradiction). Equally important are the role of domain-general strategies during the solution of proof-type geometry problems such as working backward and logical inferencing. The literature review suggested that geometry content knowledge, general processes, and mathematical reasoning could be potential predictive indicators of successful proof-type geometry problem solving. However, the relative importance of these variables during the construction of geometry proofs had not been subjected to an empirical evaluation. Study 1 takes up the above issue by determining the relative importance of these variables in proof type geometry problem solving. Data were collected from 166 Sri Lankan students on three independent variables: Geometry Content Knowledge (GCK), General Problem-Solving processes (GPS) and Mathematical Reasoning Skills (MRS); and a dependent variable Proof-Type Geometry problem-solving (PTG). The relationship among these variables was examined through a multiple linear regression analysis procedure. This analysis showed that geometry content knowledge, general problem-solving processes, and mathematical reasoning are predictive indicators of successful proof-type geometry problem solving. Among these variables, geometry content knowledge was found to be the most influential one followed by general problem-solving processes and mathematical reasoning. Three experts participated in a series of meetings to translate the above findings into a support framework for helping students learn to solve proof-type geometry problems in Study 2. This development process resulted in a conceptual model consisting of three major components: Remedial, Instructional and Problem Solving. The Remedial Component was suggested to address the learning needs related to geometric reasoning development, the Instructional Component focused on the development of content knowledge related to Euclidian deductive system, and the Problem-Solving Component was designed to facilitate proof-type geometry problem-solving skills among students who have the prerequisite geometric content knowledge and reasoning skills. An iterative development process of design, development, review and revision was used to translate the Problem-Solving component into a Web-based, prototype learning environment in Part I of Study 2. This prototype, titled ANGEL (A Non-linear Geometry Environment for Learning), contained problem sets, process guidance, worked examples, diagram support and embedded content knowledge as core structural elements. Hyperlinked metacognitive supports were incorporated to facilitate the problem-solving process through guidance provided by general problem-solving processes such as analysis, representation, planning and use of knowledge retrieval by accessing embedded content. Although technology driven learning environments are mainly for student-technology interactions, ANGEL has additional advantages as it was designed for classroom use with teacher intervention to enhance social interactions: teacher-student and student-student that promote learning and construction. The usability of ANGEL was tested in a constructivist collaborative learning environment. Six students selected from an Australian high school solved a series of proof-type geometry problems in pairs in a two-hour problem-solving session with the help of ANGEL. During their problem-solving attempts, data were collected in the form of student verbalization of the solution process, observation of problem-solving attempts, and written workings in the workbook. Having completed the problem-solving session, the students were interviewed to collect data on how they perceived ANGEL as a learning tool. The qualitative data analysis showed that the target group of students accepted ANGEL as a learning tool and that students enjoyed using ANGEL in problem solving. These patterns of results suggest that ANGEL works as designed and assists students to construct knowledge related to proof-type geometry problem solving.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The thematic development of the magical child in fifteen recent New Zealand novels</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Jennifer M.</field><field name="description">Fifteen New Zealand novels, published between 1983 and 2000, are considered with regard to their representation of the magical child figure. The child is a benign and regenerative figure in the earlier works in this period, with its magical qualities used to heighten its role in a redemptive progression towards the reform of social structures depicted as damaging of cultural and environmental heritage. Later in the period the regenerative possibilities offered by the child diminish, as the relationship between the individual child and adult society diversifies. Where a clear adult/child dichotomy in the early works renders the child as essentially positive and life-giving, the later, more complex field renders the child as less symbolically powerful, more individually threatening and less physically and characteristically distinct from the adult. The novels examined are Keri Hulme&#8217;s the bone people, Patricia Grace&#8217;s Potiki, Cousins and Baby No Eyes, Witi Ihimaera&#8217;s The Whale Rider, The Matriarch and The Dream Swimmer, Rachel McAlpine&#8217;s The Limits of Green, Fiona Farrell&#8217;s The Skinny Louie Book, Elizabeth Knox&#8217;s Treasure, Sue Reidy&#8217;s The Visitation, John Cranna&#8217;s Arena, Anne Kennedy&#8217;s A Boy and His Uncle, Anthony McCarten&#8217;s Spinners and Peter Hawes&#8217;s A Dream of Nikau Jam. The novels are considered within the context of the history of the child character in literature, and particularly of the thematic traditions surrounding child characters throughout twentieth century New Zealand literature. The simultaneous vitality and vulnerability of the child figure, and the transcendent qualities of the magical child, are found to be critical to its construction. These qualities are examined through the Crawford 9 novels&#8217; representations of filiation, nationhood and in the persistent construction of a symbolic relationship between the magical child and various manifestations of a metaphysical void.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chaperone action of &#945;-crystallin</field><field name="creator">Ghahghaei, Arezou</field><field name="description">&#945;-Crystallin is the principal lens protein. It is a member of the small heat shock protein family (sHsp) and acts as a molecular chaperone by stabilizing proteins under stress conditions through the formation of a soluble sHsp target protein complex to prevent their aggregation.Macromolecular crowding is ubiquitous in all types of cells and describes the normal conditions inside a cell. The concentration of macromolecules inside a cell is very high (up to 300 mg/mL) arising from species such as polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids and therefore it greatly promotes the self-assembly of proteins. Thus, there is a major difference between in vivo and in vitro conditions such as those used in most studies of protein behaviour and properties.Appropriate destabilizing conditions (i.e. heating or reduction) cause damage and misfolding of proteins, which as a result expose previously buried hydrophobic regions. Hydrophobic interactions of nearby molecules cause selfassociation and aggregate formation. Aggregation of intermediately folded peptide or protein molecules also leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, highly-ordered &#946;-sheet structures associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#8217;s, Parkinson&#8217;s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases.In vitro, much work has been published on the interactions of &#945;-crystallin with target proteins in dilute solutions. In order to better understand the chaperone activity of &#945;-crystallin under conditions more closely resembling the intracellular environment, its interaction with a range of destabilized proteins (ovotransferrin, &#946;L-crystallin, insulin, &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein) in the presence of dextran (68 kDa) have been examined using visible absorption spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, ANS binding, TEM, HPLC and NMR spectroscopy studies.In the presence of dextran, the rate and extent of aggregation of reduced ovotransferrin, insulin, &#945;-lactalbumin and &#946;L-crystallin was accelerated. Under these conditions, &#945;-crystallin was less effective in preventing aggregation and precipitation of target proteins. It is proposed that a kinetic competition exists between aggregation of target proteins and the chaperone action of &#945;-crystallin which supports the hypothesis that &#945;-crystallin interacts more effectively with slowly aggregating rather than rapidly aggregating target proteins.Amyloid fibril formation by &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein was verified by a sigmoidal increase in Thioflavin T fluorescence over time. &#945;-Crystallin prevented amyloid formation in &#945;s- and &#954;-casein. In the presence of dextran, the rate of amyloid formation by &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein was enhanced. Under these conditions, &#945;-crystallin was less effective in preventing amyloid formation of &#954;-casein and this was supported by TEM, CD, NMR spectroscopy and HPLC studies.Subunit exchange is an important feature of sHsp chaperone action. This study found that subunit exchange of &#945;A-crystallin increased with increasing temperature and decreased as a result of interaction with reduced ovotransferrin. It was further demonstrated that the presence of the dextran markedly reduced the rate of subunit exchange of &#945;A-crystallin and with increasing temperature, this effect was exacerbated. Moreover, in the presence of reduced ovotransferrin, dextran further slowed the subunit exchange of &#945;Acrystallin.Aggregation of &#946;-lactoglobulin occurs mainly via intermolecular disulphide bond exchange. Upon heating, &#946;-lactoglobulin aggregated which increased with increasing pH. The presence of dextran or DTT led to more rapid aggregation and precipitation of &#946;-lactoglobulin. &#945;-Crystallin prevented the aggregation of heat-stressed &#946;-lactoglobulin and was a more efficient chaperone at higher pH values. In the presence of DTT, however, &#945;-crystallin was a less efficient chaperone due to faster aggregation of heated and reduced &#946;-lactoglobulin.In order to obtain further structural and functional information on the C-terminal extension, &#945;-crystallin from dogfish (Squalus acanthias) was studied to allow comparisons with bovine &#945;-crystallin to be made. Chaperone assays under heat and reduction stresses as well as NMR spectroscopy showed that the Cterminal extension of dogfish &#945;-crystallin was very flexible and had a similar structure and function to that of bovine &#945;-crystallin. Its chaperone action under heat stress was found to be comparable to bovine &#945;-crystallin but it was a better chaperone under reduction stress.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emotion style of aggressive-rejected children</field><field name="creator">Bajgar, Catherine Jane</field><field name="description">Prior research suggests that the perceptions and emotions reported by children who are aggressive and are rejected by their peers are incongruent with their social standing and that this aggressive-rejected subgroup often report as though they are not rejected. In contrast to this, the withdrawn-rejected and aggressive-withdrawn-rejected subgroups report relatively high levels of distress and poorer mental health. The aim of the present research was to explore the emotion experiences of the aggressive-rejected subgroup in greater depth and to determine why this subgroup reports so little emotional distress. Three studies were conducted. The first study focused on the development of a measure to assess emotional awareness in children - the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale for Children (LEAS-C). The second study was originally intended to be the main sociometric study of the present research. However, a low participation rate did not allow sufficient numbers to generate rejected subgroups. Study 3 addressed these methodological issues by using passive consent procedures which resulted in a participation rate of 82% (n = 471). Assessment of emotion experience included depression, anxiety, range in positive and negative emotions and anger expression. Processes which may account for low self-reported distress were also explored and included denial and repression, rejection sensitivity and emotional awareness. Emotion experiences and emotion processes were compared between three rejected subgroups - aggressive-rejected, withdrawn-rejected and nonaggressive-nonwithdrawn-rejected and the neglected and average groups. Emotion variables of the rejected subgroups and the neglected group were compared to those reported by the normative average status group. The emotion experiences of the aggressive-rejected subgroup were found to be similar to those reported by the average group. Contrary to expectations, the emotion experiences reported by the withdrawn-rejected subgroup also differed little from the average group. The lack of difference between aggressive-rejected and withdrawn-rejected subgroups raised questions about how distinct the emotion experiences of these two groups were from one another. In general, there was insufficient evidence to support the low-distress hypotheses in aggressive-rejected children. The emotion processes reported by the aggressive-rejected subgroup also did not differ from those reported by other groups. With regard to emotion processes the aggressive-rejected subgroup did not make greater use of denial or repression, levels of rejection sensitivity were not lower and the emotional awareness of the aggressive-rejected subgroup did not differ from the other groups. Posthoc analyses explored whether methodological factors may have contributed to the lack of differences between the aggressive-rejected group and other rejected groups. The procedures to identify subgroups in this study were identical to those used by other researchers in the field. The proportion of children allocated to the rejected subgroups was also similar to those reported elsewhere. However, gender distributions in the aggressive-rejected and withdrawn-rejected subgroups were significantly different and the direction of this imbalance appeared contrary to other studies. Males comprised only 37% of the aggressive-rejected sample but comprised 76% of the withdrawn-rejected group. Contrary to expectations, withdrawn behaviour was found to be more strongly associated with low social acceptance among males while aggressive behaviour was more strongly associated with low social acceptance among females. The extent to which the trend found in this sample reflects sampling differences in Australian and North American cultures is not clear. The gender imbalance between the aggressive-rejected and withdrawn-rejected subgroups and the direction of this imbalance may have had some influence on group differences in the emotion variables. Posthoc analyses also explored the relationship between emotion processes and anger expression within the aggressive-rejected subgroup and average groups. Emotional awareness was found to be significantly related to anger expression in the normal group. In the aggressive-rejected subgroup, anger expression was related to defensive processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/526</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular identification and thermal attributes of forensically important blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae: Chrysomya)</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Leigh Alden</field><field name="description">Forensic entomology applies the study of arthropods associated with carrion, in terms of species succession and development rates, to determine the minimum time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI). Correct species identification is crucial, as the rate of larval development can vary substantially between species. The identification of forensically important blowflies of the genus Chrysomya (Diptera: Calliphoridae) may be hampered by their close morphological similarities, especially as immatures. DNA-based approaches, such as those investigated here, have the capacity to be useful for the identification of forensic entomological evidence in cases where morphological characters are unreliable. In this study, two DNA regions were investigated as potential candidates for the identification of the nine Chrysomya species in Australia: (1) the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and (2) the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) DNA &#8216;barcode&#8217; region. The ITS2 region was assessed by sequence comparison, which identified five restriction enzymes (DraI, BsaXI, BciVI, AseI and HinfI) that were able to differentiate most members of the genus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The closely related species pairs Chrysomya latifrons + Chrysomya semimetallica and Chrysomya incisuralis + Chrysomya rufifacies could not be separated by restriction profile analysis, but the latter could be separated using the size differences resulting from amplification of the entire ITS region. Identical restriction profiles were generated from eight Ch. incisuralis specimens, suggesting low intraspecific ITS2 variation within this species. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 sequence, which is a possible means by which species could be identified, proved successful for the identification of the majority of Chrysomya species. The COI &#8216;barcode&#8217; region resolved all nine Chrysomya species as reciprocally monophyletic, following a neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis of the Kimura twoparameter distances. Mean intraspecific and interspecific sequence divergences were 0.097% and 6.499%, respectively. The hybrid status of one specimen was confirmed Abstract viii following subsequent ITS2 sequence analysis. In another instance, this nuclear region was used to verify four cases of specimen misidentification that had been highlighted by the COI analysis. The COI DNA barcode was successful in identifying Chrysomya species from the east coast of Australia. The ability of the barcode to identify two Chrysomya nigripes specimens from Thailand shows potential for this method to be expanded to other blowfly genera and continents. This result confirmed previous successes with COI as a genetic barcode for species identification and comparisons at the intra- and interspecies levels. Together with correct species identification, thermodevelopment data of blowfly species are vital for the estimation of the PMI. The close morphological and molecular similarities among Chrysomya species led to speculation as to whether members of this genus shared similar developmental profiles. The aim was to establish whether genetically closely related species would share similar developmental profiles. This would permit the application of developmental data to a number of closely related species, including those for which thermodevelopmental studies are lacking. If Australian Chrysomya were found to share developmental profiles, identification of the blowfly specimen to a level beyond genus may not be necessary, or at least it may not be necessary to distinguish morphologically similar sister species. The experimental design employed in this study sets it apart, to date, from other published larval development studies. Nowhere else have the developments of such closely related blowfly species been compared. As the species were collected from the same geographical location, the effects of acclimation and population-level genetic variation were not variables in this study. The experimental conditions in this study were virtually identical, which enabled direct comparisons to be made among the species. This study established that the sister species Ch. megacephala and Ch. saffranea differed significantly in their developmental profiles, as well as compared with the more distantly related Ch. rufifacies. Because of this, genetic distance was not considered to be a useful factor for predicting thermodevelopment profiles of closely related species within a genus, and highlighted the necessity for correct species identification.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater remediation using a coal washery discard permeable reactive wall</field><field name="creator">Gray, Stuart</field><field name="description">Groundwater remediation has become increasingly necessary for environmental sustainability in industrial, agricultural and urban settings. One reason for this need has been the emplacement of rock waste materials (e.g. coal washery discard (CWD) and blast furnace slag (BFS)) from mining and metallurgical industries in areas such as the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Since there has been a lack of rigorous research into the potential for these emplacements to pollute groundwater, the majority of these emplacements were constructed without the installation of engineering leachate controls. Indeed, until research over the last 15 to 20 years proved the contrary, available evidence suggested that these rock wastes were inert and would not threaten groundwater quality. Therefore, there is a need to identify the environmental impacts of these rock waste emplacements and develop groundwater remediation strategies at existing emplacement sites, as well as develop economically and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for these rock waste materials.This thesis presents a field study of a BFS emplacement located within the Illawarra region of New South Wales. High pH groundwater (pH 12-13) has been found to be migrating from this emplacement into an adjacent coastal saline lake, resulting in severe impacts on fish and benthic fauna. An innovative engineering  solution, which involves the installation of a low pyrite CWD permeable reactive wall at the site, has been proposed and tested. Depending on the particle size, the equilibrium pH of this CWD material ranges from about 7.5 to over 9.0.Field monitoring has been conducted to assess the hydraulic performance and reactivity of the CWD wall. A consistent and significant pH drop across the wall has been observed; the pH at the effluent end of the wall averaged 7.2 over the 825 day monitoring period. In addition, the wall was not found to impede natural groundwater flow. A three-dimensional MODFLOW model of the site and the wall reveals that flow through the wall conforms to fundamental flow equations.Laboratory batch and column tests have been conducted to develop a conceptual model of the chemical interactions within the CWD wall. According to this model, the primary pH reduction mechanism is the deprotonation of reactive amphoteric oxygen sites at the clay edge surfaces and gibbsite basal surfaces within the CWD. This is an acid-base controlled reaction in which protons are drawn into solution by the concentration of hydroxide ions. Deprotonation of clay surfaces results in negatively charged surfaces that attract and adsorb available cations (primarily calcium) from solution.The conceptual model has been used to develop a quantitative PHREEQC geochemical model of the wall. This model has been thoroughly tested using column test data and found to be valid. It is used to show that exhausted CWD is chemically stable and that the worst-case reactive life of the CWD permeable reactive wall at the BFS emplacement site will be 3.23 years. Under average rainfall conditions, the life of the wall should exceed 60 years.This solution is shown to be an efficient and economical engineering application of clay surface chemistry. It simultaneously addresses three issues relevant to groundwater remediation: the need for groundwater remediation strategies at existing rock waste emplacements, the need to develop economical and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for rock waste and the need for new field applications for permeable reactive walls.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">More than a calling: the experiences of new principals in christian schools in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Gannell, Gary</field><field name="description">The appointment of a person to the position of Principal is a momentous time in the life of a school. It is also a significant time for the individual appointed to that position, and all the more so if it is that persons first appointment to a principalship. The new Principal has to learn a new task and, in many cases, a new school culture. New Principals in Christian schools face the challenge of learning to be a Principal within a unique school culture. The Christian school is a faith community, where the students, parents and staff expect to see the new Principal express his or her faith through every facet of their leadership and teaching. The employing body, made up of parents and, in many cases, teachers, might approach their role as employers, and demand that the Principal approach his or her role as Principal, in such a way that places unique demands on the new Principal. This research followed the journey of three individuals in their first year as Principals of Christian schools. The focus question of this research was: What are the experiences of Principals in New South Wales Christian schools during their first year in the role? The research involved a series of seven interviews with each of these three Principals during their first twelve months as Principals of a Christian school in New South Wales. It explored their feelings and what relationships and tasks each one faced that generated these feelings. By exploring these matters, the research did not seek to establish any predictions regarding what every new Principal in Christian schools will face, but it sought to propose issues that need to be considered whenever a neophyte Principal is appointed. These issues are relevant to the candidates for the position of Principal and his or her family, the Board making the appointment, and to the wider Christian School Movement. A person who seeks to engage in the role of leadership of any school needs to be properly equipped to face the task. To truly lead a Christian school of the type explored in this study, the prospective Principal needs to have a Christian worldview that is in keeping with that of the school community. The equipping required to lead a Christian school is therefore both spiritual and professional. This research concluded that there are a number of matters worthy of consideration when a person is to be appointed to the position of Principal for the first time. While many of these issues may be unique to first time Principals in Christian schools, many are also relevant to new appointments of experienced Principals to Christian schools, schools founded on other faiths and to secular schools. These issues of calling, role descriptions, training, induction, mentoring, staffing issues, Principal welfare, and welfare of the Principals family may need consideration pre-appointment, on appointment, on commencement and on an ongoing basis. Throughout the research, the researcher became a quasi-mentor. Because of the nature of the research, there was an opportunity to reflectively consider what might be required of a mentor of new Principals in Christian schools. This consideration was initially not intended to be a part of the research, but became what is hoped will be a useful outcome of this project.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure/function studies of the alpha-crystallin small heat-shock chaperone proteins</field><field name="creator">Treweek, Teresa Mary</field><field name="description">Alpha-crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family which exists as a multimer of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin subunits in the ratio of 3:1 in the lens, where it was first identified. It is an intracellular molecular chaperone, capable of interacting with a multitude of target proteins to prevent their aggregation and precipitation. Initially considered to be solely a lens protein, individual alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin proteins have since been found in other organs with alphaB-crystallin in particular appearing to play a role in many neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimers, Parkinsons and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases). Due to the dynamic nature of alpha-crystallin oligomers and the propensity for subunit exchange, crystallisation of the protein has been impossible. As a result, the mechanisms by which alpha-crystallin functions remain elusive, as does a complete picture of the chaperones quaternary structure. In this study, recombinant human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin were expressed and purified using conventional methods (Horwitz, J., Huang, Q-L., Ding, L. and Bova, M. P. (1998) Methods in Enzymology 290:363-383). A series of mutants of alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin were also constructed, with mutation sites concentrated in the C-terminal region of the protein and in particular the solvent-exposed and flexible C-terminal extension. This extension, which comprises 10 and 12 amino acids in human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin, respectively, behaves in a similar manner to an unstructured peptide in solution. Previous NMR spectroscopic studies have indicated that it serves a crucial role in binding target proteins. C-Terminal extension mutants K175L, K174A/K175A, E164A/E165A, I159A/I161A and R163STOP (alphaB-crystallin) and S172L, T168L and R163STOP mutants (alphaA-crystallin) were produced and purified in the same manner as for the wildtype proteins. The expected masses of mutants were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Complete purification, however, of S172L and R163STOP alphaA-crystallin was not achieved due to decreased aggregate size and excessive hydrophobicity, respectively. Purified wildtype and mutant proteins were structurally and functionally characterised using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. These included chaperone assays under both reduction and heat stress with insulin and beta(subscript L)-crystallin as target proteins, respectively, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, thermostability studies, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Many of the alphaB-crystallin mutants purified successfully and provided insight into specific amino acid residues that are important for the chaperone action of the protein. These include the I-X-I motif at the C-terminal end of the protein which is highly conserved throughout sHsps and is thought to be critical for oligomeric assembly. Mutation of both isoleucine residues in the alphaB-crystallin I-X-I motif to alanine resulted in a protein which formed larger oligomeric complexes than the wildtype protein. Truncation of the C-terminal extension of alphaB-crystallin resulted in a protein with severely impaired chaperone ability, increased tendency to aggregate and disrupted secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. These results suggest that the polar and flexible C-terminal extension is also necessary for uniform oligomeric assembly as well as for the solubility of ?-crystallin as a whole. Chaperone and thermostability studies on the double glutamic acid mutant (E164A/E165A) showed that these highly charged residues are critical to the solubility of alphaB-crystallin at higher temperature. Consistent with this, ion-pairs and the formation of salt bridges between charged amino acids on the surfaces of thermophilic proteins are thought to be responsible for their increased thermostability. Recombinant human alphaA- and alphaB-crystallin were uniformly (superscript 15)N-labelled for the purposes of 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) studies. Measurement of (superscript 15)N relaxation time constants (T[subscript 1] and T[subscript 2]) and (superscript 15)N Nuclear Overhauser Effects (NOEs) for both wildtype proteins and the K175L and I159/I161A mutants of alphaB-crystallin have provided detailed information on the relative flexibilities of residues in the proteins C-terminal extension. Substitution of a leucine residue for the C-terminal lysine (K175) increased extreme C-terminal mobility and substitution of the isoleucine pair of the I-X-I motif with alanine residues led to a disruption of flexibility throughout the C-terminal extension. (superscript 15)N T(subscript 1) and T(subscript 2) and (superscript 15)N NOE values were also determined for (superscript 15)N-labelled alphaA-crystallin in the presence of reduced alpha-lactalbumin in order to gain information on changes in the flexibility of the C-terminal extension upon chaperone interaction with a stressed target protein. Upon formation of a chaperone-target protein complex, the flexibilities of C-terminal residues of alphaA-crystallin were equalised across the extension indicating that the entire extension was involved in interaction with the target protein to some extent. The R120G alphaB-crystallin mutant, which is associated with desmin-related myopathy and cataract in humans was also expressed and purified for the purposes of further structural characterisation. Previous studies on this mutant have provided some ambiguous results with regard to its chaperone ability and general structural stability. It was found that in addition to being intrinsically unstable and susceptible to unfolding, R120G alphaB-crystallin underwent C-terminal proteolysis with time. Furthermore, R120G alphaB-crystallin exhibited marked substrate specificity and in fact, acted as an anti-chaperone in the presence of reduced ?-lactalbumin. Under these conditions, R120G alphaB-crystallin promoted the aggregation of the molten globule state of alpha-lactalbumin and co-precipitated with it out of solution. This study, therefore provided several insights into structural and functional aspects of alpha-crystallin small heat shock chaperone proteins.

The area of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications systems has received enormous attention recently, as they can provide a roughly linear increase in data rate by using multiple transmit and receive antennas. In a future, where communication systems may implement MIMO technology, mobile user terminals are desired to be small, lightweight and have extended battery life. This seems at odds with MIMO systems because, as described in this thesis, Multiple In Multiple Out receivers require either a large number of receive antennas and associated electronic hardware, and/or powerful signal processing which has a computational complexity that varies significantly with Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The key objective of this thesis is to increase the flexibility of mobile units by reducing the number of receive antennas needed to obtain near optimal performance and a reasonable level of complexity. After presenting a background on problems affecting wireless communications, such as fading and noise, this thesis describes current and future methods of overcoming fading, such as receive and Space-Time diversity. This is followed by introduction into Multiple In Multiple Out systems that actually utilize the multiple fading to increase the data rate of wireless communication systems. To increase the performance of previously proposed suboptimal decoders for symmetric systems, where there is an equal number of transmit and receive antennas, this thesis first proposes a scheme, called Reduced constellation for Sorted QR Decomposition (RSQRD) that significantly improves performance by producing a list of possible combinations. This list is then used by the Maximum Likelihood decoder to determine which combination of symbols has the best performance. This thesis then provides a demonstration of how a large complex constellation, generated by multiple transmit and a single receive antenna, can be divided into groups or Asterisms. This concept of dividing the large complex constellation is then used to develop a MIMO decoder called Asterism decoding and is extended for any number of transmit and receive antennas. Also proposed is how Sphere decoding, described in Chapter 5, can be used in conjunction with Asterism decoding to reduce the overall computational complexity of Sphere decoding for systems where the number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas. Finally it is shown how an Asterism decoding based decoder can be used in a simplified Turbo coded MIMO systems with the number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of receive antennas.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards holistic human-computer interaction evaluation research and practice: development and validation of the distributed usability evaluation method</field><field name="creator">Vrazalic, Lejla</field><field name="description">The traditional notion of usability localises usability at the system interface and does not take into account the context in which people use computer systems to do their everyday work. Recently, arguments have been made by a number of researchers that this notion of usability is outdated and inadequate because it fails to address the use-situation. Proposals have been put forward to extend our current thinking about usability to include the usefulness of systems. The usefulness of systems is manifested in the use-situation because usefulness cannot be understood outside the context in which the system is employed to perform real-life activities. To extend the traditional notion of usability to include the usefulness of systems, Spinuzzi (1999) introduced the notion of distributed usability which views usability as a property of humans interaction with a system, rather than a property of the system itself. Spinuzzi (ibid) argues that, instead of being localised at the system interface, usability is distributed across an entire activity that a human engages in using the system. This view of usability has significant implications for our current usability evaluation methods (UEMs) which are focused primarily on assessing the traditional usability of systems. As a result of this focus, the UEMs suffer from a number of problems and limitations, raising questions about their validity and reliability. This thesis aims to develop and validate a UEM based on distributed usability. The UEM has been named the Distributed Usability Evaluation Method (DUEM). It consists of four phases and is focused on assessing the distributed usability or usefulness of computer systems. Distributed usability is operationalised through the principles of Cultural Historical Activity Theory. Activity Theory is a powerful clarifying tool (Nardi, 1996b) for understanding and explaining human activities in context and, as a result, a suitable underlying framework for a UEM that aims to assess systems in this context. The validation of DUEM indicates that it overcomes most of the problems associated with current UEMs, however in the process of doing so it suffers from its own set of limitations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian universities in the information economy: electronic commerce and the business of distance education</field><field name="creator">Dean, Anthony Francis</field><field name="description">Using an argumentation approach in which argument is used as a research methodology and strategy, this thesis investigates, as its primary purpose, the relationship between distance education and electronic commerce. A second purpose, contingent on discovering the nature and extent of the relationship, is to discuss the possible use of an electronic commerce framework for better understanding the theory and practice of distance education in Australian universities. The thesis presents a series of arguments that together constitute the case being defended. The desired outcome is a case that is plausible, defensible, and logical. Whilst the thesis is focussed on Australian universities, it nevertheless draws extensively on international literature to provide evidence in support of the case being built. The thesis positions both electronic commerce and web-enabled distance education as outgrowths of the information economy in which the focus is upon trade in products and services which have information and knowledge as their principal constituents. It investigates the business models that have arisen in the domain of electronic commerce and then discusses them in relation to distance education enabled by electronic technology especially the world wide web. The dissertation concludes that there is a relationship between distance education and electronic commerce though the relationship is not yet mature. As a result knowledge and understanding of the nature and extent of the relationship is imperfect. Further research is also warranted to more fully answer the second research question, though it appears on the surface to be likely that an electronic commerce framework could add insight to the study of distance education theory and practice.

The literature highlights a gap between visionary rhetoric and current practice. It is argued that such a gap exists because there is not enough detailed description provided about Web-based innovations at the level of interaction and pedagogy. This study addresses this gap by examining the interactions established among students and an instructor in a postgraduate subject delivered using World Wide Web and videoconferencing technologies. The purpose of the study is to inform the evolution of pedagogical strategies for Web-based learning environments. The method of inquiry was a collective case study comprising two cases, which were two implementation cycles of the same subject. Both cases involved two geographically separated groups of students and the technology was used to facilitate interaction between the two groups. The insights gained from the first case were used to redesign the teaching and learning environment for the second case. Data collection occurred through participant observation. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted; documents and artifacts were collected. Data analysis involved the identification of themes and computer-mediated communication (CMC) content analysis. Three questions guided the investigation. (1) What kind of interaction can be established in a technology-supported learning community? (2) What is possible in the technology-supported learning environment that is not possible without the use of technology? (3) What are the perceptions of the instructor and the learners in terms of the learning outcomes generated? In both cases students interacted with the instructor, with each other and with the content. However, the way in which interaction occurred differed for each case. The role technology played, the subject structure and delivery, and the nature of the assessment tasks, surfaced as influential factors. The use of the technology facilitated opportunities for collaborative learning not easily achieved in conventional face-to-face settings. The instructor perceived effective learning outcomes were generated in both cases and the students in both cases viewed the subject as a positive learning experience although the learning process presented challenges. The conclusions drawn from this study are: both cases represented a Web-based constructivist learning environment; the change in pedagogy from Case One to Case Two represented pedagogical re-engineering; computer conferencing should be considered in postgraduate subjects as a 'means to an end' not an 'end in itself'; and there is no single generically applicable CMC analysis technique - it depends on the context in which CMC is used.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuro-fuzzy admission control in mobile communications systems</field><field name="creator">Raad, Raad</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problem of admission control in multi-service mobile communications networks. The work is divided into two parts, chapters 2, 4 and 5 look at multi-service admission control in the mobile domain, while Chapters 3, 6 and 7 propose Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy Admission Control schemes for Multi-service mobile networks.The thesis begins by examining guard channel techniques for guaranteeing better performance for handover connections with different classes of traffic. An approximate analysis for fixed multi-service networks is extended into the mobile domain. This analysis is then verified through simulation. The analysis of the mobile network is further extended to include the micro-cellular case. The simulation results and analysis lead to the development of a heuristic for the amount of bandwidth that needs to be reserved for different multi-service scenarios. A fundamental contribution of this thesis is the development of admission control schemes that apply to networks with a general cell dwell time distribution (such as lognormal and gamma distributions) that are different to the classic guard channel problem.In this thesis Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy admission control approaches are examined to meet performance constraints of call blocking probabilities and to optimize wireless channel utilization. A simple Fuzzy Logic controller is first implemented that allows the admission controller to make decisions about new calls attempting to access the network. This work is then extended to a completely adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Controller.The Neuro-Fuzzy admission controller allows for the training and adaptive learning of the arrival and service profile of calls in each cell. An analytical model is developed for use as the initial training set of the Neuro-Fuzzy admission controller. An algorithm that allows for the updating of the neural network as data is collected is also developed. The proposed model allows the Neuro-Fuzzy admission controller to handle different cell dwell time distributions. This makes the admission controller more applicable to more realistic cell distributions and highly adaptive to coverage areas which are not covered by current models. Finally, the same Neuro-Fuzzy logic controller is extended to allow more variables to be considered (such as user velocity and cell dwell time). The results obtained show that the original Neuro-Fuzzy controller handles the simulated scenarios without the need for more complex extensions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial integration of the MENA emerging stock markets</field><field name="creator">Marashdeh, Hazem Ali</field><field name="description">The main objective of this study is to examine the financial integration among four emerging stock markets in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, namely, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Their interrelationships with three developed markets, the US, UK and Germany, are also examined. The motivation behind this study is that, although a lot of research has been focused on stock market integration, the emphasis has been mostly on developed markets. Stock market integration in the MENA region has not been investigated deeply enough despite the region being of a global economic and political importance. To attain this objective, the study conducts recent econometric techniques on the monthly time series of stock market price indices. It starts with testing for a unit root in the presence of structural change at an unknown time of the break, using the Innovational Outlier (IO) model. To empirically examine the financial integration, the study utilizes the newly proposed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration. The ARDL approach has been recognized as more preferable in estimating the long-run equilibrium relationship than other cointegration approaches in small samples with mixed order process. Finally, the study explores the short and longrun dynamic relationships among these markets using Granger-causality within a correctly specified vector error correction model (VECM). The empirical results indicate that all variables show evidence of nonstationarity, even in the presence of structural change. The endogenously determined times of the breaks for all markets coincide with observed real events which affected each market. This result is consistence with the efficient market hypothesis as the nonstationarity random walk is associated with the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. Consequently, this result emphasises that the stock markets in the MENA region are efficient.The cointegration test results show that there are long-run equilibrium relationships among all stock markets in the MENA region. This indicates that stock markets in the MENA region move together in the long-run. So, at the regional level all markets are integrated. At the same time no long-run equilibrium relationship is found between MENA markets and developed markets. This means that the MENA stock markets are segmented from developed markets. However, Egypt was the exceptional case; the study found that the stock market of Egypt has long-run equilibrium relationship with the US and UK markets.The implications of these findings are analysed at two levels, the regional and international. At the regional level, the existence if cointegration among the MENA markets implies the existence of the law of one price (LOOP). This means that the potential of regional investors for obtaining abnormal profits through portfolio diversification is limited in the long-run. The reason for this is that as the MENA stock markets are cointegrated, abnormal profits will be arbitraged away in the long-run. However, despite no arbitrage opportunities in the long-run, investors can still achieve arbitrage profits through portfolio diversification in the short-run. At the international level, the results show that stock markets in Turkey, Jordan and Morocco are not integrated with developed markets. This means that there is no long-run impact from developed stock markets towards these markets. However, a longrun relationship is found between Egypt and both US and UK when Egypt is a dependent variable. Based on these results, there are opportunities for international investors to obtain long-run gains through international portfolio diversification in stock markets of Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Also at the same time, investors from these three countries have the opportunities to obtain long-run gains through investing in developed markets. The existence of long-run relationships between Egypt and both US and UK implies that the potential for investors from the Egyptian stock market to obtain abnormal profit through portfolio diversification in the US and UK is limited in the long-run. However, there are opportunities for achieving abnormal profit by investing in Germany as it is not cointegrated with the MENA markets. In the short-run, arbitrage opportunities and possible profits may also be achieved from diversification as the LOOP may not hold.In addition to these findings, an important contribution is made by this study. It contradicted Granger&#8217;s (1986) theory on the relationship between the existence of cointegration and market efficiency. Granger (1986) asserted that the existence of cointegration between two stock prices implies the ability to predict each price movement, which indicates market inefficiency. Also, this study does not fully agree with another stream of studies, such as Wallace (1992), Baffes (1994), Engle (1996), Ahlgren and Antell (2002) and Masih and Masih (2002) in which they asserted that cointegration does not necessarily imply market inefficiency or efficiency. However, what this study tries to bring out is that if cointegration exists between two stock markets then these markets are efficient in the long-run because the existence of cointegrated vector implies the (LOOP). Therefore, little or no arbitrage opportunities or possible benefit can be achieved from the diversification of a portfolio across markets. However, with the short-run error correction model (ECM), there could exist arbitrage opportunities and possible benefits from diversification. That is, the LOOP may not hold in the short run.The results of Granger-causality test based on the vector error correction model (VECM) reveal the existence of short-run causal relationships among the MENA markets. This means that these markets influence each other. Also, the results show that developed markets influenced stock markets in the MENA region. In the short-run, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from stock prices in Turkey, Morocco, the US and UK to Egypt. Also, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from Germany and the US towards Turkey. In addition, The UK and Turkey are found to Granger-cause the stock prices in Jordan. Finally, there is a unidirectional Grangercausality from Germany to Morocco.Finally, despite the empirical results show that there is a possibility of an increase in the portfolio equity flow to the MENA stock markets, the statistics of portfolio equity flow show little portfolio inflow to the region from developed countries over the period of study. Some of the reasons behind this situation are that most of these markets are still from some perspective underdeveloped, vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks and political instability in the region. Based on this, the study suggests that huge efforts should be carried on to improve the institutional reforms in these markets and increase the degree of openness for foreign capital. Also increasing the markets capitalization and adopting new technology are very crucial factors for attracting equity portfolio to the region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the possible influence of microorganisms on the uptake of trace metals by ulva lactuca</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Curtis</field><field name="description">Trace metals are actual or potential pollutants in estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Anthropogenic activities, such as mining, industries and waste streams, can result in an increased release of trace metals into the environment at concentrations that may impact on the health, biological diversity and use of coastal ecosystems. They can be transported in food chains after absorption from the water by plants and consequently assessing the behaviour of metals requires an understanding of the factors that control the uptake of metals by organisms. In an attempt to investigate the effect of microorganisms on metal behaviour this study examines the effect that bacterial concentrations in solution have on the uptake of two sample trace elements, cadmium and selenium, by the algae Ulva lactuca. Algae collected from the Coledale area were tested for metal uptake in the presence of bacteria cultured from waters in the same area. Different concentrations of bacteria in solution were inoculated into salt-water media that contained samples of the algae and known concentrations of radioisotopes of selenium and cadmium. The algae were measured, by radiochemical methods, for metal uptake rates under the different treatment conditions.No overall conclusions could be developed as it proved difficult to maintain measurable differences between the bacterial inoculant concentrations in the experimental media. The differing concentrations of the bacterial treatments was the main variable in the experimental design and thus an analysis of the other experimental results, such as algae uptake, against these treatments was inhibited by the lack of significant difference within the bacterial measurements. The study did, however, provide valuable information for developing new experimental procedures to improve any further research into this area. A modified experimental procedure is proposed so that the impact of this important component (bacterial concentration variation) on metal behaviour in coastal waters can be investigated in more detail.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of nano carbon doped MgB2 form of wire and bulk</field><field name="creator">Yeoh, Wai Kong</field><field name="description">The objective of this work is to further enhance the critical current density of the MgB2 superconductor by doping with the two carbon sources: multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) and nano carbon. The work in this thesis concentrates on the fabrication and characterization on the CNT and nano C doped MgB2 with main objective being the enhancement of the critical current density in the high magnetic field. Consequently, introducing effective pinning centres in the form of dopants to enhance the flux pinning will be the main task of this project.In this project, the effect of carbon doping MgB2 with carbon nanotubes and nano C on transition temperature, lattice parameters, critical current density and flux pinning for MgB2-xCx with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 under the various condition was studied. Both types of doping showed excellent Jc compared to the pure MgB2, with significant enhancement observed at higher temperature. Magnetic Jc(H) was enhanced by a factor of 72 at 5K for a field 8T and a factor of 33 at 20K for a field of 5T for nano C bulk samples, respectively. On the other hand, Jc(H) of CNT samples was enhanced by a factor of 26 and 13 under the equivalent conditions. In high field, transport Jc of magnitude 2122 A/cm2 and 3821 A/cm2 was observed at 4.2K and 12T for CNT and nano C doped MgB2. These results indicate that flux pinning was enhanced by the boron substitution for carbon with increasing processing temperature. However, it was found that the lattice distortion and optimum doping level is different in the CNT and nano C samples which is due to the reactivity of the carbon source, resulting in different carbon substitution rate. Due to better reactivity and homogenous mixing of nano C,  nano C doped MgB2 resulted in better improvement in magnetic and transport Jc(H), as compared to CNT doped MgB2. This is mainly because CNT fibres with high aspect ratio tend to entangle, which suppressed the reactivity.The depression of Tc, which is caused by the boron substitution for carbon, increases with increasing the doping level, processing temperature and duration for both types of carbon doping. By controlling the extent of the substitution and inclusion of carbon, we can achieve the optimal improvement of critical current density and flux pinning in magnetic fields while maintaining the minimum reduction in Tc. In addition, the values of Hc2 and Hirr are higher for CNT doped samples than for the pure MgB2 at the same value of T/Tc. The morphology of the CNT doped MgB2 is similar to that of nano C doped MgB2, but different from the pure MgB2. The microstructure exhibits noticeable nanoparticles with size around 10-20nm, which are believed to be MgO and MgB2.Magnetization measurements indicate a change in the critical current density with the length of nanotube and not with its outside diameter. This is due to longer nanotubes tending to entangle with each other, preventing their homogenous mixing with MgB2 and dispersion. Low intensity ultrasonication, as a method of dispersion of CNT&#8217;s into precursor magnesium and boron powder, was introduced to improve homogeneity of mixing of CNT&#8217;s with the MgB2 matrix. Ultrasonication of CNT doped MgB2 resulted in a significant enhancement in the field dependence of critical current density, while avoiding the side-effects that would occur at higher processing temperatures.Carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8217;s) have unusual electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. The elongated CNT&#8217;s induce anisotropy in Jc in relation to the direction of applied field in MgB2/Fe wires and the value of Jc for the carbon nanotube-doped wires is insensitive to heating rates. We believe that by taking the extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of CNT&#8217;s, the mechanical properties and thermal stability of CNT doped wire will be substantially improved. Studies on these properties are underway.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power quality data management and reporting methodologies</field><field name="creator">Herath, H. M. S. Chandana</field><field name="description">Deregulation of the Australian electricity supply industry is being accompanied by state regulator requirements for explicit statements on quality of supply backed up with field survey results. The continuous monitoring and storage of every voltage waveform at a selection of key sites will add significant expenses to the associated costs in managing the electricity industry while demanding an enormous quantity of information to be processed. This thesis gives a less comprehensive approach which may be accepted as a standard and consistent method of characterising the supply using simple set of power quality indices. Also presented is a power quality data management and reporting methodology which will give useful feedback to endusers, allowing assessment of operability of equipment as well as to the regulators and utilities, for the comparison of competitive distributor performance. This is supported by a power quality surveys of selected sites within electricity utilities in Australia.The thesis gives a method of analysis that can be used to conveniently convert the collected raw data into useful knowledge, covering various types of power quality disturbances i.e. continuous or variation type and discrete or event type. Literature suggests that there has been many studies undertaken on continuous disturbance characterisation and related indices. Comprehensive standards have been developed specifying objectives to be met with standard limits for all continuous disturbance types. However, there are no generally acceptable methods for characterisation of discrete disturbances and limits are not well defined in international standards. A generalised method is proposed in this thesis to characterise discrete disturbances which is essentially based on a Disturbance Severity Indicator (DSI) proportional to the customer complaint rate. Scaled versions of the CBEMA and ITIC curves have been used to give an approximation to customer complaints.The power quality reporting methodology suggested in this thesis is a consistent approach for power quality data analysis; categorised in to Short term, Medium term and Long term reporting, giving summary indices for each individual disturbance type and a single Unified Power Quality Index (UPQI) for each site and the utility. This approach would give an assessment of power quality rapidly, by means of representative numbers without overlooking important details. These indices, which are the result of characterisation and extraction from a large volume of power quality data, are easy to assess and representative of the actual impact of the disturbances they characterise. A novel methodology is also given to define discrete disturbance limits based on statistical information collected from large scale power quality surveys performed around the world.Further, Multivariable Linear Regression (MVLR) has been used as a tool to identify hidden patterns and relationships within a large quantity of power quality data in an Australian monitoring campaign. For this, a factor analysis model has been developed using MVLR and complemented with Data Mining techniques; this model reveals the good and bad factors that influence utility power quality. Finally, the power quality data management guidelines and reporting methodologies developed have been applied to representative sites of several Australian utilities, to illustrate their ability to rank sites for power quality improvements and to rank utilities for power quality benchmarking.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To develop and trial a new warfarin education program</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Judy</field><field name="description">The principal purpose of this study was to identify, develop and trial a new warfarin education program to enhance warfarin knowledge, management and compliance in a wider patient population, inclusive of the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group. This &#8216;high risk&#8217; group included patients who were elderly, had low literacy skills and came from non-English speaking backgrounds.Effective patient education is a central part of the practice of all health professionals because it helps to ensure safe and effective warfarin management. With recent increases in warfarin prescribing and warfarin-related adverse drug events the need for an effective patient warfarin education program is more apparent.The study aims to improve currently available warfarin education programs delivered to warfarin prescribed patients in a home-based setting. The new program is conceptually based on five key elements: improved health professional/patient communication and partnerships; improved warfarin compliance; simple, easy-to-read warfarin information, improved continuity of care between hospital and community settings; and improved patient follow-up. Unfortunately, during the course of the study, many similar strategies and interventions targeting these key elements were incorporated into the customary program, as well as the new program, which may have impacted on the final results of the study.The study was conducted from February 2003 to February 2004, on consenting patients who were prescribed warfarin and admitted to Illawarra Health&#8217;s The Ambulatory Care Team (TACT). This prospective study included 50 intervention patients receiving the new warfarin education program, and 52 control patients receiving the customary warfarin education program offered to TACT patients. Many of these patient participants also came from the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group, which included; the elderly, those with low literacy skills and those from non-English speaking backgrounds.The evaluation phase of the study involved comparing and contrasting the effectiveness of the new warfarin education program against the customary warfarin education program, in terms of the patients&#8217; warfarin knowledge, management and compliance. The patients&#8217; satisfaction with the information received and their therapeutic outcomes (therapeutic INR scores, healthcare visits and warfarin-related adverse drug events) were also compared and contrasted between the two programs.The findings of this study suggest that the new warfarin information booklet (APPENDIX 12) was written in a better quality, easier-to-read format, than was the Boots warfarin information booklet (2003). Overall, the trend in the results suggested that the new warfarin education program more effectively educated patients, including the &#8216;high risk&#8217; patients, about their warfarin therapy, as compared to the customary warfarin education program. The patients receiving the new warfarin education program were more knowledgeable about their warfarin, more confidently managed and complied with their warfarin therapy at home, and achieved better therapeutic outcomes, than did patients who received the customary warfarin education program. Interestingly, both the new and the customary warfarin education programs used in this study appeared to be more effective than other available warfarin education programs, achieving better warfarin knowledge scores and therapeutic outcomes, with fewer warfarin-related adverse drug events and healthcare visits.The implications of this study are that by targeting the five key elements of an effective warfarin education program we can help to improve warfarin knowledge, management and compliance in many patients, including those from the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group. Education based on the five key elements empowers patients to make educated decisions about their warfarin therapy; which in turn help to optimise their warfarin-related therapeutic outcomes and minimise warfarin-related adverse drug events.One of the major benefits of this research, is that the five key elements of an effective patient education program, used in this new warfarin education program, can be generically applied to other patient medication education programs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of data reporting techniques and analysis of continuous power quality data in the Vector distribution network</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Glenn</field><field name="description">Power quality (PQ) has been defined as the study of the sources, effects and control of disturbances that propagate via the electric power supply. The three principal stakeholders in power quality are the electricity user, the electricity supplier and the electrical equipment manufacturer, each of which has a different perspective on power quality. This thesis looks at power quality primarily from the perspective of the electricity utility. Power quality has traditionally been considered in terms of reliability of supply, and this has been assessed in terms of frequency and duration of interruptions to the supply. However, with the proliferation of electrical equipment that is sensitive to a variety of disturbances in the supply, the reliability of the supply can no longer be defined solely in terms of interruptions. A supply that suffers from disturbance levels that damage or cause misoperation of equipment can be just as expensive and inconvenient to a customer as a supply that suffers from sustained interruptions. Despite routine power quality monitoring by utilities becoming more common, there is still little standardisation in the methodology for carrying out such surveys. Standard methods for data acquisition, analysing and reporting the data are required. Standardisation is necessary to allow benchmarking of PQ levels between utilities and to allow the determination of typical disturbance levels. This thesis is an investigation into the practice of routine PQ monitoring by utilities, and in particular the monitoring and reporting of power quality by Vector Ltd (New Zealand). Vector owns and operates the lines network that supplies electricity to most of the Auckland area. Vector has made a significant commitment to PQ monitoring and a large amount of data has been gathered since monitoring began in 1999. The main purpose of this study has been to look at present PQ monitoring and reporting methods at Vector, compare these methods with current industry best practice, and to suggest ways in which these methods could be improved to better meet the needs of Vector. The focus of this study has been on continuous PQ disturbances (continuous voltage variation, voltage unbalance and harmonic distortion) as opposed to discrete disturbances (voltage sags/swells, transients). Deficiencies in existing analysis techniques have been identified, and an alternative index for voltage variation has been proposed. Methods for deriving seasonal and annual site PQ indices have also been implemented using data from the Vector network covering one full year. Statistical analysis of the data has also been carried out to determine the degree of influence of individual PQ disturbance types on the overall PQ level at a site, and to investigate the influence of each of the known physical characteristics of a site on its power quality performance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scale effects in multilevel modeling</field><field name="creator">Familar, Russell R</field><field name="description">In many instances data are available as aggregated measurements for a set of areal units that are arbitrarily defined in terms of number and boundaries. Analysis using spatial data is a multi-disciplinary subject attracting the attention of statisticians, geographers, physical and social scientists. The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) is the sensitivity of results of statistical analysis to the definition of areal units for which the data are available. The results vary with the level of aggregation and the configuration of the zoning system. Multilevel models offer an approach to the MAUP. Multilevel modeling is potentially subject to the MAUP, since different estimates of the variance components can be obtained if boundaries are changed or a different scale is used.This thesis presents results of experiments conducted to look into the scale effects of statistics calculated directly from aggregated data and statistics derived from a simple multilevel under different initial conditions. The analysis of spatial data is usually affected by the complex relationships between variables and the existence of spatial autocorrelation. A reason for multilevel models being subject to the MAUP is that, while the data available may be hierarchical, the population structure may be more complex. Theoretical and empirical investigations to link a simple multilevel model and spatial autocorrelation and the implications for the MAUP are conducted.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a more flexible inter-organizational workflow design: the application of local criteria principle</field><field name="creator">Liang, Geng</field><field name="description">Process oriented technique such as workflow management system is attracting increasing attentions in the e-commerce environment, especially from an inter-organizational workflow perspective. A soundness concept, which identifies if a workflow can terminate properly, is an important factor that needs to be considered when designing a workflow. In an interorganizational workflow environment, the soundness issues become more complicated considering the size of the overall workflow and the privacy of the workflow within individual organization. One of the major approaches to tackle this problem is to use local criteria principle. This principle allows the soundness of the entire inter-organizational workflow to be achieved without knowing the detail workflow of every participating organization. This way, the privacy problem is addressed. Moreover, the coordination effort among business partners to ensure soundness can be reduced. However, this principle sometime can become too restrictive when we attempt to ensure the overall workflow is sound while changes are made to the workflow. It is not always easy to reach a balance between achieving soundness and flexibility. The public-to-private (P2P) approach is one of the important inter-organizational workflow design methods that follow the local criteria principle. The concept of branching bisimulation is considered as the local criterion in the P2P approach. This research investigates approaches to make the P2P approach more flexible by proposing a limited equivalence concept in an inter-organizational workflow context that can function as a local criterion. This research will also prove that this new local criteria concept will make the overall inter-organizational workflow sound.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic removal of electron contamination in radiotherapy x-ray beams</field><field name="creator">Oborn, Bradley M</field><field name="description">Removal of contamination electrons to lower patient skin dose from Linac produced radiotherapy x-ray beams is a serious issue in modern radiotherapy. Such removal can be achieved via the use of a magnetic field and is the subject of investigation in this thesis. The magnetic deflector consists of two separate and adjustable banks of permanent Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets held in a simple Aluminium frame, which slots into the accessory mount of a conventional Varian Clinac 2100C Linear Accelerator. The deflector allows x-ray beams with field sizes of up to 30x30 cm2 (source to surface distance of 100 cm) to pass through without interference, and weighs less than 20 kg. The deflector generates a maximum field of 0.21 T between the magnets along the central axis for a 10 cm magnet bank separation, and similarly 0.07 T for a 20 cm separation. Using the magnetic deflector, experimental measurements at the central beam axis show entry doses that approach that of the theoretical entry dose without electron contamination (Monte Carlo predictions) for 6 and 10MV x-ray beams. These range from 25% (6MV, 10x10 cm field size) to 55% (10MV, 20x20 cm field size with Perspex block trays) relative dose reduction at the phantom surface. Theoretical modelling has been performed which confirms the removal of the electron contamination for these typical clinical x-ray beam energies and field sizes. Pure electron beam path modelling has also been studied using this technique for determining the accuracy of the modelling technique. Results agree closely with experimentally observed values for 5 clinical electron beam energies between 6 and 20 MeV. The theoretical simulations are based around 3-dimensional modelling of the path of the contamination electrons as they travel through the magnetic field set up by the deflector (MATLAB). The magnetic field data used in modelling has been generated by a finite element package (Maxwell 3D). The experimental verification methods include the use of radiographic film and Attix parallel plate ion chambers with solid water phantoms for both qualitative and quantitative measurements.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An appropriate manufacturing strategy model for the Thai food processing industry</field><field name="creator">Pongpattanasili, Chaitamlong</field><field name="description">Thailand is well recognised for its high potential as an agricultural country and major food supplier. It provides a major source of agricultural product and agricultural manufacturing based industries. The most important sector is the food processing industry. This area is the most important sub-sector in Thai industry. The value in exports in the year 2002 was approximately 14.4% of the country&#8217;s total GDP. However, a high potential for growth still exists.Food production in Thailand is based on local agricultural raw materials, comprising of fruit and vegetables, cereal and oils, fish and livestock and provides employment to 20 million people within the agricultural and food processing sector. This thesis discusses the characteristics of the Thai food processing industry and suggests an appropriate manufacturing strategy model is needed in order for it to achieve manufacturing excellence.This study presents a classification of the Thai agricultural industry and compares one of its sectors, the agricultural manufacturing industry with another industrial sector viz. the electrical/electronic industry. The thesis investigates both industries contribution and reveals why the food processing industry is important for Thailand. After an overall analysis of the industry and its importance, the results of a survey of 350 food processing companies are compared, including characteristics of the Thai food processing industry, the focus of manufacturing strategies and the implementation of manufacturing practices.Based on this, and in order to assist the Thai food processing industry to achieve manufacturing excellence, the thesis then develops an integrated model combining GMP, HACCP, TPM and TQM, and provides guideline for their implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing visual literacy: an investigation into upper primary teachers' construction of visual literacy teaching</field><field name="creator">Atkins, Sarah-Jane</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the conceptual and practical construction of visual literacy philosophy and pedagogy within the broader context of effective literacy teaching. More specifically, the study set out to illuminate the key features of visual literacy as a course of study and a dynamic teaching and learning domain, as well as identify teachers' rationale and motivation for instigating educational change within their literacy teaching to encompass the teaching of visual literacy. The research literature from social change theorists demonstrated that multiliterate practices are required by individuals in contemporary western industrialised society and visual literacy holds a key place within the set of literacy practices needed to be literate in the twenty first century. Furthermore, a large body of socio-cultural theories make claim to where literacy education should be headed, and curriculum developers have attempted to respond to these recommendations. However, the review of the literature identified that there is a paucity of information regarding how teachers should be brought to including visual literacy in their classroom practices. It is in the dynamics of this gap between theoretical intentions and practical classroom outcomes that this research project was located. Three upper-primary teachers were identified who practically enacted a visual literacy curriculum within their classroom program. The research was an ethnography, with a bricolage of qualitative research methodologies employed to examine the unit of analysis; each participating teacher's conceptual and practical construction of visual literacy teaching. Case study was used as the vehicle for communicating with the reader. Data were largely derived from participating teachers through repeated semi-structured interviews, conversations and participant observations. Valuable data was also derived from field notes, document analysis and my research journal. Through talking to teachers, their personal theory and beliefs related to visual literacy were explored, and factors which influenced their choice to teach visual literacy were identified. Observations enabled descriptions of teachers' practical enactment of visual literacy teaching. Observations of teachers in their school context, and exploratory conversations highlighted the challenges teachers face in implementing this process of educational change. These findings, reported through the teachers&#65533; case studies, provided valuable insights that contributed to the development of a model for constructing visual literacy pedagogy. This study demonstrates that layered, multidimensional sets of conditions must be in existence for the practical enactment of a successful visual literacy program. Foundational to the practical enactment of a comprehensive and rigorous classroom visual literacy program is a strong theoretical visual literacy curriculum construct, where visual literacy is clearly theorised in published literature, theoretical visual literacy resources are widely available, and the construct is politically supported. Additionally, if the practical enactment of a visual literacy curriculum is to be successful, a change in teachers' personal vision of literacy is necessary. Teachers must re-evaluate what purpose they are trying to achieve with their literacy teaching and learning program so as to incorporate a multiliterate, visual literacy mind set. Furthermore, the presence of key conditions from the socio-cultural classroom context is supportive of the visual literacy teaching innovation: largely collegial support and the availability of resources. Finally, it is advantageous that teachers take an integrated and flexible approach to pedagogical choices and include visual literacy learning experiences from each of Luke and Freebody's (1999) four sets of literate practices. Additionally, this study identifies key components of the socio-cultural learning culture which potentially present barriers to the acquisition of each layer of conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pollination ecology and reproductive success of the Australian shrub Grevillea macleayana</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Samantha M.</field><field name="description">Theory predicts that plants that are more attractive to pollinators (via greater floral rewards) should have greater reproductive success, produce higher quality seed, and hence have greater fitness. Within a species, we assume that competition for effective pollinators is more intense because plants look the same, and thus, attracting pollinators may be more difficult. Moreover, plant-pollinator systems are highly variable and, in Australia, they have been subject to disruption by habitat fragmentation and the introduction of the European Honeybee. Ultimately, some individuals within a population will be more fit than others, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationships between floral traits and plant fitness. This study examines the links between floral rewards, pollinator foraging behaviour, reproductive success, plant mating system parameters, and some non-reproductive plant traits and environmental variables, in an Australian woody shrub. Variation may be evident in five primary components of plant-pollinator systems: (1) floral traits (e.g. flower, nectar, and pollen production); (2) pollinator foraging behaviour (e.g. insects, honeyeaters, and mammals); (3) reproductive success (e.g. pollen transfer, seed production and viability); (4) plant mating system and genetics (e.g. self-compatible species with low outcrossing rates) and (5) nonreproductive plant traits and environmental variables (e.g. plant size and density, climatic conditions). Our current understanding of the extent of intraspecific variation within these variables and how these variables interact within pollination systems is poor. This study quantifies intraspecific variation among Grevillea macleayana plants in each of these five components of the plant-pollination system, using three sites studied over three years. The broad aims are to: (1) quantify variation among plants in characteristics conferring attractiveness to pollinators (floral traits), pollinator foraging behaviour, reproductive success, and mating system variables and (2) determine how these components are related, and identify the interactions most important in explaining variation among plants. Grevillea macleayana is a rare, hermaphroditic, bird-adapted, medium to large shrub, with a large floral display. It has a fragmented distribution on the south- east coast of NSW, Australia. Grevillea macleayana is self-compatible and has low genetic diversity. It is visited by a suite of potential pollinators including honeybees, honeyeaters, and the Eastern Pygmy Possum. However, evidence suggests that honeybees do not facilitate pollen transfer. I quantified variation among G. macleayana plants in three floral traits: monthly inflorescence number; nectar production (i.e. volume per inflorescence and sugar concentration); and pollen production. I found substantial variation among plants in inflorescence production at every site. At each site, a small number of plants (three to five) produced over half the inflorescences for the study plants (19 in total), over the survey period. I also found significant variation among plants in nectar volume, but less variation in nectar sugar concentration. I did not detect significant variation among plants in pollen production. These results were consistent with previous studies on other species in the Proteaceae Family and provide evidence that floral display and nectar production are the most important floral rewards. I quantified variation among plants in four aspects of honeybee and honeyeater foraging behaviour: the number of honeybees and honeyeaters; the number of inflorescences visited per plant; the foraging time per inflorescence; and the foraging time per plant. I found significant variation among plants in at least one feature of honeybee and honeyeater foraging behaviour, for one or two survey seasons per site. Contrary to the expectation that all pollinators will respond positively to similar floral traits, there were very few similarities between honeybees and honeyeaters in how they responded to variation in floral characteristics. These results provide some evidence that honeybees and honeyeaters may be responding differently to variation in floral cues and rewards. I quantified variation among plants in two aspects of female reproductive success: monthly seed number, and nocturnal and diurnal pollen deposition. Plants varied substantially in seed numbers over the study period. Moreover, at each site, a small number of plants contributed to more than half the seed production of the survey population. I detected very low seed-to-inflorescence ratios, and these varied substantially among plants. However, plants with greater inflorescence numbers also had greater reproductive success (maternal seed numbers). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in pollen deposition between diurnal and nocturnal surveys, at two of the three sites. This result indicates that nocturnal pollinators may have an important role in pollinating G. macleayana plants. I quantified variation among plants in two aspects of the G. macleayana plant mating system, using six microsatellite loci: family outcrossing rates (i.e. calculated for individual adults and their seed); and levels of biparental inbreeding for outcrossed seed. I found very low outcrossing rates across all families, and some plants were significantly different from zero and from each other. I also found very low biparental inbreeding rates across all families. The very low family outcrossing rates detected in this study indicates that whilst this is a mixed mating system, individuals are predominantly selfed. I quantified variation among G. macleayana plants in six other non-reproductive plant traits and environmental variables that are likely to be related to plant vigour and hence, reproductive success: plant height, plant area, distance to nearest conspecific, canopy cover, leaf moisture content, and leaf photosynthetic yield. I found substantial variation among plants in height, area, and distance to nearest conspecific. I also found significant variation among plants in mean canopy cover, and slight, but significant variation among plants in leaf photosynthetic yield and leaf moisture. Having detected significant variation among plants (in three populations) in the previously described five key components of pollination ecology, I then explored the strongest relationships among these variables. I used correlation and regression analyses to test for significant or consistent trends between dependent and independent variables. The most important trends in this system were: - Significant positive regressions and correlations between inflorescence production (number and size) and nectar production (volume) and (nonsignificant) positive trends between inflorescence production and nectar production, suggesting no immediate trade-offs between resource allocation for inflorescence and nectar production. - Numberous significant regressions between floral rewards (inflorescence and/or nectar production) and both honeybee and honeyeater foraging behaviour. These results support previous studies that have found greater numbers of pollinators or greater foraging activity associated with greater floral rewards. - Significant positive correlations between seed production and both inflorescence and nectar production, suggesting: (1) no immediate trade-offs between resource allocation for floral traits and seed production, and (2) plants with greater floral rewards have greater reproductive success. - Significant negative relationship between outcrossing rates and inflorescence numbers per plant. Plants with more inflorescences may be receiving more honeyeater visits (and within-plant activity), resulting in increased geitonogamous pollen movement and decreased outcrossing rates. - Significant positive relationships between plant size (area or height) and both inflorescence and seed number, suggesting that larger plants may have greater carbon stores and resource availability. - Significant negative regressions and (non-significant) negative trends between both inflorescence and seed number and canopy cover, suggesting that increased shade may reduce photosynthetic yield and resource availability for inflorescence and seed production. The holistic approach used in this study has contributed to our understanding of intraspecific variation in plant-pollination systems and how this variation is related to plant reproductive success. Furthermore, my study has challenged some of the widely held beliefs about plant attraction to pollinators and added to our limited knowledge of some important plant processes (e.g. outcrossing rates) and their role in this pollination system. In trying to determine the most important relationships among the numerous components of the G. macleayana system, I have revealed a very complex plant-pollinator system. Whilst some of the relationships I found were as predicted, trends were not always consistent and it is clear that patterns of floral attraction, pollinator behaviour and reproductive success are not always intuitive.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'We film the facts': the Waterside Workers' Federation film unit, 1953 - 1958</field><field name="creator">Milner, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the history of the Waterside Workers' Federation Film Unit. Comprising three filmmakers, Norma Disher, Keith Gow and Jock Levy, this union production group operated in Sydney from 1953 to 1958. Within an environment which was generally hostile towards militant labour, it produced seventeen short films on a range of topics for the Waterside Workers' Federation and other labour and left wing organisations. To date, no comprehensive history of the work of the Unit exists. The work begins by giving a history of the Unit's operation. The second chapter explores the theoretical approaches to the topic. The Unit operated at a point of intersection of film, industry and culture, and the disciplinary areas of cinema studies, labour history and cultural studies are interrogated as to their utility in presenting a critical history of this group. The following chapter provides the context for the WWFFU, and examines the industrial, cultural and cinematic spheres of activity which existed as a background for the WWFFU's existence in Sydney from 1953 to 1958. Chapter Four undertakes a close analysis of three key films, examining how these filmmakers responded to industrial and political campaigns, and how the Unit's output related to its context. The final chapter reflects upon the provision of this history and the issues raised, including the changing nature of class in Australia, and representation within the documentary. This thesis contributes to a succession of Australian cultural histories. The localised milieux in which the Film Unit operated, its economic, political and social structures, were historically specific formations. Popular culture of the 1950s has often been positioned as predictable, but this is because a specific activist working class culture has seldom been examined. Bringing a localised working class cultural formation, such as the WWFFU, to a critical analysis is a valuable way to see beyond such positionings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of marketing's participation in new product development on its manifest influence: a test of a contingency model</field><field name="creator">Yu, Eddie Fu-Keung</field><field name="description">A substantial body of research suggests that new product development (NPD) is a critical potential source of competitive advantage and profitability for organisations. It has also been well recognized that new product development is a complex process that involves multi-disciplinary and multi-functional activities. This thesis initially argues a critical factor that influences the efficacy of the NPD process in the participation of different functional groups. Despite the strong theoretical link between the interaction of R&amp;D and Marketing and NPD success, empirical studies on this topic have had contradictory results. One important reason attributing to these inconsistent results is that few studies have distinguished participation from influence. While NPD researchers acknowledge that functional team members interact in the NPD process, participation is treated the same as influence, or is seen to spontaneously lead to intended influence. Consequently, few studies have examined the influence of functional groups within the NPD process. This obscures the effects of Marketing and R&amp;D's participation in the NPD process. This thesis aims to close this important knowledge gap by addressing two main research questions as follows: 1. What are the effects of Marketing's participation on its manifest influence in the new product development process? 2. How do the contingencies, such as organisational, individual and project factors, moderate the relationship between Marketing's participation and its manifest influence in the new product development process? A theoretical model with nine hypotheses has been developed to examine these two questions. The model was constructed by synthesising the NPD, organisation theory, socio-political and power literature, and the hypotheses so derived were tested using 114 NPD project data from a survey of R&amp;D managers in Hong Kong companies. The hypotheses testing process has gone through three stages. Firstly, the data were tested to ensure that the assumptions for regression analysis were met. Secondly, the main effects of the proposed model were tested using bivariate regression analysis. Thirdly, the contingency effects in the model were tested using moderated regression analysis. The findings of this study indicate that while Marketing's participation is positively related to its influence on R&amp;D in the NPD process, its influence was, to various degrees, moderated by the hypothesized three groups of contingency factors, namely new product project characteristics, individual factors and organisational factors. The introduction of control variable (team size and self-perceived influence) did not change the significance of the moderating effects of the contingency factors. This thesis has made four theoretical contributions. First, it has conceptualised and empirically tested the relationship between Marketing's participation in the NPD process and its influence on R&amp;D in that process. Second, it has created a new contingency framework to empirically investigate the effects of seven contingency factors on the relationship between Marketing's participation in the NPD process and its influence on R&amp;D in that process. Third, to reduce bias, the survey instrument was designed to measure R&amp;D's perception of Marketing's influence rather than self-reporting by Marketing, arguably considered as more reliable and accurate. Finally, despite its importance very few NPD studies have been conducted in Hong Kong particularly from an organisational behaviour perspective. This study will help advance the knowledge in this particular research area. Apart from theoretical contributions, this thesis has made several managerial contributions. The study findings suggest that management, in order to secure a better new product performance, should help build a well-represented cross-functional NPD project team. Management should also facilitate effective participation of functional representatives. Knowing the importance of the seven contingency factors to the effective function of the team, management should direct their effects positively to help achieve desirable goals that best serve corporate interest. To this extent, a 3-H model has been created to enable management to easier assimilate and apply complex theoretical concepts developed in this thesis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3-D dynamic modeling and simulation of a multi-degree of freedom 3-axle rigid truck with trailing arm bogie suspension</field><field name="creator">Li, Bohao</field><field name="description">This thesis concentrates on the modeling and simulation of a multi-degree of freedom 3-axle rigid truck.

The Lagrange's equation was used to obtain the motion equations and system matrices, and the numerical central difference method was adopted to obtain the system responses subject to sinusoidal road excitations, programmed in MATLAB. Furthermore, the eigenvectors, the seat bounce acceleration, the maximum dynamic tyre loads and the maximum suspension dynamic deflections were studied. ADAMS/View was then used to conveniently reexamine the model in the virtual environment as validation. Some advanced simulations such as sweep sine and triangular bump excitation were also conducted in ADAMS.

Twenty six participants were recruited in the Illawarra region of New South Wales to be involved in this study, which was conducted over a period of eighteen months. A methodology drawing on critical social science theory was used to explore the participants' understanding of the food system and to document the influence of critical reflection over time on participants' food choices. This approach differs from surveys of consumer opinions in that, after setting the initial agenda, it allows for the participants' concerns to become the focus. For health professionals this provides a rich source of information on people's concerns about the food system and also the priority of these for the individual. Such information is invaluable for the development of collaborative projects that aim to address environmental health risks within the food system from the consumer perspective.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fear of faces: a psychophysiological investigation of facial affect processing in social phobia</field><field name="creator">Horley, R. Kaye</field><field name="description">Social phobia (SP) is a common anxiety disorder that has received little research attention, particularly from a psychophysiological perspective. SP is characterised by a fear of evaluation by others in social contexts. Theoretically, this condition has been considered in terms of selective information processing biases towards threat-related social cues. Yet, the mechanisms underlying processing disturbances remain unclear. This thesis explored central and autonomic nervous system functioning in SP for the first time. The studies employed psychophysiological measures with realistic face stimuli pertinent to the evaluative fears of SP. Study 1 employed an objective marker of visual attention (the visual scanpath) to examine directly how individuals with SP (n = 15) processed happy, neutral and sad faces and a control geometric figure, compared to age and gender-matched healthy control subjects (n = 15). Unlike controls, the scanpaths of social phobia subjects showed an avoidance of eyes, but excessive scanning of non features. No scanning differences were evident in processing the geometric figure, suggesting that the disturbance was face specific. Study 2 additionally examined attentional responsiveness to an explicit threat-related (angry) face in a SP group (n = 22) compared with an age and gender-matched healthy control group and an anxiety control group (n = 17), employing concurrent visual scanpath and electrodermal measures. Study 2 confirmed Study 1 findings of hyperscanning of faces and avoidance of eyes in SP and initial findings of face specific deficits in SP. Scanning dysfunction evident in the SP, but not the healthy control or anxiety control groups indicated that the face processing deficits were specific to SP. Contrary to expectation, electrodermal activity in the SP group indicated a similar arousal profile to the control groups and no evidence for an anger specificity in SP was apparent in either the cognitive (eye movements) or autonomic (electrodermal) measures. In Study 3, event- related potentials were employed to examine the cortical processing of a threat-related (angry) and neutral face stimuli in a SP group (n = 27) compared with an age and gender-matched healthy control group and an anxiety control group (n = 17). The SP group was distinguished from the control groups by faster P2 and P3 component responses to anger, than neutral, as well as larger responses in the N2/P3 orienting complex in posterior regions. Findings were suggestive of an exaggerated orienting response to biologically salient signals of threat. The ERP findings provided important central processing information and the electrodermal findings important autonomic information. However, the most compelling findings from this multimodal study were the face processing disturbances, distinguished by an extended scanpath and avoidance of eyes. Given that face processing is so critical in social communication, these findings have particular relevance for clinical interventions providing for specifically tailored strategies for increasing eye contact.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling communication requirements in aged care using HL7 V3 methods</field><field name="creator">Frean, Isobel</field><field name="description">Australia and other western nations are actively formulating strategies that will increase the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) amongst privatesector providers of aged care. The drivers for this technological change involve population ageing reforms, concerns about the quality and safety of healthcare, and global strategies encouraging governments to transform the way they do business. This research set out to examine these drivers and to inform development of a national aged care ICT strategy in Australia. The research questions prompted an examination of how national health information systems and e-health reforms in Australia and overseas address aged care, with a view to describing a hierarchical structure of standards for interoperability using the Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM).HL7 refers to the international organisation involved in developing and supporting healthcare standards.A review of the implementation of national health and technology reforms revealed there are gaps in most western nation&#8217;s approaches to e-health reform when it comes to identifying the information management and communication requirements of privatesector aged care providers. Through the participation of aged care provides in Australia, detailed requirements were gathered using a Delphi approach and analysed using healthcare information modelling methods to inform the development of a hierarchy of Australian aged care messaging and communication standards.The methodology chosen for  ocumenting these requirements was the HL7 Development Framework (HDF), the methodology which all HL7 Technical Committees are required to follow in the development of Version 3 (V3) standards. The first three of the seven formal phases to the HDF were employed to document a consensus business vision for  nteroperability in aged care and some 82 storyboards. This provided detailed understanding of the likely system-to-system interactions and the associated application roles and receiver responsibilities of some 121 discrete interactions. Ten of these storyboards were subjected to international review as part of the published requirements for the HL7 V3 Care Provision standard in 2005. This comprehensive set of requirements informed development of an aged care Domain Analysis Model (DAM) whose elements were mapped to the HL7 RIM. This enabled the development of some early examples of how the aged care domain might be modelled using RIM conformant design models and how these might in turn be represented in an aged care Domain Information Model (DIM).Modelling the requirements of aged care providers using the HDF revealed four areas of communication complexity: Accessing an aged care service; Contractual documentation associated with securing and funding an aged care service; Effective coordination of service delivery; and Consistent documentation of services delivered. A number of solutions for addressing these complexities are proposed including migration of the current aged care referral process to an electronic application process; adoption of a new aged care case-management structure by collaborating healthcare and aged care providers; and adoption of a suite of national forms-based specifications using the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard. These proposals offer possible solutions for achieving the interoperability vision described in this research and they are supported by the proposed aged care DIM. They will, however, rely upon the adoption of uniform messaging standards by aged care providers and by healthcare providers interfacing with them such as hospitals, General Practitioners and Aged Care Assessment Teams. To engender adoption of such standards, a role delineation model for implementation of the proposed hierarchy of aged care messaging standards is described. Together, these finding offer practical contributions towards the development of a national strategy for the adoption of ICT in aged care which is capable of supporting the objectives of population ageing and quality and safety reforms.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the adequacy of the Philippine legal, policy, and institutional framework to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing</field><field name="creator">Palma, Mary A</field><field name="description">Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a global fishing concern considered as one of the obstacles in achieving sustainable fisheries. In the Philippines, IUU fishing is known to undermine national efforts related to the conservation and management of fisheries resources. International fisheries instruments, particularly the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU), recognises the increasing concern on IUU fishing and calls on States to adopt measures that would effectively address the problem.This thesis examines the adequacy of the Philippine legal, policy, and institutional framework to combat IUU fishing. It analyses the definition of IUU fishing provided under the IPOA-IUU and assesses how such definition applies within the Philippine context. The measures adopted in international fisheries instruments to address the problem are also examined. From the analysis, three sets of criteria are formulated to measure the adequacy of the Philippine framework to combat IUU fishing. The first set of criteria involve the application of flag and coastal State measures; the second relate to the application of port and market-related measures; while the third entail the adoption of &#8220;all State&#8221; responsibilities.It is concluded that by failing to satisfy most of the criteria established under international fisheries instruments, the Philippines renders its legal, policy, and institutional framework inadequate to address IUU fishing. The major areas of inadequacy relate to the Philippine definition of IUU fishing, the measures adopted by the State to address the problem, and the corresponding institutional framework for fisheries management. The thesis also provides specific options for legislative and policy reforms that would address the gaps in the current national framework in order to effectively prevent, deter, and eliminate IUU fishing in the Philippines.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to privacy preserving with ring signatures</field><field name="creator">Chen, YiQun</field><field name="description">A ring signature is a cryptographic primitive that enables a signer to produce a signature without revealing his or her identity. In this thesis, we propose two ring signature schemes for privacy-preserving applications over the Internet.First we design a protocol that enables a ring signer to receive an acknowledgement from the verifer. We propose two constructions. With the basic construction, the verifer can send a message back to the original signer while keeping the latter's identity hidden. Additionally, the verifer is assured that the signer is indeed the user in a group. We then extend our basic construction to a multi-party scenario. In the second construction, the verifer can discern a certain number of signers involved in the specific signature while their identities remain anonymous. We also investigate the possible applications of our schemes, such as in E-Commerce and Pay-TV.Then, we introduce the concept of identity-based anonymous designated ring signatures, which has not been studied before. This concept extends the existing notion of ring signatures in two ways: frstly, it allows a member of the ring to sign a message directed to a designated verifer. Secondly, we enable the concept of anonymous designated verifer. We show that it has useful applications in Peer-to-Peer networks and provide a construction based on bilinear pairings. Furthermore, we formulate a security model and prove the security of our proposed construction against a chosen message attack. We extend the scheme to construct a convertible version of the previous scheme, which enables a designated verifer to prove its participation in a particular session in case of dispute.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual study on perceptions of information seeking activity</field><field name="creator">Meloche, Joseph A.</field><field name="description">The evolution of information and communication technologies have heightened our awareness of information in our lives and emphasised the significance of our information seeking activities. This study proposes that the conceptualisation of information seeking, is and has been, metaphorically based in its many manifestations. The study approaches this topic by examining the understandings that active information seekers (and information professionals and educators) have of the activity of information seeking. The study also examines their understandings of the related terms information and information technology. Thus this study establishes the nature of these understandings through an examination of choices that the participants make in expressing their understandings. These are brought together through the use of metaphor into emergent categories. These ways of seeing are used as conceptual lenses to explore information seeking activity.The first part of this research establishes how information-seeking adults conceptualise information and information seeking in the early stages of their educational development. To accomplish this it examines literature on metaphor and pays attention to how participants describe their experience of information and information seeking. It goes on to determine if the metaphors or descriptions differ among various groups of information seekers and establishes if particular metaphors or descriptions are associated with particular perceptions. To accomplish this it is deemed essential to establish the particular understandings that information seekers use to explain their conceptualisations of information, information technology and information seeking. The expressed understandings are reviewed as they relate to the formation of meanings.The findings of this research are that most people see Information Seeking as a learning activity. This is significant, as the view of Information Seeking as Learning gives it a depth that could never be achieved by the traditional &#8220;bucket and brick&#8221;metaphor. Learning is much closer to the &#8220;gap filling&#8221; metaphor, but it is still something more. The statements on which participants placed most importance in the Q-sort show that Information Seeking as a learning activity is challenging, satisfying curiosity and ultimately individual. Thus designing technological tools to support Information Seeking Activity should take heed of the different perceptions of what this may mean as determined in this research.This is achieved initially by a review of relevant literature and subsequently through the use of a research methodology that allows information seekers to state how they understand information, information technology and information seeking. Q Methodology is used as the primary form of study. Activity Theory is also used to frame the analysis and discussion of the results. The integrated application of concepts and techniques of metaphor, Q-method and Activity Theory make the methodology used in this research as innovative and meaningful as the findings themselves.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protection of women's rights in Bangladesh : a legal study in an international and comparative perspective</field><field name="creator">Begum, Afroza</field><field name="description">Women&#8217;s legal rights are one of the most significant determinants of their status. In Bangladesh, a series of laws ensuring women&#8217;s rights have proven largely ineffective in promoting their positions. The prime reasons for this are: the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of laws, women&#8217;s inability to access legal proceedings, the traditional and cultural negative views about women&#8217;s rights, the absence of an accountable and transparent government, the expensive and time consuming judicial process, the lack of an efficient judiciary, and other socio-ecomic reasons. The core theme of the thesis concentrates on the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of laws, although viewing them within the context of those other factors. To signify the &#8216;ineffectiveness of laws&#8217;, emphasis is basically placed on the administrative and judicial approaches in the country to achieve the underlying objectives of law concerning women&#8217;s rights in pertinent areas. This study aims to promote protection of women&#8217;s rights by recommending remedies to flaws in prevailing laws in Bangladesh in four areas. Recommendations are made by reference to comparative and international practices. The primary arguments developed and maintained throughout the thesis are: (i) the protection of women&#8217;s rights is imperative to improve their status and law is an essential instrument to ensure these rights; (ii) the legislative, administrative and judicial efforts in Bangladesh are not appropriate and conducive to dealing with women&#8217;s rights; and (iii improvements in those efforts can better protect women&#8217;s rights. This study critically examines laws regarding women&#8217;s employment and political participation and the laws on dowry and rape. It also explores the ways laws have been structured and enforced in Bangladesh, and how law can be an effective means of women&#8217;s pursuit of rights. In so doing, this thesis analyses and compares a range of legislation and judicial decisions of a number of selected common law jurisdictions. Findings of the research demonstrate that the legal efforts of those countries resulted in significant improvements in traditional laws and enforcement procedures regarding employment, dowry as a form of domestic violence, and rape.Conversely, in Bangladesh, the age-old common-law grown formalities continue to dominate the legal and judicial proceedings and therefore fail to provide remedies to the contemporary needs of women. The present legal regime also suffers from an important flaw with regard to the scope and extent of liabilities for the violation of laws designed to protect women&#8217;s equal and special rights. The absence of any independent administrative body to monitor the compliance of laws presents another serious flaw in the current legal regime of the country. Such shortcomings eventually encourage and favour the wrongdoer, worsening the vulnerability of already disadvantaged women in the traditional culture of Bangladesh. In responding to such a situation, the present study recommends the reconceptualisation of laws to accommodate women&#8217;s unique experiences in Bangladesh. The study ends with a number of specific recommendations for ensuring women&#8217;s rights through strengthening the legal and enforcement mechanisms in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the impact of probiotic bacteria on enteric microbial diversity and immune response</field><field name="creator">Wu, Xi-Yang</field><field name="description">The mechanism of action of probiotics is based on competitive exclusion and immune modulation. However, the literature is scant on supporting data because of the failure to adopt a systems approach to probiotic functionality. This has been partially addressed in this thesis by taking into consideration the tripartite interaction between bacteria and bacteria in the enteric community; between bacteria and the host animal and finally, between the host immune response (innate or acquired) on the plethora of microbes that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract. A trial involving newly inducted cattle in a feedlot, formed the basis of initial attempts to assess the benefits of a commercial probiotic formulation - Protexin on intestinal health by enumeration of a select subset of cultivable bacteria species and by assessment of immune modulation. The results failed to demonstrate a significant change in the population dynamics of cultured faecal microbes but did show that Protexin stimulated immune responsiveness in T cells. Carcass analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in marbling or intramuscular fat deposition. In the course of examining the faecal microflora from feedlot cattle, the presence of high levels of Bacillus spores suggested that one possible reason for the lack of a growth benefit may be attributed to a high endogenous level of bacilli. Since there were no reliable methodologies for identifying Bacillus species, an alternative procedure was developed involving amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). With this protocol, we were able to show that cattle faeces contained large numbers of Bacillus spores representing different mesophilic species, where B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and B. clausii dominated. The presence of a stable population of coliforms in cattle faeces that was not altered by probiotic feeding highlighted the importance of developing better techniques to characterise diversity in E. coli, a potential food-borne pathogen of economic significance to the cattle industry. The use of virulence genes to genotype coliforms provided a method for differentiating between pathogenic, clinical and commensal isolates of E. coli. Altogether, a combination of uni- and multiplex PCR assays was developed to screen for 50 virulence genes (VGs) from 8 pathotypes of E. coli. There was a significant association between phylogroupings and VG ownership. This result showed clearly that the lack of or possession of VGs in member isolates of each phylogenetic group can be used to assess diversity and potential pathogenesis of E. coli. To understand better the importance of pathogenic enteric coliforms, an alternative animal model involving pigs with post-weaning diarrhoea was used to investigate the relationship between pathogenicity and commensalism by VG profiling. Porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were found to carry VGs identified in E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection. Furthermore, by using the appropriate methods of statistical analysis, VG profiling had the capacity to predict the pathogenic and commensal status of individual clones. By developing the capacity to rapidly characterise and genotype virulence and commensalism in E. coli, it is now feasible to examine how probiotic feeding can modulate the population dynamics of different community members in pigs with enteric disease, as well as changes in the coliform populations. Finally, another arm of the tripartite interaction involving bacteria and host interaction was modelled in vitro by examining the primary signalling events between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells. These investigations focused on the judicious selection of T84 as the reporter intestinal epithelial cell line because of low level expression of inflammatory transcripts from 6 other epithelial cell lines. Using a panel of coliforms genotyped for virulence or lack of virulence, the signalling events that followed on from the primary interaction between bacterium and cell, showed there was a lack of correlation between VGs and gene activation. Nonetheless, all the coliform strains tested varied in their capacity to signal transduce T84, confirming that this differential bioactivity can be exploited in the ranking of candidate probiotic strains. The differential responses seen with different E. coli strains and the lower and more consistent activation patterns recorded by LABs for both cytokine and chemokine gene activation, demonstrate that a semi-quantitative ranking of microbial bioactivity can be obtained. Such an approach if adopted in conjunction with an even wider panel of genes in a standardised in vitro environment can provide invaluable information on the selection of appropriate strains to be further tested in vivo.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When there is no speech : a case study of the nonverbal multimodal communication of a child with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Dreyfus, Shoshana Judith</field><field name="description">This case study uses Systemic Functional theory to describe and analyse the multimodal communication of an eight year-old boy, Bodhi, with both a severe intellectual disability and a severe communication impairment.

Within the turn, the study uses the theoretical resources of the interpersonal, ideational and textual metafunctions; above the turn, the study uses the resources of Exchange Structure Analysis.The corpus consists of data collected via tape recorder and observation notes. In order to capture the effects of different communication partners on the interactions with Bodhi, data collected via tape recorder consists of two transcripts of Bodhi communicating with different communication partners, his father and his grandmother. Each transcript was segmented into exchanges and moves. These were quantified to expose patterns of communication. Each move was examined for the presence of metafunctional meanings, which were also quantified. The study demonstrates that Bodhi makes meaning in ways that are different to speakers (of English). The findings also show that while he occupies a restricted semiotic space, having what could be construed as a form of protolanguage, Bodhi&#8217;s communication also has features of transition and adult language. The study also shows that while Bodhi is a persistent communicator, intent on getting his meanings across, contributions of the communication partner are crucial for the success of Bodhi&#8217;s meaning making. This success relies on a willingness on the part of the communication partner to work together with Bodhi in the joint negotiation and joint construction of meaning.This study also identifies a lack of research within the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication that describes the meaning making of ambulant nonverbal multimodal communicators with severe intellectual disabilities. The study also provides an opportunity for understanding how the &#8216;other&#8217;, the nonverbal multimodal communicator makes meaning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harming and healing : young women and the development of the autonomous self</field><field name="creator">Kyle, Renee L</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the behaviour known as deliberate self-harm in young women who are victims of parental incest. I am interested in identifying the impact and significance of incest in childhood on the development of young women&#8217;s agency and the significance of self-harming behaviour in that development. I argue that central to understanding the relationship between self-harm and incest is the notion of the self and the social and relational context in which it develops. The theoretical framework I employ to explain the development of self draws upon work in developmental psychology and feminist philosophical discourse on selfhood. My examination of the relationship between deliberate self-harm and incest explores the interaction between the three facets of an incestuous relationship: the sexual abuse of a child by her parent. The analysis of this interaction begins by articulating the significance of the relationship between parent and child on the child&#8217;s development. I contend that when a parent sexually abuses his child, he threatens his child&#8217;s attachment to him. Because this connection is integral to her psychological development, the child will try to remain in relationship with her parent despite his abuse of her, and will therefore develop complex, and sometimes contradictory, responses to the harm of incest that protect this attachment. I argue that deliberate self-harm should be understood in part as an attempt to remain connected to her abusive parent because of the importance of this relationship to the child&#8217;s developing sense of selfhood.To further illuminate the implications of incest on self-development, I articulate some of the psychological impacts of shame as it operates within an oppressive relationship such as parental incest involving a child. I attempt to show that the shame engendered by incest communicates to the child that she is an inferior and an inadequate moral agent, an agent unworthy of being treated respectfully by others. Because she is developmentally vulnerable, this shame profoundly shapes her understanding of herself, her responsibility and her agency.In light of such disturbances to the child&#8217;s sense of self, I critically analyse the popular conception of deliberate self-harm as primarily a coping strategy used to deal with the effects of sexual trauma. I argue that this is not the best way to understand, and respond to, the behaviour. I contend that current coping theory does not adequately attend to the influence of development or context upon an individual&#8217;s coping style, and because the selfhood of a victim of incest develops within an oppressive context, coping theory cannot significantly advance our understanding of the behaviour, not the development of appropriate clinical responses or treatment. The examination of the relationship between deliberate self-harm and incest is advanced by a consideration of the interplay between oppressive socialisation and personal autonomy. Drawing on the significance of relationships, trust and selfregard in the development of a child&#8217;s selfhood and autonomy, I show how the development of the skills of autonomy is compromised by the experience of incestuous abuse. I maintain that the behaviour of self-harm is indicative of such compromise in her skills.Given my argument that adopting a developmental approach to selfhood is conducive to reaching a better understanding of deliberate self-harm, I move to an analysis of the adequacy of the typical clinical response to young women who selfharm. I argue that the diagnostic tool of the clinical community constrains clinicians&#8217; ability to adopt a developmental approach when treating those who self-harm, and as such, is likely to lead to an inappropriate clinical response. I conclude with some suggestions as to how a clinician may, informed by the argument concerning the development of relational autonomy and selfhood developed here, more ethically engage with young women who self-harm.This thesis demonstrates that adopting a developmental, relational approach is conducive to better understanding self-harm in young women who are victims of incest. Such an approach illuminates the significance of relationships in the development of selfhood, which in turn better positions the clinician to address the issues which underlie her behaviour.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the role of the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM) in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes</field><field name="creator">Sanderson-Smith, Martina Louise</field><field name="description">The Gram positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is the major etiological agent of a variety of skin and mucosal infections in humans. Whilst the majority of GAS infection results in only mild, uncomplicated disease, the migration of GAS from superficial to deep tissue sites can result in invasive infection.In recent years, there has been a resurgence in severe GAS disease, however, the details of GAS pathogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated. Increasingly, subversion of the host plasminogen activation system is being implicated in the virulence of S. pyogenes. GAS display receptors for the human zymogen plasminogen on the cell surface, one of which is the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM). PAM has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain GAS isolates, but the mechanism of plasminogen binding by PAM, and the role of this interaction in the pathogenesis of GAS, requires further investigation. Thus, the focus of this thesis has been to characterise plasminogen binding by PAM and a number of naturally occurring PAM variants.Characterisation of PAM genes from 13 GAS isolates revealed that whilst thesemolecules are highly conserved in the c and d repeat domains, they display significant variation within the plasminogen binding repeat motifs (a1/a2). Percent identity to the prototype PAM a1/a2 repeat sequence ranged from 52% to 100% amongst the variants studied here. No correlation was seen between the presence of a PAM gene, or variationwithin the sequence of PAM, and site of GAS isolation. In order to determine theimpact of sequence variation on protein function, recombinant proteins representing six naturally occurring variants of PAM, together with a recombinant M1 protein were expressed and purified. Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of PAMvariants with biotinylated glu-plasminogen ranged from 1.58 nM to 7.58 nM. Effective concentrations of prototype PAM required for 50% inhibition of plasminogen binding to immobilised PAM variants ranged from 0.34 nM to 22.06 nM. These results suggest that while variation in the a1/a2 region of the PAM protein does affect the comparative affinity of PAM variants, the functional capacity to bind plasminogen at physiologicallyrelevant concentrations is conserved. Additionally, a potential role for the a region of PAM in eliciting a protective immune response was investigated using a mouse model for GAS infection. The a1 region of PAM was found to protect immunised mice challenged with a homologous PAM-positive GAS strain. These data suggest a link between selective immune pressure against the plasminogen-binding repeats and thefunctional conservation of the binding domain in PAM variants. Site-directed mutagenesis of full length PAMNS13 protein from an invasive GAS isolatewas undertaken to assess the contribution of residues in the a1 and a2 repeat domains to plasminogen binding function. Mutagenesis to alanine of key plasminogen binding site lysine residues in the a1 and a2 repeats (Lys98 and Lys111) did not abrogate plasminogenbinding by PAM, nor did additional mutagenesis of Arg101, His102 and Glu104, which have previously been implicated in plasminogen binding by PAM. Plasminogen binding was only abolished with the additional mutagenesis of Arg114 and His115 to alanine. Furthermore, mutagenesis of both arginine (Arg101 and Arg114) and histidine (His102 and His115) residues abolished interaction with plasminogen despite the presence of Lys98 and Lys111 in the binding repeats. This study shows for the first time that residues Arg101, Arg114, His102 and His115 in both the a1 and a2 repeat domains of PAM canmediate high affinity plasminogen binding. These data suggest that highly conserved arginine and histidine residues may compensate for variation elsewhere in the a1 and a2 plasminogen binding repeats, and may explain the maintenance of high affinity plasminogen binding by naturally occurring variants of PAM. Initial sequence characterisation of PAM variants in this study revealed aphylogenetically distinct PAM variant, PAMNS88.2. This variant binds plasminogen with high affinity (Kd = 7.58 nM), despite displaying only 52% identity to the classical a1/a2 repeat domain of PAM. It was therefore of interest to characterise the putative plasminogen binding domain of PAMNS88.2. Additionally, the association of GAS strainNS88.2, from which PAMNS88.2 was isolated, with the invasive disease bacteraemia, makes it a candidate for virulence studies employing the recently developed human plasminogen transgenic mouse. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative plasminogen binding site indicated that as with PAMNS13, PAMNS88.2 does not interact with plasminogen exclusively via lysine residues. Mutagenesis to alanine of lysine residues Lys96 and Lys101 reduced but did not abrogate plasminogen binding by PAMNS88.2. Plasminogen binding was only abolished with the additional mutagenesis of Arg107 and His108 to alanine. Furthermore, mutagenesis of Arg107 and His108 abolished plasminogen binding by PAMNS88.2 despite the presence of Lys96 and Lys101 in the binding site. Given that GAS strain NS88.2 is associated with the invasive disease bacteraemia, and is virulent in the humanised plasminogen transgenic mouse, the successful abrogation of plasminogen binding by PAMNS88.2 may facilitate the development of a PAMNS88.2 allelic replacement isogenic mutant for use in future studies involving this model.This study examines in detail the interaction of PAM and PAM variants with the human zymogen plasminogen. The maintenance of plasminogen-binding function in spite of binding site sequence variation suggests that the ability to interact with plasminogen is evolutionarily advantageous to a subset of GAS isolates. Additionally, this studyprovides previously unreported details of the ability of PAM to interact withplasminogen independently of binding site lysine residues. These findings haveimplications for both the future identification of novel plasminogen binding proteins, and may facilitate both the understanding of the role of PAM in GAS disease, and the development of therapeutics to assist in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infection.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From periphery to centre: shaping the history of the central peninsula</field><field name="creator">King, Philip</field><field name="description">Southeast Asia as a regional category of analysis has long been a contested one. Debates over the nature of the cultural matrix or the ecological factors that have produced a regional identity have driven some of the most innovative research in the field of Southeast Asian studies since the Second World War. These debates have not been limited to the types of external boundaries that may help to distinguish the region sandwiched between India to the west and China to the northeast. As the latter have more or less stabilised, attention has increasingly been directed towards the internal composition of the Southeast Asian region and the conventions employed to organise a highly diverse collection of states and peoples. Historians have grown increasingly wary of the dangers in writing history as a means of justifying current political geographies and continue to seek out ways of countering the inherent biases of colonial sources that serve as such an essential window into the past. Once conventional spatial models of a distinct mainland Southeast Asia complimented by a sprawling insular landscape are today splintering as new research points towards the trade networks and patterns of mobility that paid scant attention to any such imaginary divides. In the process new spaces that have formerly existed at the margins of scholarship on the region are emerging as valid subjects of inquiry. Areas and subjects long regarded as peripheries on conventional maps of the region are moving back to the centre. This thesis examines one such &#8216;periphery&#8217; that I refer to as the central peninsula region. This central peninsula is not an essentialised space with distinct territorial and cultural boundaries, but a category of analysis from which we may begin to destabilise conventional representations of that area that today comprises the southern border provinces of Thailand and the northern state of Malaysia. Rather than persist with conventional representations of a vertical civilisational fault line that represents a transitional zone between the mainland and island worlds, what I seek to present in this thesis is an extended critique of conventional colonial and nationalist narratives that have taken a distinctly vertical and centralist view of this region. My study commences from a set of basic inquiries such as whether there are there ways of writing the history of this region beyond that of civilisational/nationalist narratives that appear designed to justify patterns of conflict in the borderlands? To surmount such representations we need to ask in what ways have modern political boundaries and nationalist/civilisational identities been projected into the past to obscure interactions between non-bounded communities and narratives of peace and indigenous forms of modernity? In answering these questions, I seek to demonstrate how the critique opens up new spaces of research&#8212;new histories. In the case of this thesis, much I my interest is directed towards the interior of the central peninsula, an area that has been doubly disadvantaged by the coastal bias exhibited in many histories of the peninsula in general. In asking these types of questions, a major linking theme in this study is the question of progress and development. Given my desire to shift our attention from centre to periphery as a means of recovering a non-state history, examining the link between conventional historical narratives and western theories of progress that have privileged the role of the &#8216;civilised&#8217; centre is a logical step. Modernity&#8212;that great eighteenth and nineteenth expression of technological progress and civilisational sophistication&#8212;critically shaped the way in which colonial and later nationalist observers saw the world around them and speculated its past. But as we are frequently reminded when reading contemporary revisions of Southeast Asian history, modernity was not a condition that was incubated in the centre. Modernity a condition that was fashioned through a constant engagement with external (read indigenous) regions and actors. Likewise, peripheries were not areas that had experienced but a partial experience of modernity, but a discursive Other that was required to give the supposed advancement of the centre definition and meaning. To critically deconstruct narratives of progress and modernity by showing them as a product of interaction therefore serves the duel purpose of deconstructing representations of the peripheral Other. From here we can begin to fashion alternative histories. Such a critical reflection on the role of western narratives of progress and civilisational advancement are highly timely given that many governments in Southeast Asia are currently promoting the development of various state peripheries in accordance with economic theories not unlike those that underpinned a century of colonial exploitation. The Malaysia-Thailand borderlands are one such region that has been identified as subregional development zone or growth triangle that will supposedly act as a catalyst for the re-discovery of a vibrant nonstate regional identity. Whether this will be the case or not is the question that represents the end-point of this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary maritime pressures and their implications for naval force structure planning</field><field name="creator">McLennan, Bruce Clark</field><field name="description">The contemporary determinators of Australia&#8217;s naval force structure are generally derived from threat based calculations as modelled through scenario focused exercises. Analysis, future capability development, and force structure planning, are principally configured for high-intensity war-fighting roles against a similarly sophisticated enemy, in the defence of the Australian mainland&#8212;in the belief that forces structured for the defence of Australia and its approaches can meet all the tasks asked of it by the Government. The underlying assumption is that geostrategic imperatives should shape strategy as well as force structure. The focus remains firmly affixed to &#8216;contest&#8217; and the assertion of strategic security to the determent of constabulary control. It also drives the tendencies for &#8216;bigger/brighter and more gigabytes&#8217; that lead to the unsatisfiable demands in defence expenditure and the over-specification of required capability. This thesis argues that a historical trend analysis offers a further dimension in appreciating naval force structure emphasis, claiming that there are at least three contemporary pressures that should be exerting influence on a nation&#8217;s naval planning&#8212;these pressures are maritime geopolitical evolution through a dominant sea power hypothesis, the asymmetric response to technology that has changed the character of warfare, particularly at sea, and the inevitable progression of ocean exploitation and enclosure that has dawned the modern era in oceans governance. All three forces are applying their pressure in a similar direction&#8212;away from the traditional ship-of-war, towards the ship-of-law and the ship-of-expedition over the shore. To argue this thesis there are three supporting suppositions: The first supposition contends that we have entered the era of Pax Americana&#8212;an era of unchallenged maritime supremacy. Like the eras of Pax Romana and Pax Britannica before it, with Pax Americana ruling the oceans and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation, there is now an emergent need to shift the balance of force structure away from those naval forces that are needed to fight for the control of the seas&#8212;combat and contest&#8212;and towards those naval forces that are going to use the sea control given to them&#8212;regulation and utilisation. The second, that the character of warfare has changed: that conventional warfare has moved to the Third World. Yet the modern ship-of-war is at the forefront of technological development and the product of a nation&#8217;s technical ability and resource. It is designed to fight against a similarly sophisticated enemy; against a platform that resembles itself in technical sophistication. It is also a weapon of statecraft, as only States can afford the infrastructure and costs to support them. If conventional warfare has indeed moved to the Third World, then it has also moved against States that do not have the technical skills and resource base to support the modern warship&#8212;the traditional ship-of-war no longer has an equally sophisticated enemy. The third, that the modern practise of State sovereignty expansion and ocean enclosure that has dawned the modern era of ocean governance is a fundamental evolution in ocean usage. It is now being reflected in, or by, the increased awareness of, and emphasis on, &#8216;constabulary tasking&#8217; such as resource management, environmental protection, immigration regulation, quarantine inspection and trans-national crime enforcement&#8212;the demand for a ship-of-law.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creativity under the glass ceiling: a study using a contextual theory of creativity as a framework</field><field name="creator">Botticchio, Margaret</field><field name="description">The purpose of a study of creativity under the glass ceiling was to make a contribution to a viable theory of creativity. Six case studies were constructed in which each of six women talked about an individual experience of creative work in a distinct domain. These data were not fully included in the early development of a contextual theory of creativity. The initial proposal of a contextual theory of creativity was developed by asking questions of visibly creative people. Because women were not found in sufficient numbers at the top of many domains or professions, these important questions were not asked of them. When women&#65533;s data appeared in the research they were not valued. In this way contextual theory failed to show a complete understanding of creativity phenomena and was not tested on diverse populations. The six stories came from interviews with women who demonstrated a serious commitment to their work in different domains. The interviews and the analysis were structured on the contextual framework developed by Csikszentmihalyi and Gardner. The cases challenged the contextual view of creativity by using the contextual framework with women and by trying to determine whether the contextual theory could accommodate these and other different experiences of creativity. Analysis of the case studies showed that the women&#65533;s experience of creativity was captured and explained by the contextual framework. The new dimensions of creativity discovered by this research extend the theory, enabling greater flexibility in further testing on other populations and situations. This study of creativity under the glass ceiling offers support for a social theory of creativity that is inclusive of varied experiences of creative enterprise. The theory, made inclusive by this process, provides a more comprehensive understanding of creative phenomena.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'citizens' and 'citizenship' debates: 'vernacular citizenship' and contemporary Australian politics and society</field><field name="creator">Maher, Simon</field><field name="description">'Citizens' and 'citizenship' have become 'buzz words' in contemporary times. Within Australian academia the subjects have attracted an unprecedented level of interest. Typically the focus is on 'formal' definitions and 'official' forms of citizenship found within Government legislation. This focus is problematic because it is possible that it overlooks the existence of 'informal' and 'unofficial' understandings of citizenship. This thesis challenges the approaches that concentrate on 'official' versions of citizenship. It argues that an 'informal' understanding of citizenship has developed in the minds of the Australian community. This citizenship consists of a range of 'popular' and 'informal' ideas that comprise what might be called, 'vernacular citizenship'. It argues that they have developed from the mid to late 1840s, and continued their influence into the Federation era. This thesis analyses these 'popular' ideas which appeared in a variety of discourses in colonial and early Federation Australia, drawing upon publications such as the Citizen and the People's Advocate, as well as the speeches of politicians such as Daniel Deniehy, and the textual works of W.G. Spence and Joseph Furphy. It argues that these sources carried a collection of 'citizenship' ideas sharing a thematic compatibility. This bundle of 'common ideas' provided the foundation for the understanding of 'vernacular citizenship' to develop, playing an instrumental role in shaping the ways that political matters have been imagined in Australia. As well, the thesis explores the intellectual ancestry of these ideas, and explains why they have proved influential in shaping a 'popular' understanding of citizenship in Australian history. In presenting this case, it examines the historical background of the citizenship debates, as well as analysing contemporary discussions, thereby providing a means for understanding the full intellectual legacy of the citizenship debates and their implications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurotransmitter receptor binding in the posterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia and in the phencyclidine mouse model: an exploration of the NMDA hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Newell, Kelly</field><field name="description">Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with no clear cause. Recent evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction may underlie the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) has been shown to be the most susceptible brain region to damage caused by NMDA hypofunction in rodents. This suggests that the PCC may play an important role in schizophrenia pathology. However, studies examining neurotransmitter balance in the PCC in schizophrenia have until now been neglected. Furthermore, the long-term consequences of NMDA hypofunction on neurotransmitter balance in animal models have not been studied. The aims of this study were to investigate neurotransmitter receptor binding profiles in the PCC in schizophrenia, while also examining the effects of chronic phencyclidine (PCP; an NMDA antagonist) treatment on neurotransmitter receptor binding in mouse brain in the long-term following treatment. To achieve these aims, the study was divided into two parts. In experimental part A, PCC sections from 10 schizophrenia and 11 control subjects matched for age, gender and post-mortem interval were obtained from the Tissue Resource Center, Sydney. Using quantitative autoradiography, the density of several neurotransmitter receptors was examined. The results demonstrated specific alterations in neurotransmitter receptors in the PCC in schizophrenia. Specifically, increased NMDA, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor density was found in this region, along with reduced muscarinic 1/4 (M1/4) and serotonin 2A (5-hydroxy-tryptamine, 5HT2A) receptor density. No changes were found in &#65533;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA), kainate or M2/4 receptor density in the PCC in schizophrenia subjects compared to controls. These Kelly Newell Page 9 2007 results have shown for the first time that there are specific neurotransmitter imbalances in this region, and it is possible that these changes stem from NMDA hypofunction. In experimental part B, mice were treated chronically (14 days) with PCP. Using quantitative autoradiography the density of several receptors was examined in the short (1hr and 24hr) and long-term (14 days) following chronic PCP treatment. In addition, clozapine and haloperidol were tested for their ability to prevent the PCP-induced alterations in neurotransmitter receptor density. The results showed opposing effects of PCP treatment on neurotransmitter receptor density in the short compared to the longterm. While there were limited increases in NMDA receptor density in the short-term, there were widespread reductions in NMDA receptor density in the long-term following chronic PCP treatment. Muscarinic M1/4 receptor binding, which was increased in the short-term, showed reductions in the long-term in the limbic system, caudate-putamen and cortex, but not in the thalamus in which no change was found. Clozapine and haloperidol treatments were both unable to prevent the PCP-induced long-term changes in receptor density. In conclusion, this study has provided new information regarding neurotransmitter alterations in the PCC in schizophrenia and in mouse brain in the longterm following chronic PCP treatment. These findings may assist not only in understanding the pathology of schizophrenia, but also for designing new pharmacological treatments for this disease.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translocation of the Eastern Bristlebird and factors associated with a successful program</field><field name="creator">Bain, David</field><field name="description">In the ongoing concern for the conservation of biodiversity around the globe, intensive, hands-on management of threatened species is becoming commonplace. The translocation of organisms to establish, re-establish or augment populations is one of the intensive strategies being used. This thesis explores the contemporary use of translocation in conservation, with a focus on the reintroduction of the Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus) as a case study. Translocation can be defined as the movement of living organisms from one area to free release in another. It is becoming increasingly common in the conservation of threatened species of a range of taxa around the world. Translocations have generally suffered from high failure rates, which have been mainly attributed to low habitat quality of the release site, a small number of individuals released, ignoring species-specific behaviours, poor management of the original threats to the species and stochastic environmental events. Aspects that have been associated with success include high habitat quality of the release site, reintroduction into part of the former range of the species, large number of individuals released and the use of a wild source population. Recent reviews have identified five key aspects of translocation projects that are required for a well-formed translocation program. These are the completion of a feasibility analysis, the use of criteria by which to assess success, the inclusion of experimental designs, financial accountability, and the effective communication of outcomes. The bristlebird is an endangered Australian passerine. It is a small cover-dependent, semi-flightless bird that is restricted to a few isolated populations over a large geographic range. It is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, inappropriate fire regimes and introduced predators. Reintroduction was identified by the National Recovery Team as a potential management strategy for the conservation of this bird. This reintroduction program was established with the following aims: Successfully translocate the bristlebird; investigate the post-release dispersal of reintroduced birds; monitor the impact of removing birds from a population. To critically assess the effectiveness of the reintroduction program, seventeen criteria were established prior to commencement. The criteria were developed to be adaptable to a range of species or projects using a timescale that is measured in generation time rather than a set unit such as years. At the time of writing, the reintroduction was a resounding success. All criteria within the first four years were reached. Overall 13 of the 17 criteria have been achieved, including breeding being recorded in the reintroduced population and complete recovery of the source population following the removals. The costs of the reintroduction program were analysed against other conservation options for the bristlebird. The analysis revealed that this reintroduction was much cheaper than many other translocation programs. It was also the cheapest option reviewed to potentially expand the area of occupancy of the bristlebird around Jervis Bay. Two main study areas were established in the Jervis Bay region, NSW; one in the vicinity of the proposed source population at Booderee National Park and NSW Jervis Bay National Park and the other at the proposed release environment at Beecroft Peninsula. Over three years (2003 &#65533; 2005), fifty-one bristlebirds were caught using mist nets and 50 were transported to the release location and immediately released. All bristlebirds were banded, measured, had pin feathers collected for DNA analysis and radio transmitter attached before release. In the release environment, reintroduced birds were radio-tracked for up to 34 days after release, to allow estimation of initial dispersal distances and mortality. Beyond this, transect surveys and targeted call playback were used to monitor the reintroduced population once a year. In the reintroduced population, male bristlebirds dispersed further and moved more than females. Released bristlebirds did not disperse away from previously released conspecifics and settled quickly in nearby habitat. The translocated bristlebirds moved over much greater areas than bristlebirds in their native habitat; one bird dispersed over 4 km from the release location. During this monitoring, it was shown that bristlebirds can disperse a long way through continuous habitat, although they appear to prefer to settle in proximity to other bristlebirds. This has the potential to exacerbate the effects of habitat fragmentation as bristlebirds may not colonise nearby or tenuously connected habitat if there is a lack of conspecifics to enhance settlement. Two monitoring sites were established in the source population, one where removals were to take place and another as a control to assess the impact of the removals on the population. The removal of 51 bristlebirds over three years from a single area in the source population had no detectable impact. Individuals that were removed appeared to have been replaced within six months of their removal. The origin of the replacement bristlebirds was unknown but the quick recovery was suggested to be a result of a surplus of non-calling or non-territorial birds within the population, perhaps combined with some juvenile dispersal. Such a surplus may be a mechanism for population persistence in an unpredictable environment or a result of insufficient suitable habitat for population expansion. During the reintroduction, a wildfire burned a large proportion of bristlebird habitat in the location of the source population at Jervis Bay. The bristlebird has been described as firesensitive, with fire implicated in the decline of the species. The frequency of occurrence of bristlebirds was investigated in the second week after the fire in a range of sites varying in fire intensity. Bristlebirds were found in burned habitats but were more common in the less intensively burnt sites than in the more intensely burnt sites. Bristlebirds had been surveyed along transects in this area 2 months prior to this fire and were surveyed again 1, 9 and 13 months post-fire. Bristlebird numbers decreased in burnt areas after the fire and increased in unburnt areas. This pattern was evident for up to 9 months post-fire after which bristlebird numbers returned towards pre-fire levels in both burnt and unburnt vegetation. This is in contrast to some previous research on bristlebirds and fire. It is suggested that bristlebirds avoided the fire by moving to unburnt areas. By the onset of the next breeding season, displaced bristlebirds were returning to pre-fire home ranges. It is speculated that the apparent lack of impact from this fire on bristlebirds was due to the close proximity of unburnt habitat and other refuges. The dispersal of juveniles and non-territory holding floaters from unburnt habitat combined with feral predator control probably contributed to the observed response, although these were not tested. It is suggested that the response of bristlebirds and presumably other birds to fire is strongly context-dependant and that fire management and bristlebird conservation may not be mutually exclusive. Over fifty percent of bird species are sexually monomorphic and the bristlebird was previously considered to be part of this majority. I measured morphological characteristics on live and preserved bristlebirds, with sex determined genetically for live individuals using a common molecular technique, to test this suggestion. Males were significantly heavier, had larger heads, longer wings and longer tails than females. Univariate sexing criteria were developed based on the differences between males and females in two of these measures, weight and head-bill length and these measures were used to sex fifteen additional birds for which sex had been determined genetically. A discriminant function was also derived from the two characters. When the discriminant function was used in conjunction with the sexing criteria, 80 % of results agreed with molecular results, 7 % disagreed and 13 % were inconclusive. I speculate that this inaccuracy was due to juvenile males and the time of year of trapping, but the technique can be used to sex an individual in the hand with 80% accuracy, and can therefore provide a relatively quick and inexpensive method to investigate sex ratios in bristlebird populations and aid in the selection of individuals during further translocation projects. Translocation can be a useful tool in conservation if planned and funded well and the outcomes published for the dissemination of information. This reintroduction has been a success, with bristlebirds surviving and breeding in the release environment. This has expanded the area of occupancy for the bristlebird and helped to reduce threats to the species from stochastic events such as fire. Using experimental techniques, new aspects of bristlebird behaviour and population dynamics have been described, along with implications for the future management of the species.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dynamics of financial reporting practice in an Indonesian insurance company: a reflection of Javanese views of an ethical social relationship</field><field name="creator">Chariri, Anis</field><field name="description">This study is an ethnographic case study conducted in an Indonesian insurance company. The aim of the study is to understand the dynamics of financial reporting practice in the company. Ontologically, this study is built on a belief that financial reporting practice is a socially constructed reality. It is an institutional and political practice. As a socially constructed reality, such a practice involves an interaction among social actors, and between organisational actors and the institutional and cultural environment in which the company operates. The main research question of this study is why and how the company commits to quality financial reporting practice. This study reveals that the company is committed to quality financial reporting because such reporting can be used to gain legitimacy and to maintain social harmony. The company conducts itself in this way is because it reflects Javanese culture, a dominant culture in Indonesia. Hence, financial reporting can be designed by a powerful actor so as to construct a rhetorical story about the company's actions by claiming that it complies with socially imposed beliefs, norms and values about how the company should act. Furthermore, this study concludes that the way the actors in the company construct financial reporting practice is influenced by its organisational culture. The organisational culture of the company, which reflects Javanese culture, is able to shape the behaviour of its actors from the top level to lower levels to conduct ethical and transparent business practice. This culture also influences the way the actors respond to external pressures in regard to financial reporting practice. In addition, this study concludes that the exercise of power and leadership in the company determines the construction of financial reporting practice. The Javanese philosophy of power and leadership has shaped such exercise of power and leadership. Leaders of the company have been able to show themselves as exemplary models for their subordinates (ing ngarso sung tulodo), as individuals who are able to empower subordinates (ing madyo mangun karso), and have a sense of responsibility to their subordinates (tut wuri handayani). Finally, regardless of how beliefs, values and norms are institutionalised in the company to shape individual's behaviour, to influence the exercise of power and leadership, and then to socially construct financial reporting practice, this study reveals that financial reporting practice of the company is a socially dynamic process. It reflects the Javanese ideas on an ethical social relationship. Financial reporting practice in the company supports a claim that accounting is a social science. It is not value free, but a socially constructed reality.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conducting assessment online: educational developers' perspectives</field><field name="creator">Donnan, Peter Anthony</field><field name="description">This study investigated educational developers' perspectives on the conduct of assessment in Australian universities when online components were introduced into courses or subjects. To advance the inquiry, four research questions were developed that focussed on: the characteristics of educational developers that influenced the assessment advice they provided to academics; significant influences upon educational developers' thinking about assessment; critical assessment issues they identified when online components were introduced; and how to represent their thinking about assessment when it was conducted partially or fully online. The method of research was located within a qualitative, interpretive paradigm based on multiple case studies associated with the six participants who were employed in different Australian universities. Data collection involved three interviews with each participant, conducted in three consecutive semesters between June 2004 and July 2005. Data were digitally recorded during each interview, transcribed and then electronically imported into the qualitative software program Nvivo. Techniques of qualitative analysis were used to identify, describe and interpret critical components in participants' thinking about forms of assessment they were encountering online. The main conclusions of the inquiry were that (1) although the characteristics of educational developers in the sample group were described, their relevance became more apparent within the larger university contexts in which they worked; (2) significant influences upon educational developers occurred at an individual, as well as an institutional level and these were represented in a model that encapsulated key components in respondents' perspectives; (3) critical issues identified by respondents revolved around the difficulties of establishing the identity of online students, how to assess online discussions appropriately, use of the term 'interactivity', the value of online quizzes, determining transparent criteria for assessing online group work, embedding generic attributes in online assessment, criterion-referenced assessment, assessing international students online and the impact of university assessment policy; and (4) educational developers' perspectives on assessment were represented in three models: assessment online in traditional campuses, assessment online with a supported model in traditional campuses and a strategic, off-campus/off-shore model for assessment conducted online. The most significant finding from a theoretical perspective was in relation to the term e-assessment or online assessment. Despite widespread usage of the term in the literature on assessment, respondents did not recognise e-assessment as a separate category of assessment. Assessment that was conducted in an online environment was conceptualised by educational developers in the same way as assessment in face-to-face settings, or assessment conducted in print, or any other mode. After the primary learning and assessment issues had been resolved, however, a secondary consideration was how to design assessment most efficiently for the online environment to optimise the enabling features of the technologies and the learning affordances they offered. It was only in this context that the term e-assessment was significant.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic multimedia content access in a ubiquitous and distributed computing environment</field><field name="creator">Rong, Letian</field><field name="description">Ubiquitous computing is the concept of embedding many heterogeneous devices within our everyday environment in such a way that they operate seamlessly and become transparent to the person using them. It covers a wide range of applications and services, but of particular interest is multimedia resource adaptation which involves customization and dynamic adaptation of resources according to usage environments and user preferences; this aims to provide consumers with transparent access. This thesis proposes a content negotiation architecture for dynamic adaptation of multimedia content according to usage environment attributes. The architecture shields users from complex configuration details related to the adaptation of multimedia content, while guiding them through user related choices. The architecture also dynamically updates the multimedia content during transmission and consumption when related usage environment attributes are changed. The content negotiation mechanism in the proposed architecture is then extended and deployed in a mobile computing environment to accommodate transfer of multimedia content application session state between devices in a seamless manner. An application session transfer architecture which allows sessions to be directed, stored and transferred through an intermediary session server is proposed. The thesis also considers the foregoing work on the adaptation of multimedia resources applied to sharing in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. It proposes a super peer based dynamic resource adaptation architecture which employs 'pull' and 'push' two-stage adaptation approach. This guides users through resource search and configuration details without exposing them to unnecessary technical details; the result is that requested content is transparently adapted to heterogeneous terminal devices. Two separate, but related, modifications are proposed to further improve the performance of the proposed P2P architecture. Firstly, peers are clustered according to registered geographic location information and secondly, based on that registered location information, a locality-based service is introduced which allows users to search services according to their geographic locations. The latter encourages service providers to increase the uptime of their devices and hence provide spare computing power for active adaptation of resources for low-end peers. Resource replication is an important aspect of a P2P system and an adaptive resource replication strategy based on the proposed P2P architecture is presented. It uses resource request rate as the metric to trigger the resource replication process, and proportionally replicates multimedia resources into various configuration states according to the properties of peers and the size of peer clusters. Also, the strategy uses peer related information stored on super peers to determine which peers should be selected to perform adaptive replications and where the resulting replicas should be stored. The proposed adaptive replication strategy demonstrates that the network delays are reduced while resource hit rate is increased in comparison to other replication strategies. Investigation of the deployment of a BitTorrent (BT) - like approach in the proposed P2P resource adaptation architecture is also considered in this thesis. In addition, the architecture's peer selection strategy is adopted and evaluated as a way to enhance the peer selection process in BT. The strategy uses super peers as trackers to intelligently select peers according to their capabilities and shared resource segments and overcome the scalability issue of existing BT implementation. The proposed selection strategy reduces average access time and increases download speed when compared with the existing BT peer selection process with randomly selected peers. Also, the deployment of BT in the proposed P2P architecture shows that it greatly reduces the congested download problem which was previously reported.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality assurance in Australian universities: a study of quality assurance in undergraduate education at University of Culture in 2005</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Huai Nathan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated and described the application of quality assurance in an Australian university. The research explored the following questions: How is quality assurance understood at University of Culture (UOC)? How is quality assurance developed at UOC? What are the criteria for quality assurance at UOC, and How is quality assessed and evaluated at UOC? The research focused on how quality assurance was managed in undergraduate education at the University of Culture in 2005. This study inquired into the experience of quality assurance in an Australian university through three levels: Government policy, university policy and faculty practices. The research used a qualitative research methodology comprising of interviews, literature and documentary review to develop a case study (Denzin, 1989; Yin, 2003; Jupp, 1996). This study found that the University of Culture had a planned approach to quality assurance and a comprehensive set of processes that were driven through the Quality Cycle of the University. While the University and faculty selected for the case study were recognized as having high quality outcomes, there were varying perceptions about quality assurance between administrators and academics. The study also found that: (1) Traditional collegial and administrative methods in higher education have been supplanted by managerial approaches to leadership in higher education, and this influences the traditional culture of university. (2) There are divergent and opposing views on quality in the university community. The administrators thought quality assurance was necessary and relevant to the university's mission while the academics saw it as a cumbersome process and lacking relevance to their roles. (3) There was a varying perception of the use of the 'Quality Cycle' across the University of Culture. Knowledge of and the use of the 'Quality Cycle' varied at the grassroots level of the University. (4) Performance indicators were used as the criteria of quality assurance to enable benchmarking and comparisons between the universities. However, evidence from this study suggests that these indicators are not considered in the teaching process and the design of learning experiences, and tend to be seen as a tool for management rather than as guides for good practice. (5) Academics saw quality systems as unnecessarily onerous and bureaucratic and had a preference of methods that favored self-assessment, self-management of quality and course reviews at a faculty level rather than external reviews. This study confirms a polarization of opinions on the value of quality assurance and its relevance in university teaching and learning. The research highlights the differential impressions of quality across the university community and the need for alternative strategies that build on the actual work practices of academics. The study proposes that more collaborative and inclusive ways of developing quality assurance are required if they are to change the practices of academics.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impulse control systems for servomechanisms with nonlinear friction</field><field name="creator">Van Duin, Stephen</field><field name="description">At low velocities, friction is highly non linear and difficult to control. In practical mechanisms, friction may also be position dependent and highly variable. This can lead to tracking errors, limit cycles, and a phenomenon referred to as 'stick-slip', when a periodic cycle of alternating motion and rest, limits the mechanism's velocity and position accuracy. Impulse control is a friction compensator that does not require an accurate friction model. It achieves precise motion of a servomechanism by applying small impacts which overcome static friction with a controlled breakaway. The size of the impact and its duration determine how much the mechanism moves. By controlling the pulse, the positional accuracy of the mechanism can be improved. The work presented in this thesis results in new impulse controllers which: 1) improve the precision of a servomechanism without mechanical modification for the tasks of position pointing and low speed position tracking; 2) eliminate phenomena such as stick-slip, quadrant glitch, and limit cycling; 3) minimise system vibration and low speed position tracking ripple. The new controllers are tested by simulations, and experimentally verified on two different mechanical systems. One of these is a test bed built specifically for friction control experiments, and the other is a SCARA robot manipulator.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraint-based &amp; agent-based requirements engineering</field><field name="creator">Guan, Ying</field><field name="description">Non-functional requirements represent a critical and difficult problem in requirement engineering, but are often ignored. Usually, these are articulated as statements of objectives, as opposed to propositional assertions. A key challenge in dealing with objectives is that there is no obvious means of deciding when they are satisfied. In effect, these objectives are never fully satisfied, but satisficed to varying degrees. In evaluating alternative design decisions, we need to trade-off varying degrees of satisfaction of potentially mutually contradictory non-functional requirements. One key contribution of this work is the use of the hierarchical constraint logic programming framework in dealing with non-functional requirements. We show how NFRs can be formulated as soft constraints and how the machinery associated with constraint hierarchies can be used to evaluate the alternative trade-offs involved in seeking to satisfy a set of non-functional requirements that might pull in different directions. We apply also this approach to the problem of reasoning about web service selection and composition, and establish that significant value can be derived from such an exercise. Our second contribution is to develop an approach to executing high-level requirements models represented in the i* agent-oriented conceptual modeling language. We achieve this by translating these into sets of interacting agents implemented in the 3APL language. This approach enables us to analyze early phase system models by performing rule-/consistency-checking at higher-levels of abstraction. We show how this approach finds special application in the analysis of high-level models of service oriented architectures. The overarching project within which this research has been conducted seeks to bring to bear the full power of hierarchical constraint logic programming to requirements engineering problems. That this is a feasible exercise is clear from the close connections between logic programming and the style of agent programming explored here, as well as the connections between non-functional requirements and hierarchical representations of soft constraints that we have established in this thesis. The full project is beyond the scope of this Masters dissertation, but the research presented here may be viewed as laying the groundwork for this exercise.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Textual migrations: South Asian-Australian fiction</field><field name="creator">Athique, Tamara Mabbott</field><field name="description">This thesis responds to gaps in the scholarship of 'minority literatures' and makes a new contribution to diversifying the field of literary criticism. Given the prominence of South Asian diasporic fiction overseas, the study of South Asian-Australian fiction is now overdue. Given the growing recognition of multicultural and Asian-Australian literatures, the study of South Asian-Australian cultural production now requires attention. Working from the premise that a fictional text is a storytelling device open to a number of interpretations and a commodity with a degree of cultural capital, this thesis examines the tactics employed in and around selected works of fiction. Literary texts are marked by the politics publishing and academic theory. This thesis examines some of the 'invisible layers of intervention' that shape cultural production by indicating the placement of South Asian-Australian fiction within overlapping sets of academic, commercial and policy environments (Apter, 2001: 4). Having affirmed the importance of bringing a relatively invisible area of study into view, this thesis also considers the productive limits and limitations of literary categorisation. To this end, it draws on interviews with a number of writers who speak about their (self)-positioning. It remains crucial to consider the narrative detail of South Asian-Australian fiction: what types of stories do South Asian-Australian writers choose to tell and how do they craft them, what are the effects of such narratives and how are their complex cultural locations conveyed? The majority of this thesis is concerned with fleshing out these questions through detailed textual analysis that focuses on the w/rites of passage arising from the act of migration. Testing the utility of concepts drawn from postcolonial studies, theories of diaspora and critical multiculturalism, this thesis argues for an integrated theoretical approach to a set of texts that operate across local, national and transnational literary contexts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-commerce adoption by small medium enterprises: rural and regional general practices</field><field name="creator">Ramu, Sangeetha</field><field name="description">There is a crisis in healthcare provision in remote and rural locations, as more and more GPs are leaving the countryside for positions in metropolitan centres. E-commerce may help to overcome the lack of services and remoteness of a country practice. But rural and regional GPs are not adopting E-Commerce at the same rate as other Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This study aims to answer the question: What are the major issues faced by rural and regional General Practice in adopting E-commerce? The study presents the results of a survey of E-commerce adoption by GPs in a rural location (South East NSW) and a regional location (The Illawarra region of NSW). The survey gathers data on the business characteristics of the GPs and their perception of the factors influencing E-commerce adoption and the benefits and disadvantages of E-commerce adoption. Statistical analysis of the results has confirmed some of the trends found in the literature but, more interestingly, our analysis also challenges some of the most widely observed trends. Overall, the results show that rural and regional GPs (SMEs) perceive E-commerce adoption differently to their metropolitan counterparts. In addition, there are differences in the perception of E-commerce adoption by service-oriented SMEs (GPs) compared to other industry sectors, such as manufacturing, retail etc.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-agent based modeling and analysis of collaboration strategies in supply chain</field><field name="creator">Li, Xin</field><field name="description">A supply chain is a worldwide network of suppliers, factories, warehouses, distribution centers and retailers through which raw materials are acquired, transformed and delivered to customers. Modern supply chain management is moving away from vertically integrated companies that control all aspects of production and distribution toward networks of independent suppliers and distributors. Nowadays, supply chain collaboration has become the cornerstone of high performance in supply chain management. A key step in this collaboration process is to share information among the supply chain partners. However, current supply chain collaboration mainly focuses on the collaboration between two companies in a supply chain instead of in the whole system due to the limitation of the current modeling method and capabilities of current information systems. The multi-agent approach is a promising modeling method that can be used to design and develop supply chain management system to facilitate supply chain system-wide collaborative management. The aim is to investigate information sharing as a basic supply chain collaboration strategy through the application of the multi-agent approach to model and simulate the supply chain. This research presents a proposed conceptual framework of multi-agent based collaborative supply chain management system. The framework consists of four types of agents that include function, communication, coordination, and monitoring agents. The proposed framework illustrates the application of multi-agent techniques to integrate disparate supply chain information systems, to facilitate information sharing in the supply network, to support collaborative supply chain planning and to coordinate problem solving. A multi-agent based supply chain prototype is developed to investigate the impacts of information sharing on supply chain performance. Four scenarios have been investigated to measure the performance of both the inventory cost and customer service levels. The simulation results show that information sharing as a basic supply chain collaboration strategy can reduce the bullwhip effect and result in lower amounts of the inventory holding, but it leads to higher stock-outs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adaptive serializable snapshot isolation protocol for managing database transactions</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yang</field><field name="description">In this thesis, concept of database concurrency control, computational models of database transaction, the correct criterias of concurrent execution of transactions and concur- rency control algorithms such as two phase locking, serialization graph testing, Snap- shot Isolation are reviewed.

Of several incidents involving asylum seekers during the campaign, two have become essential to the election narrative: the so-called children overboard and SIEV X incidents. Although both incidents involved asylum seekers, they were also quite different. During children overboard, the Government was very quick to inform the public of what occurred, although this was later proven wrong, whereas the Government did not wish to publicise the deaths of 353 asylum seekers onboard SIEV X. Most Australians are now well aware of the truth behind children overboard, but the controversy surrounding SIEV X is still relatively unknown. Both cases illustrate that the Australian Government was able to minimise public outrage over its actions - actions which, according to a number of people, should have caused mass outrage. The central aim of this thesis is therefore to analyse how the Government managed to prevent outrage over its actions. One method for analysing how those in power, such as governments, inhibit outrage is the backfire model. The backfire model builds on the concept of 'political jiu-jitsu' and classifies Government actions into five methods: cover-up; devaluation of the target; reinterpretation of the event; using official channels; and intimidation and bribery. Extensive evidence is presented showing that in both cases, children overboard and SIEV X, the Government implemented all five methods. Recognising when a government attempts to implement one of the methods allows activists to execute their own counter-strategies, and in doing so challenge the government's authority and bring about positive social change.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fire response and seedling emergence patterns of Leucopogon (Epacridaceae) in South-Eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Mark</field><field name="description">There is a lack of understanding of the ecology of many Australian plant species. In fire prone habitat, natural fire regimes have shaped the evolution, and subsequently the demography and life history traits, of the associated flora. Critical life history stages, like germination and recruitment, are often linked to fire in species that occur in fireprone habitats. Knowledge of plant demography in relation to fire is important, particularly for threatened species. Management decisions are based on understanding the effect of factors such as fire frequency and season of bum and ensuring that the fire regimes implemented do not have a negative impact on the vegetation community. The Epacridaceae are a large family of plants confined mainly to Australasia. Although common and widespread in fire-prone systems, epacrid ecology is poorly understood. Leucopogon is the largest genus within the Epacridaceae. The aims of this study were designed to improve the understanding of the demographic processes of Leucopogon in relation to fire. I addressed these aims by focussing on the threatened species L. exolasius. and some common congeners, L. setiger, L. esquamatus and L. ericoides, in the fire-prone vegetation of the Sydney region in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, the questions asked were: (i ) What is the fire response of established plants? (ii) Is there a delayed or seasonal component to seedling emergence? (iii) Are germination cues linked to the passage of fire? Fire response and seedling emergence patterns were compared between species. Data were collected after four fire events between August 1999 and September 2002. To determine fire response of the four study species, individuals were tagged and measured, then subsequently burned. Survivorship was monitored post-fire for up to 12 months. All four study species were fire sensitive (classified as mortality after 100% leaf scorch). However, some plants survived in areas that remained unburnt after the low intensity bums. The proportion of established plants that survived was therefore dependent on fire patchiness. Topography, such as rocky outcrops, contributes to patchy fuel conditions and represents a mechanism for adult plant survival. This finding supports some studies that suggest that rare species, particularly obligate seeders, are concentrated in parts of the landscape where fires are less frequent. The rare species, L. exolasius, occurs almost exclusively on rocky sandstone riparian hillsides where some individuals are likely to remain unburnt during low intensity burns. In areas like the Sydney region, where large wildfires are a common event, recruitment from the seed bank would still be essential for the long term persistence of a species. In the event of two fires occurring in quick succession, a dormant seed bank could represent a buffer to population decline. The role of fire on germination cues and seedling emergence was examined in three of the species (L. ericoides excluded) by monitoring the numbers of newly emerged Leucopogon seedlings over time. Permanent quadrats were established under mature plant canopies. After fire, quadrats were monitored approximately every three months, and the number of seedlings counted. Quadrats were also established in unburnt L. exolasius and L. esquamatus habitats. All three Leucopogon species displayed a flush of seedling emergence after fire. Time elapsed until the onset of emergence differed between fires but not between Leucopogon species. Seedling emergence was restricted, in all Leucopogon species and after all fires, to the autumn (primarily late autumn) and winter period. The same seasonal pattern was found in unburnt habitat, though at much lower seedling densities. Emergence of Leucopogon species was delayed when compared with other fire sensitive species that co-occurred in the habitat These results indicate that the magnitude of delay to the onset of emergence is dependent upon the timing/season of the fire event. Also, combinations of fire-related and seasonal factors are necessary to maximise germination. A residual seed bank is left after fire, with germination timing still linked to season, and some inter-fire recruitment may occur. Seasonal dormancy in Leucopogon is likely to have developed over evolutionary time scales, and although fire has provided a strong influence on germination cues, variable rainfall patterns in the Sydney region may have allowed the persistence of seasonal dormancy traits. Results from the study were combined with data collected on species distribution, historical decline and threats, to make an assessment of the threatened species, L. exolasius, using a modified version of the IUCN Red List Criteria. The conclusion reached was the recommendation that the threat status of the species should be upgraded from vulnerable to endangered. This research has several implications for the management of L. exolasius. Firstly, hazard reduction bums should primarily be conducted outside of the late autumn/winter period in L. exolasius habitat, to reduce the magnitude of delay of emergence after fire. Secondly, inter-fire intervals of greater than 10 years are recommended for the longterm persistence of L. exolasius populations. Primary juvenile periods are thought to be relatively long, and this amount of time is required for individuals to mature and replenish the seed bank. Finally, the threat status of the species on the Schedules of the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995) and the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) should be changed from vulnerable to endangered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of science in the management of estuaries in southeastern Australia: the NSW experience</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Melissa Jane</field><field name="description">Calls to fill key data gaps and refine management and monitoring tools for estuaries are intensifying. This research investigates the extent to which estuarine science contributes toward policy development and implementation of management actions in southeastern (SE) Australia. This study benchmarks the current reliance on scientific information and expertise in formulating and implementing estuary policy. This involved an analysis of the function of estuary condition assessments in estuary management policy formulation and implementation. A lack of science and policy integration is revealed, leading to haphazard decision-making, with little overall consideration for ecological outcomes. Complex jurisdictional arrangements including the recent overlay of a fourth jurisdictional level, that of the regions, yet a lack of clear responsibility for data custodianship were identified as major failings of present arrangements. An absence of an appropriate framework to deal with specific management decisions, such as, the decision whether to artificially open an Intermittently Closed or Open Lake or Lagoon to the sea, reduces the effectiveness of the current system. There is a severe lack of long term, large scale monitoring of estuarine resources, including water quality and biodiversity. In terms of water quality, there is clearly strong community concern for estuarine water quality but the current water quality database is not adequate to ensure that ecosystems are meeting community expectations. Australia has international obligations to conserve biodiversity but the current deficiency in scientific information related to biodiversity means that we are unable to measure whether present management arrangements are adequately conserving estuarine biodiversity. It is a case of we cannot manage what we cannot measure. While there is enough information to start acting based on the existing scientific databases, decisions are generally made on short-term risk assessments of economic and social consequences, while disregarding natural processes and long-term sustainability of estuarine resources. To overcome these problems, recommendations are made toward the integration of scientific information into the estuary management process, including acceptance of the responsibility for long term monitoring by governments and how to improve communication between scientists and managers. The diverse abiotic and biotic characteristics, as well as the high environmental value of these systems, reinforce the need to tailor management decisions to the individual water body concerned.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of plant invaders and management techniques on native communities : ecological and social perspectives at regional and global levels</field><field name="creator">Mason, Tanya J</field><field name="description">Plant invasions of natural communities threaten biodiversity and ecosystem processes across many biomes and trophic levels. Understanding and managing invader impacts are therefore significant steps in achieving conservation. Both causes and management of invasion are dependent on human behaviour and ecologists must consider this human dimension in developing management protocols. While control of invaders is routine in many conservation reserves, assessment of ecological outcomes following control is rarely enacted. Management is itself a disturbance and the compounding effects of both invasion and management on biodiversity merit rigorous assessment. While species-level responses to plant invasion have been widely reported, functional group and seed bank responses to invasion and management are rarely investigated. Generalisations about invader impacts are urgently required for targeted restoration. In this thesis, I used qualitative review, field study and meta-analysis to address ecological, social and land management issues of invasion biology. Firstly, I reviewed policy instruments and asked: are government, land managers and the scientific community using available social levers to achieve optimal invader management? I found that while important policy principles have been developed, they require greater enactment. Release of significant funds will be required to resource long-term invader control and restoration activities. Education and voluntary incentives require a strong extension service to maintain involvement and standards of control. Rigorous monitoring systems are an under-utilised but important tool in achieving adaptive invader management. I then used the invasive shrub bitou bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, to analyse invasion and management impacts in coastal dune communities of eastern Australia. I compared the effects of intensive, manually-based invader control with those of extensive control (mainly herbicide spraying from aircraft) across fore dune communities. I examined one management regime, which was typically intensive, in hind dune communities. My main aim was to test the prediction that intensive methods would achieve better biodiversity outcomes than extensive approaches in fore dune communities. I found that extensive management created native species complements that diverged from non-invaded sites while intensive management approached non-invaded site conditions. However, intensively managed sites were also richer in other exotic species than extensively managed sites. Thus, while biodiversity outcomes were better under intensive management, the risk profile of such sites was increased by the greater array of exotics that could potentially replace the original invader. The positive effects of management evident on some fore dunes were not found in hind dunes, where managed sites had the highest exotic species richness and similar bitou bush seedling abundance as both non-invaded and bitou-invaded sites. Hind dune managed sites were also compositionally distinct from non-invaded sites. For all sites, even after intensive management, follow up control is required to avoid substitution of the primary invader by other aggressive invaders. In order to characterise invader impacts beyond species-level comparisons, I compared bitou bush impacts on vegetation structure, richness of both native and exotic growth forms and community variability in fore and hind dunes. I found that bitou bush impacts were context specific: in fore dune shrublands, functionally distinct graminoid, herb and climber rather than shrub growth forms had significantly reduced species richness following bitou bush invasion. However, in forested hind dunes, the functionally similar native shrub growth form had significantly reduced species richness following bitou invasion. Density of vegetation structure increased at the shrub level in both fore and hind dune bitou-invaded, relative to non-invaded communities. Fore dune ground-level vegetation density declined at bitou-invaded sites compared with noninvaded sites reflecting significant reductions in herb and graminoid species richness. Hind dune canopy-level vegetation density was reduced at bitou-invaded compared with non-invaded sites. Bitou bush invasion also affected fore dune community variability with significant increases in variability of species abundances observed in bitou-invaded compared with non-invaded sites. In contrast, there was similar variability among all hind dune sites. The results suggest that effects of bitou bush invasion are mediated by the vegetation community. In addition to standing vegetation dynamics, I investigated soil-stored seed banks affected by bitou bush invasion and management, to further elucidate levels of community resilience. While management of bitou bush may have reduced the density of bitou bush seeds in the soil, it did not reduce the richness of other exotic species. Native tree seed richness was significantly higher in seed banks of sparsely-invaded than either heavily-invaded or managed hind dune sites, perhaps indicating a permanent shift in community structure following invasion. However, remaining indices of native seed bank diversity were similar across all invasion categories, indicating that seed banks of many native species were unaffected by both invasion and management. While examination of seed banks is informative in assessing past and potential community dynamics, low similarity between the standing vegetation and seed bank at all sites indicated that many hind dune species had other storage or regeneration modes and seed banks cannot be relied upon for comprehensive dune restoration. Finally, I used meta-analysis to contextualise my field studies of bitou bush invasion using 20 international invasion studies. I hypothesised that plant invaders act as biotic filters and more strongly affect representation of some plant traits over others in the resident community. I analysed the effects of graminoid and woody invaders on species richness for native growth form, longevity, seed mass and flowering phenology traits. I found that graminoid invaders disproportionately affected species with graminoid and herbaceous growth forms, perennial strategies and small seed masses. Woody invaders disproportionately affected graminoid or shrub species and perennials. Woody invaders had a consistently greater negative effect on native species than graminoid invaders, perhaps due to pre-emption of light resources. In contrast, it made no difference to native richness as to whether species flowered at the same time as the invader, indicating little interaction between invader and native pollination dynamics. Plant invaders non-randomly affect resident species in turn changing community attributes. Current management of invaders may not re-instate pre-invasion conditions. Restoration is dependent on recognising the impacts of an invader and both supplementing native traits adversely affected by invasion and enacting long-term follow-up control of primary and secondary invaders.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing effective protected area networks - integration of the tropical cyclone disturbance regime in the Great Barrier Reef Representative Area Program : a GIS application</field><field name="creator">Debort, Sophie</field><field name="description">In recognition of the scenic, ecological, and scientific values of the marine environment, attempts at conservation are increasingly recognized. In a world progressively modified by human activities, the conservation of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystems goods and services to society. Unfamiliarity with large disturbances that rarely occur has resulted in the neglect of this kind of event in reserve management. Cyclones are extremely powerful events that can damage coastal and marine environments like coral reefs by generating large wave forces, sediment resuspension and subsequent smothering, influx of large volumes of freshwater and terrestrial sediment due to heavy rains, and winds and storm surge. For example, in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a lack of knowledge about large natural disturbances like cyclones and their effect on the marine environment has prevented managers of the Marine Park from explicitly considering such perturbations in planning. The goal of this study was to place what is known about widespread natural disturbances (tropical cyclones) into the context of marine reserve design requirements and management decision for the conservation of the GBR, Australia. To do so, the newly implemented Representative Area Program (RAP) of the GBR Marine Park (GBRMP) was evaluated against the recently characterised tropical cyclone disturbance regime across the region (Puotinen, 2005a). Recruitment to reefs by settlement of distant larvae via a series of short steps within and between reefs is a key process towards reef recovery. It was then assumed that the reefs that are highly protected (HPR) from human activities should also be relatively cyclone-free, to allow them to act as &#8216;sources&#8217; of larvae to enable recovery of less protected adjacent reefs after disturbances. The level of cyclone disturbances at HPR was characterised based on its frequency and timing, and its influence on connectivity between HPR (source) and non-HPR (sink) reefs across the GBR. Even though most HPRs have had time to recover fully between tropical cyclone events at least once over the last 35 years, they typically had a short time to recover between subsequent cyclone events (short recovery periods). Thus, they may not always be available as &#8216;sources&#8217; of larvae in a given year, which reduces the effective connectivity between sources and sink reefs in that cyclone disturbance regime. Under such scenario, the RAP may not adequately protect the GBR. This is the case because HPR (potentially representing the best source for support and replenishment of adjacent areas) have not been placed to ensure infrequent exposure to cyclone damage. Because reserves are usually meant to be permanent, their design must be effective even under conditions that may be very different from current conditions. In this context, it is important to consider the history of disturbance in a region as it may determine the level of complexity or fragility that this region can develop between disturbance events. The RAP was developed with the best information available at the time, but the characterisation of the GBR cyclone disturbance regime now available (Poutinen, 2005a) suggests that the timing of the most recent cyclone event is not typical of the 1969-2003 time series. Thus, an &#8216;insurance&#8217; factor based on Allison et al. (2003) was complied to identify how much additional reef area would need to be set aside to allow for the creation of a new framework accommodating the reality of cyclone disturbance in marine reserve planning. Overall, only for short recovery times (5-10 years) and ecosystem level connectivity between source and sink reefs can a sufficient additional insurance reserve be realistically set aside to provide a buffer against cyclone disturbance. One solution to this may be to create temporary dynamic reserves as needed after severe cyclones. The effectiveness of such measures over the long-term will depend not only on the occurrence and magnitude of other disturbances that may develop synergistically to create more dramatic effects on reefs but also on global climate change. Predicting effects of directional climate change will facilitate the evaluation of the long-term success of a reserve.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limits to revegetation of clay capped landfill sites by Australian native plants</field><field name="creator">Hannah, Eleanor Jane</field><field name="description">The revegetation of closed landfill sites is an important issue due to the large and increasing amount of land involved, and because the demand for that land, and its value, is constantly increasing. If successful revegetation is possible, then these degraded sites provide an excellent opportunity for the establishment of native plant communities in the middle of urban sprawl. Common problems identified with the revegetation of landfill sites have included the use of poor quality soils with low organic matter, low levels of available nutrients, the use of species not suited to the conditions, and landfill gas. The problems with the soils are compounded by compaction, resulting in low permeability and porosity, leading to very low available soil moisture. Little research, however, has been conducted on the revegetation of clay-capped landfill sites in Australia using Australian native plant species. The overall aim of the thesis was to test the survival and growth of indigenous plants at clay capped landfill sites. I used three landfill sites in western Sydney as case studies. Species that may be suited to the early revegetation of these sites were identified and information available on plant growth of these indigenous was found to be limited. So I initially surveyed the germination potential of a range of the target indigenous species with two pilot studies, one at Site 1 the other at Site 2. At both sites, very low germination rates (0% in 4 species, highest 4.1%) were observed, with the possible contributing factors being low rainfall and subsequent low soil moisture levels and herbivory of seeds and plants. In order to overcome the fragile germination and early seedling establishment phase, I conducted a planting trial at Sites 1 and 2 using Acacia linifolia, A. ulicifolia, Indigofera australis, Kennedia rubicunda and Lomandra longifolia. Survival rates from these experiments were also very low, with the main contributing factors inferred to be herbivory, and low soil moisture availability. Importantly, the most successful species in the planting trial was Lomandra longifolia, which had zero germination in the seeding trials. The role of soil moisture in limiting germination or seedling and plant survival was tested in two experiments: a glasshouse germination study; and field study, in which mulching and watering were manipulated. Germination in the glasshouse with daily watering was 10 times higher than that in the field (one-way ANOVA, Fx,y = 243; P &lt;0.0001) illustrating that low available soil moisture is a limiting factor in the germination of the tested species. In the field experiment, the addition of the equivalent of 10 mm of rain once a week in the field did not significantly increase germination or seedling survival over 1 year for any of the species tested. A thin layer of straw mulch, however, did result in higher germination and 1 year seedling survival for several species at one of the sites (ANOVA Hardenbergia violacea Fx,y = 3.64; P = 0.03 and Kennedia rubicunda Fx,y = 22.49; P &lt;0.0001). The role of herbivory and seed predation were tested in two other studies. Seed removal in May 1996 was not very high overall at either site, with just over 80% of seed remaining after 1 week. In February 1997, seed removal rates were higher with just 7.1% (Site 2) and 3.3% (Site 3) of seed remaining in the caches after 1 week. The higher seed removal in February was likely to be due to the time of year, with ants being more active in the warmer months. Several problems were encountered with the herbivory study: vandalism, the presence of domestic stock that was not anticipated; and a period of low rainfall. These three factors combined to result in very poor survival rates (11% after 4 months). I concluded that no one strategy or range of species could be identified for successfully revegetating landfill sites in the short term. However, herbivory, low soil moisture, seed predation, vandalism and ongoing site works, could all limit success in particular circumstances. As a consequence, adaptive management approaches will be needed in developing solutions to particular sites and to ensure new information can be incorporated into ongoing management of a restoration program and the development of a better general understanding about limiting factors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining the mechanism and functional consequences of PAI-2-mediated uPA/uPAR endocytosis</field><field name="creator">Croucher, David R</field><field name="description">Plasminogen is converted to its active form plasmin by two major serine proteases; the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). De-regulated plasmin formation is associated with tumour growth and progression. Whilst tPA is primarily involved in blot clot dissolution, uPA, along with its cell surface receptor uPAR, are commonly over-expressed at the leading edge of a tumour and by the tumour-associated stroma, contributing to plasmin formation, cell proliferation and migration. Soluble and receptor bound uPA is efficiently inhibited by two members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily; the plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 (PAI-1) and 2 (PAI-2) (Serpin E1 and B2 respectively). The purpose of this thesis was; (1) to examine the fate of cell surface bound PAI-2, a largely un-explored aspect of the plasminogen activation system, with particular focus on the possibility of the internalisation of uPA bound PAI-2; (2) to characterise the interaction between PAI-2, uPA:PAI-2 and any putative receptors involved in the internalisation of these proteins; and (3) to determine the functional consequences of the process of PAI-2 internalisation, in terms of regulation of uPA/uPAR levels and cell signaling responses. Confocal microscopy and a novel flow cytometry based internalisation assay were used to both visualise and measure the interaction of PAI-2 with human carcinoma cancer cell lines. This data provided definitive proof that uPA bound PAI-2 was internalised into the endosomes and lysosomes of these cells, mediated through an interaction with endocytosis receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. This finding may lead to the development of a more effective PAI-2 cancer therapeutic utilising the intracellular delivery of cytotoxins to cancer cells. Surface plasmon resonance and further applications of the flow cytometry based internalisation assay were used to investigate the interactions of uPA:PAI-2 with two receptors of the LDLR family. This lead to the characterisation of the interaction between uPA:PAI-2 and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLr). The biochemical analysis of these interactions, in comparison to that of uPA:PAI-1, led to the discovery of a novel difference in the kinetics and affinities of the interactions between uPA:PAI-1, uPA:PAI-2 and these receptors. Differing positive electrostatic potentials and conservation of a putative LDLR binding motif within helix D of these two serpins, specifically surrounding a conserved arginine residue, were implicated in the higher affinity of uPA:PAI-1 for these receptors. The consequences of this variation in receptor binding were revealed using MCF-7 breast cancer cells. As previously demonstrated, the binding of the high affinity helix D site in uPA:PAI-1 to VLDLr on MCF-7 cells resulted in the propagation of intracellular signaling events and cell proliferation. As uPA:PAI-2 does not contain this high affinity site, these cell signaling events were not induced upon uPA:PAI-2 binding to VLDLr, however the complex was still efficiently endocytosed. The data presented in this thesis therefore proposes a novel mechanism behind the disparity in patient prognosis associated with tumour expression of PAI-1 and PAI-2. The negative prognostic impact of PAI-1 may be mediated through the mitogenic effects of its high affinity LDLR binding site, whereas the positive prognostic impact of PAI-2 stems from its ability to efficiently inhibit and clear cell surface uPA without inducing the mitogenic effects associated with PAI-1.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blackfella armies - kastom and conflict in contemporary Melanesia 1994 - 2007</field><field name="creator">Bohane, Ben</field><field name="description">This dissertation accompanies photographs taken in my role as a photojournalist in the region under study. The photographs on CD are a visual narrative in their own right while serving as part of the overall text and they are referred to regularly throughout the dissertation. The past decade has seen a significant rise in armed conflict throughout the established nations of Melanesia, as well as in those still fighting for their independence. Thus some are wars of independence, others are civil wars, while others are about reclaiming traditional lands within an acknowledged nation state. These coups and conflicts have resulted in humanitarian crises*, the weakening of government authority and in several instances such as Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, the intervention of armed regional peacekeeping forces led by Australia. What is at the root of these conflicts? In conducting photojournalism, how can we better understand the conflicting forces prevalent within Melanesian societies? This thesis will argue that beyond the usual diagnosis of corruption, unemployment and poor governance, there is a powerful spiritual component at work - ie the role played by kastom and cult movements throughout the region. These movements were often the embryo for nationalism during colonial times and today they continue to play a significant role in their societies and can be seen as something of a weather-bell for the hopes and frustrations of island communities. They have been responsible for instigating conflict and equally have been instrumental in ending conflict and facilitating reconciliation. Traditionally, kastom and cult movements have either been ignored or actively suppressed by government authorities (white and black) and by the established churches. However these movements can also play a positive role in the development and stability of island communities. A better understanding and appreciation of these movements will add a critical analytical tool to journalists working within the region, who are often accused of superficial, *parachute* journalism. The use of sorcery is rarely reported within the mainstream press, yet it continues to have daily relevance for Pacific islanders regardless of whether they are at war or peace. A basic understanding of the role of kastom and cult movements will help reduce the chance of journalistic misrepresentation of big issues such as coupes in Fiji and civil war in the Solomon Islands. To better understand the socio-political landscape of Melanesia, and so to write more accurately on issues affecting the region, it is essential to come to terms with the spiritual world its peoples inhabit. To do this I am using a methodology incorporating large amounts of journalistic fieldwork (witnessing and documenting rituals and first hand interviews with spiritual leaders), with a study of previous academic work on the subject. This overall research process is best described as Participatory Action Research - a broad collection of scholarly activities involving community, solidarity, consultation and commitment. These were necessary to both my journalism in the first instance and in conducting research for this thesis. Participatory Action Research was able to identify any advantage and power between the researcher and the studied - a central issue to the notion of working with indigenous people, whether it be in journalism, ethnography, film-making, diplomacy or defense. The main case study for this thesis rests on Bougainville, charting the history of Christian, kastom and cult activity there over 100 years leading up to its war of independence from 1988- 1998, as well as following the evolution of these movements throughout the war, the role they played in ending the war and in facilitating a successful reconciliation process that has (so far) brought peace to the embattled island. One hundred and twenty images relating to various Christian, kastom, cult and militant groups throughout Melanesia and Australia are incorporated in the thesis in a CD sleeve, including a section entitled Big Men with portraits of various leaders.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion protection using conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Gustavsson, Jan Magnus</field><field name="description">Concern over the toxicity and environmental impact by use of chromate containing coating coatings has fuelled efforts to find suitable replacements. One class of materials considered as a potential replacement for chromate coatings are the intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP's). This thesis describes the synthesis and characterization of a range of ICP materials with emphasis on producing processable ICP and their use as corrosion protection coatings for aluminium alloy 2024-T3 and Zn-55%Al- hot dipped coated steel, two substrates that commonly employ chromate coatings for adequate protection. A general introduction to corrosion and ICP's are given in Chapter 1 with techniques employed to study corrosion inhibition detailed in Chapter 2. Processability of Polyaniline was afforded by making of composite material to produce Polyaniline-HSCA/Poly(butyl acrylate-vinyl acetate) copolymer (PAn/co-poly) possessing moderate conductivity and electroactivity (Chapter 3). Pan/co-poly was highly soluble and could be applied as a coating to AA2024-T3 by airbrushing. Polypyrrole was afforded processability by monomer substitution to produce soluble Poly(3-octylpyrrole). Material synthesis was optimised to produce a maximum conductitvity for the soluble ICP that could be applied to a metal surface by airbrushing or evaporative casting. Conductive, soluble P3OP was synthesised both through electrochemical and chemical synthesis P3OP route. Corrosion inhibition offered by ICP evaluated using Potentiodynamic polarisation and Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Chapter 4) suggests an interaction between the ICP coating and the underlying substrate. PAn/co-poly was observed to provide an anodic shift to the OCP of coated AA2024-T3. Increasing Rc and Rct during exposure suggested that the coating converted towards a less conductive form. Exposure of conductive P3OP-ClO4 coated AA2024-T3 also resulted in increasing Rct overtime, ascribed to the formation of protective oxide. Local corrosion behaviour within a coating defect was studied by SVET (Chapter 5). SVET demonstrated that PAn/co-poly accelerated corrosion within a defect without formation of protective oxide. Conductive fractions of P3OP exhibited decreasing oxidation within coating defect overtime suggesting the formation of an oxidation product that hinders further corrosion. Raman spectroscopy (Chapter 6) as well as visual observations (Chapter 4 and 5) suggest that oxidation of the substrate was promoted by the ICP that undergoes reduction. For P3OP this leads to lower corrosion current density within surface a defect suggesting that P3OP does protect against corrosion through anodic protection.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educating bodies to be good citizens: the politics and practices of physical education in Australia and France</field><field name="creator">Groom, Lyndal</field><field name="description">This thesis is a cross-cultural comparative analysis of the physical education taught in secondary schools in France and Australia. My study begins with an analysis of embodied citizenship. Embodied citizenship comprises both explicit and implicit forms of habitus as structured through government institutions and regulations, for example, the legal requirements of citizenship as well as the informal social constructs of citizenship such as belonging. While the formal rules of citizenship have been amended over the centuries to provide greater equality (for example between men and women), tacit and unspoken rules and beliefs and the marketplace maintain forms of exclusionary behaviour for citizens. This includes state instituted practices such as public commemorations, national and local celebrations and award ceremonies, particularly those related to the remembrance war and the founding of nation-states. The second half of this study takes this theoretical framework to examine the politics and practices of physical education in schools. Physical education is an example of a state-instituted practice designed to help develop 'good' citizens, obedient and efficient. In order to do this, a Foucauldian network of expertise and skills has emerged to 'regulate' the discipline of physical education and draws upon intercalated discourses of health, morality, sport, and physical activity. While the politics of physical education, in the shape of the school curriculum, espouse a doctrine of equality of citizens, the practices incorporate forms of differentiated embodied citizenship that continue to privilege and reward particular hegemonic characteristics. The value of cross-cultural analysis emerges with the comparison of political positioning of the French and NSW syllabi. As the later stages of my research shows, policy is one thing and classroom practices are often another. The personal engagement of teachers with discourses of physical culture is a major influence for implementing syllabi.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and ecology of diadromous fishes in south eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Miles, Nathan G</field><field name="description">Diadromous fishes are a frequent but poorly understood component of coastal riverine fish communities in Australia. Many of Australia&#8217;s coastal riverine fish, including diadromous species, have undergone declines in abundance and distribution since European settlement. Fish that were once plentiful are now generally rare or appear to be extinct in some catchments or parts of their range. However, as a group, diadromous fish species have complex lifecycles, the details of which have not been well investigated. The various environments and habitats used by diadromous fish are also under threat, through poor land practices, land reclamation and river regulation. The current study aimed to fulfil a number of gaps in the current knowledge of diadromous fishes in Australia. The primary objective was to examine the current distribution, abundance and biology of diadromous fish species of south eastern Australia.As information on diadromous fishes in Australia was limited, an extensive review of the literature has been conducted as a basis for identifying knowledge gaps. From this review, it was estimated that 33 Australian fish species display diadromous lifecycles, of which only seven have information available for most life stages (Lates calcarifer, Macquaria novemaculeata, Galaxias maculatus, G. brevipinnis, G. truttaceus, Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax). Diadromy in Australian fish species is dominated by amphidromy (45.5%) and catadromy (42.4%), with only a small proportion of the diadromous species anadromous (12.1%). The geographical distribution of diadromy in Australia showed that the highest species richness occurred in the north east and south east of the continent, with lowest species richness in the south west. Latitudinally, northern latitudes of Australia are dominated by amphidromy, the central latitudes by catadromy and the southern latitudes have relatively even numbers of all three diadromous types. The lack of information on diadromous fishes and the high level of environmental degradation and river regulation in south eastern Australia highlight the urgent need for further research on diadromous species in this region.Diadromous fishes use a range of marine and freshwater environments at different life history stages. As a result, a variety of fish sampling methods were trialled and their efficiency in catching a wide range of species and fish sizes in marine and freshwater environments was assessed. The examined methods included: seine net, scoop net, fyke net, plankton nets, light traps and fish traps. Each method proved useful for capturing certain fish species and fish sizes. Overall, the seine net caught the greatest number of individuals and species, and this method was also time efficient for catching and sorting the catch. As a result, seine nets were adopted for all of the larger scale studies that were conducted in the current research. The broadscale study (Chapter 4) conducted over a large spatial scale also incorporated scoop nets, bait traps and multi panel gill nets, as these provided a range of active and passive methods which allowed rapid assessment of fish at each site. The more detailed study (Chapter 5) aimed to examine a wide range of fish sizes and life stages over larger temporal scales, and used all the methods that were trialled in the pilot study, as the use of these methods ensured that the entire lifecycle of diadromous species could be sampled.The distribution and abundance patterns of diadromous and riverine fishes were investigated over large spatial scales, by sampling at 47 sites in 17 catchments between 2004 and 2005. A total of 13 269 fish from 31 species were recorded and these were dominated in number by native freshwater fishes (10 252 fish, 8 species), when compared with introduced freshwater fishes (1 570 fish, 3 species), marine fishes (777 fish, 10 species) and diadromous fishes (670 fish, 10 species). Although diadromous fish were only recorded in limited abundance, they were important in that they constituted: a large number of species to the assemblages; larger sized fish to the community; and, key species to reproductive, trophic and behavioural guilds. In particular, diadromous fish made up the majority of carnivorous species which feed on allochthonous inputs and they also contributed to herbivorous and omnivorous guilds. Multivariate analyses (MDS and ANOSIM) significantly delineated fish assemblages based on marine and coastal bioregions, river size, estuary type and river reach. SIMPER revealed that a range of freshwater, introduced, marine and diadromous fish contributed to these differences in the fish communities. Galaxias maculatus, Gobiomorphus australis, Potamalosa richmondia and M. novemaculeata were the diadromous species which most often contributed to these differences.The temporal and spatial variability of diadromous fish assemblages were examined in more detail in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers. Differences in fish assemblages were influenced spatially by the longitudinal gradients throughout the catchment and by the migrational patterns and recruitment of diadromous fishes. Temporal variation in diadromous fish assemblages were also complicated by the lifecycle of diadromous fishes as many species have migrating larvae, juveniles and/ or adults which mean they can be present in the stream throughout all seasons but in different life stages. As a result, diadromous fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers exhibited complex spatial and temporal patterns which reflected their lifecycles and migratory requirements. Longitudinal changes in diadromous fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven River were also influenced by the presence of Tallowa Dam. Fish communities below this structure were more similar to those further downstream, but diadromous fishes were also affected by cold water pollution below this structure. The abundance of diadromous fish were also negatively correlated with distance from the tidal limit, but were generally positively correlated with instream habitats such as woody debris and undercut bank.The migratory history of five species were examined through otolith microchemistry. In order to ensure that otolith Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca values in wild fish were the result of ambient salinities, a manipulative experiment was conducted. Fish were held in various salinities and temperatures for a period of up to 62 days. The resulting Sr:Ca values showed patterns which reflected that of the salinity regime. However, for some species the Ba:Ca values did not appear to reflect changes in salinity. Transects across otoliths from wild caught fish also revealed distinct variations in otolith Sr:Ca values, with patterns that indicated a diadromous lifecycle in freshwater mullet (Myxus petardi) and striped gudgeon (Gobiomorphus australis). Freshwater herring (Potamalosa richmondia), Cox&#8217;s gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii) and bullrout (Notesthes robusta) displayed less obvious patterns in Sr:Ca values, perhaps reflecting more complex patterns of movement between marine and freshwater environments. Although, some of these species were previously thought to be diadromous, the current study suggested that, for some species, the type of diadromy (or range of movements) may differ from those previously documented. The most important finding was the apparent amphidromous lifecycle of M. petardi, in at least for these populations from the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers.This research provided new information on the biology and status of a number of diadromous fish species of south eastern Australia. Of particular importance was the collection of new information about M. petardi and P. richmondia, including the capture of larvae and juveniles from brackish water. These data supported the diadromous lifecycles, which were indicated by otolith microchemistry. Age estimates confirmed longevity in P. richmondia (~10 years) and M. petardi (~5 years) and from the specimens of N. robusta that were examined it appears that they have longevity in excess of five years. This study also highlighted an apparent decline in distribution and abundance of Prototroctes maraena and Pseudaphritis urvillii on the NSW south coast, which may be a cause for concern. More research is required to determine the status and threats for these species, in particular.The current study has provided important new information about the distribution and abundance patterns, as well as the biology, for a number of diadromous species in this region. It has also highlighted the need for further research and management of this important group of fish.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some innovative numerical approaches for pricing American options</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jin</field><field name="description">With the well-known model of lognormal asset price, the option valuation prob- lems can be implemented by using the Black-Scholes partial differential equation approach. However, for American option pricing problems, it is hard to find an analytical formula due to the moving boundary feature [23]. This thesis presents two innovative numerical methods [38, 39] to value American put options in terms of solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation with a set of appropriate boundary conditions. The first method is the Laplace Transform Method, which extends the pseudo- steady-state approximation idea for the American option pricing problems in non- dividend yield case [35] to the one in constant dividend yield case. The approach transfers the original partial differential equations system to an ordinary differential equations system, to derive the solutions of the option prices and the optimal exercise boundary in the Laplace space respectively. After that, numerical inversions are performed to restore their corresponding values in the original time space. The second method promotes a new predictor-corrector idea that uses a hybrid finite difference scheme to tackle the nonlinear nature of American option pricing problems, which is explicitly exposed after applying the front-fixing technique [21] to the original Black-Scholes partial differential equation. The new predictor-corrector scheme implements the computation of the option prices and the optimal exercise boundary through solving a set of linearized difference equations at each time step, to achieve high computational effeciency and numerical accuracy. Through the comparison with Zhu's analytical solution [34], we found that, the Laplace Transform Method is highly effecient since numerical calculations are only iv performed for the inversion part, whereas the calculations of the Laplace transform are done analytically. Although the Laplace Transform Method slightly undervalues the optimal exercise boundary due to the pseudo-steady-state approximation intro- duced to allow the Laplace transform to be performed on the moving boundary. The loss of the accuracy in this regard is greatly compensated by its high compu- tational speed. For the second method, we have shown that the numerical results obtained from the predictor-corrector scheme converge uniformly to Zhu's exact op- timal exercise boundary and option values [34], provided a convergence criterion is imposed. Furthermore, the agreement between the numerical solutions from the second method, and those from the Grid Stretching Method [24] that is a fourth- order scheme for both the asset price and time discretizations, not only validates the second method once again but also demonstrates its accuracy in that a lower-order scheme has virtually achieved the same level of accuracy as a higher-order scheme does.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling nanostructures as nano-oscillators and for applications in nanomedicine</field><field name="creator">Hilder, Tamsyn A</field><field name="description">The advent of nanotechnology has been the catalyst for considerable advances in industries such as electronics and medicine. The unique physical properties ob- served at the nanoscale has driven numerous investigations into their properties and potential applications. This thesis investigates three aspects of nanotechnology, in particular an alternative formulation for determining the intermolecular force be- tween interacting molecules, nanostructures as nano-oscillators, and nanotubes for applications in nanomedicine. The intermolecular forces between two interacting nanostructures are typically obtained by either summing over all the individual atomic interactions in the dis- crete atom-atom formulation or by using a continuum approach, for which the atoms are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the surface of each molecule. The con- tinuum approach enables highly complicated molecular interactions to be modelled in much less time than the equivalent discrete atom-atom formulation, which can be extremely time consuming. However, a constraint on the continuum approach is that it is mostly applicable to highly symmetrical structures. Motivated by the recent advances in nanotechnology for drug delivery, a hybrid discrete-continuum formu- lation is proposed in this thesis, for which only one of the interacting molecules is discretized and the other is considered to be continuous. The hybrid formulation enables non-regular shaped molecules, such as drugs, to be modelled and this is particularly useful for drug delivery systems which employ carbon nanotubes as car- riers. In a limited comparison the hybrid formulation is shown to compare well to both the discrete atom-atom and continuum formulations. The discovery of carbon nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, has gener- ated considerable interest for potential nanomechanical and nanomedical applica- tions. One such device is the high frequency nanoscale oscillator or `gigahertz oscil- lator'. Following the concept of these gigahertz oscillators and the recent discovery of toroidal carbon nanotubes or `nanotori', this thesis examines the mechanics of three nano-oscillators constructed from nanotori. In particular, this thesis investi- gates the C60-nanotorus orbiter which comprises a C60 fullerene orbiting around the inside of a nanotorus. Following this, the nanotorus-nanotube oscillator is examined which comprises a carbon nanotorus which is sucked by van der Waals forces onto the carbon nanotube, and subsequently oscillates along the nanotube axis. Finally, the carbon nanotorus-nanosector orbiter is investigated, in which a small sector of nanotorus orbits around the inside of a second seamless nanotorus of larger radius. These nanotori-based oscillators or orbiters are yet to be constructed and the pur- pose is to assess their feasibility by examining the dominant mechanics. One of the most exciting applications of nanotechnology is the proposed use in drug delivery, and in particular the targeted delivery of drugs using nanotubes. This means of targeted delivery would have significant implications for the future treatment of patients, particularly those suffering from cancer. Understanding the encapsulation and expulsion of drug molecules from nanocarriers is vital for the de- velopment of nanoscale drug delivery. This thesis examines theoretically the loading of molecular cargo into single-walled nanotubes, and the mechanics of a proposed nanosyringe which could be used to directly deliver drugs to cells. In particular, this thesis investigates the suction and acceptance of the anticancer drug molecules cisplatin, paclitaxel and doxorubicin into a carbon nanotube, and the effect on the encapsulation behaviour of alternative nanotube materials, which may be more bio- compatible. In particular, the materials boron nitride, silicon and boron carbide are investigated and compared to the corresponding analysis for the carbon nanotube. Finally, an alternative drug delivery mechanism is investigated, namely a proposed nanosyringe constructed from a double-walled carbon nanotube. For each of these nanomedical applications specific nanotube radii are determined for acceptance and maximum drug uptake, and some overall design guidelines are provided. In summary, the original contributions contained in this thesis are: the develop- ment of the hybrid discrete-continuous method; the concepts of the C60-nanotorus, nanotorus-nanotube and nanotorus-nanosector oscillators; the first mathematical examination for the encapsulation of drug molecules into nanotubes; and the con- cept of a double-walled carbon nanosyringe. These nanomechanical and nanomed- ical applications of nanostructures present exciting possibilities, but there are many practical challenges that need to be overcome before these nanodevices can be real- ized. However, this thesis presents a theoretical study which might facilitate their future development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interpersonal dynamics of aggression and violence in mental health inpatient units</field><field name="creator">Middleby-Clements, Jane L</field><field name="description">Rationale: Mental Health professionals' ability to manage aggression and violence in mental health units is hampered by a lack of evidence-based research. Aim: The research aimed to investigate the relationship between Health Professional attitudes and subsequent aggression by mental health inpatients. Method: An interpersonal model specific to inpatient mental health units guided three empirical studies. Study one investigated patient views on staff management of aggression. Study two examined specific staff variables such as rigid attitudes in dealing with aggression. Study three investigated the impact of a management philosophy upon staff attitudes in a controlled design.  Results: In study one, patients reported that interpersonal factors with mental health staff were salient contributors to their aggression. Study two extended this and found that high staff rigidity was associated with low tolerance for patient aggression. Interestingly, staff characterised by low rigid attitudes were found to be more involved in high severity aggressive incidents. Study three found training in zero tolerance had the unintended consequence of increasing rigid attitudes, while reducing tolerance toward aggression.Discussion: Staff play a role in helping or hindering inpatients with aggressive impulses. Staff with less rigid attitudes were those most likely to assist in difficult incidents, those incidents that are likely to be unavoidable. More rigid staff were involved in a greater proportion of low-medium severity incidents, those incidents likely to be more easily avoided if managed well. Management approaches that reduced tolerance toward aggression appeared to have a negative impact on variables most likely to help patients manage aggressive impulses. Together these studies highlight that staff and management policy are critical variables in understanding and responding to aggression.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The linguistic function of Cantonese discourse particles in the English medium online chat of Cantonese speakers</field><field name="creator">Wong, Yin-Ting (Stephanie)</field><field name="description">Recent technological developments have given rise to a form of communication via the Internet known as online chat. This medium of communication has resulted in a language revolution, at least in Hong Kong where people communicating via the internet have adopted a new variety of language. This new variety is based in English but includes a number of Cantonese and Chinese sentence final particles as well as aspects of the grammar of these languages.It is believed that the use of this hybridised English and especially the Cantonese sentence final particles has a specific function within the context of computer mediated communication especially in online chat such as MSN and ICQ. Most previous research on the use of Cantonese sentence final particles has focussed on their meanings in spoken language (Kwok, 1984; Matthews &amp; Yip, 1994; Luke, 1990; Li 2006; Law, 1990). However, even within this context, the function of these particles has not been subjected to a rigorous systemic functional interpretation and systemization.This paper reports on a study which seeks to provide a systemic functional description and systematization of Cantonese final particles as used in English computer mediated communication (CMC), by definition a written medium. Since the Cantonese final particles have tended to be a feature of spoken rather than written language, this study illustrates an example of the evolution of language and of linguistic change in progress.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AC loss in Ag/Bi-2223 tapes in AC field</field><field name="creator">Farhoudi, Mohammad Mehdi</field><field name="description">Bi-2223/Ag tapes are currently the only HTS that can be classified as &#8220;conductor&#8221;; i.e. long lengths of the tapes can be purchased and used in practical applications. They have started their use primarily in applications with alternating currents (AC), such as transformers, high current/low voltage cables, motors and generators.The energy losses in practical superconductors are negligibly small under suitable working conditions. However, Bi-2223/Ag tapes are composite conductors, consisting of superconducting filaments in a silver matrix. Composite conductors are associated with additional losses when the tape is used in AC applications, commonly referred to AC coupling loss.The susceptibility of different tapes to the coupling losses is usually described by effective transverse resistivity, P&#8869;. P &#8869;differs from resistivity of the silver matrix, and it is a convenient way to describe the susceptibility of a tape to the AC loss. Coupling currents between the filaments flow in a complicated pattern because of the complex geometry of the tapes. The coupling current loss depends not only on the resistivity of the silver matrix, but also on the spatial distribution of the currents. Therefore, the overall shape of the tape, as well as the architecture of the superconducting filaments in the tape are important factors defining the coupling losses. The geometrical factor needs to be known for determination of P &#8869;and is for tapes usually taken simply as the aspect ratio of the tapes, a/b, where a is the thickness and b is the width of the tape. The Abstract proposed study is aimed at determining the effective transverse resistivity of 8 filamentary untwisted Bi-2223/Ag tapes, fabricated by the PIT method and heat treated at 837oC. This takes into account the filament configuration, tape thickness and width as well. Three thicknesses of 0.18mm, 0.24mm and 0.33mm tape were studied. Ic, X-ray diffraction, and optical microscopy measurements were performed in order to characterise the tape. The Bi2223/Bi2212 phase ratio in the composite is XBi2223=~87%, and there is no bridging between the filament and no discontinuities. The Ic values for the thicknesses are: Ic(0.18mm)=11.2A, Ic(0.24mm)=17.85A, Ic(0.33mm)=13.8A. The Ic vs. thickness values demonstrate an optimum thickness for Ic.Measurements of the frequency dependence of the AC loss makes it possible to obtain the value of  P &#8869;&#61472;for each thickness-length of tape. This measurement was performed using an induction method, with the excitation field applied parallel to the face of the tape. The P &#8869;&#61472;is large, comparing to the tape matrix resistivity, P Ag.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The forgotten forests : the environmental regulation of forestry on private land in New South Wales between 1997 and 2002</field><field name="creator">Prest, James</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the regulation of private native forestry in two Australian jurisdictions: NSW and Tasmania. Private forests have long been the forgotten forests - a neglected aspect of forest policy in Australia. Appropriate supervision of private native forestry (PNF) is important because private forests are home to much threatened biodiversity, and as they make up a significant proportion of the total area of native forests in NSW. PNF also makes a substantial contribution to total timber production in NSW. Research was conducted into the administration of environmental laws applying to PNF in NSW between 1997-2002 in order to assess the regulatory framework and to discern patterns of administrative behaviour. The thesis asked &#8220;Were NSW environmental laws applying to PNF effectively implemented and enforced?&#8221; The hypothesis that much PNF in NSW is &#8220;under-regulated&#8221; in practice was explored. To examine these questions, a thorough review of all relevant legislative provisions and case law was conducted. The Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 and the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and their implementation in relation to PNF were examined in particular. Defects in the legislative framework applying during the study period were revealed. The applicable law was found to be complex, and highly fragmented, with responsibility spread across many agencies. Over 100 interviews with agency staff at head office and regional offices were undertaken. Other information was obtained from internal documents and through requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The broader context was addressed by reviewing theoretical literature in environmental law, with an emphasis on the regulatory theory literature. Some regulatory failures stemmed from inadequate implementation of the legislation. It was found that PNF was infrequently regulated under the Native Vegetation Conservation Act, primarily due to a problematic exemption for specified types of PNF. In the North Coast and Hunter regions the exemption was claimed by 100% of PNF operations (on land tenures where it was available). PNF was found to be infrequently regulated by local government under Local Environment Plans (64.5% of 107 local governments did not regulate PNF in the main rural zone). The safety net mechanism of licensing under the Threatened Species Conservation Act was infrequently applied with only five licences granted for PNF. Regarding law enforcement, a low level of prosecution activity was found to have taken place. The findings support the proposition that in practice NSW law was inadequate to ensure ecologically sustainable forest management, due to the poorly designed and integrated statutory framework. They also provide some evidence to support the proposition that the applicable laws were generally implemented with a light touch, generally expressing a laissez faire approach to PNF in most regions (with some exceptions). These findings suggest there is a pressing need for reform of the regulatory framework in NSW, if standards of ESFM are to be achieved. Thus any future exemptions must be of narrow application. Further, a more pro-active approach to ensuring compliance with legislative requirements is necessary. While the results suggest regulatory failure, they do not constitute grounds for wholesale replacement of regulation with other mechanisms such as self-regulation and incentives payments. Issues of compliance and enforcement as well as adequacy of funding are crucial to choices of policy instrument for biodiversity conservation on private land.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extra-musical consequence: reconsidering antecedent/consequent motivations</field><field name="creator">Blinkhorn, Daniel</field><field name="description">Our lives are affected by the antecedent and the consequent as both a natural and mundane physical function and as a highly complex metaphysical construct.

The novelty of this UWB PHY is based on a combination of complementary code division multiplexing (CCDM), which yields a low-interference signal with a variable process gain, and multicode interleaved direct sequence (MCIDS) spreading, which provides an additional fixed process gain as well as multipath robustness. To operate at the high sample rates needed for UWB, the digital logic, realized in a Virtex-II field programmable gate array (FPGA), has a highly-pipelined architecture for real-time signal processing. In addition, the gate count is minimized by avoiding the use of explicit buffer memory wherever possible. The performance of the transceiver is analyzed under a variety of UWB channels and impairments. It is concluded that the proposed UWB PHY offers robust performance in real-world environments and that it is viable for use in future communication systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The significance of language for accounting theory and methodology</field><field name="creator">Nasseri, Ahmad</field><field name="description">The significance of language for accounting theory and methodology is investigated and discussed through three different approaches. First, linguistic analyses of accounting language declare that some difficulties and misunderstandings in accounting are grounded in language and linguistics. The relevance of linguistics to accounting is examined through analysing a number of Iranian accounting terminology cases (e.g. hesaabdaaree, sarghoflee, etc.). It is shown that improving accounting theory and practice necessitates considering its linguistics. The linguistic significance of language on accounting is that, without considering language and linguistic problems, misunderstandings and difficulties are drawn into accounting. Translation, ambiguity, and acronyms are introduced as the most effective linguistic problems that produce difficulties within accounting. Secondly, philosophical investigations reveal that identifying accounting [as well as any other human knowledge] is entirely related to language. A philosophical foundation is established through criticising Frege&#8217;s definition of thought, idea, truth, and falsity. It is argued that truth and falsity, contrary to what Frege argues, have different natures and thus different methods of inquiry. It is explained how the dangerous similarity of truth and falsity is a matter of language and how language trammels true meaning and false meaning into the same trap. The philosophical criticism results in a multidimensional explication of accounting. The three main dimensions of accounting are empirical, critical, and hermeneutical accounting. The singular definitions, generalisation, and boundary presumptions of accounting theory are consequently criticised.Finally, hermeneutical accounting is studied historically to explore the presence of language in accounting. Hermeneutics has found several different readings through time. The implications of divergent readings of hermeneutics in accounting are examined through reviewing the accounting literature. It is revealed that very few accounting contributors have so far considered the interpretive aspect of knowledge. The few hermeneutical explanations of accounting which do exist nevertheless, declare that accounting is a text which requires interpretation. This thesis totally adds value of the existing body of accounting theory by introducing and examining linguistic problems that cause difficulties and misunderstandings within accounting, analysing two problematic cases of Iranian accounting terminology and thus evidencing the relevance of a linguistic approach to accounting, explaining the dangers and difficulties arising from acronyms within accounting, criticising Frege&#8217;s philosophy and concluding that true thoughts are different in nature and method of inquiry with false thoughts and then discussing that accounting and all human knowledge as they are intended to be true thoughts but not false ones are to be discovered and not created, identifying accounting as a multidimensional knowledge, and finally explaining the hermeneutical dimension of accounting through an historical analysis. The thesis entirely approaches empirical, critical, and historical analyses to announce that language plays a crucial role in theorising and practicing accounting. It is evidentially emphasised that dismissing language and linguistic problems of accounting weakens accounting theory and methodology.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using assumptions in service composition context</field><field name="creator">Lu, Zheng</field><field name="description">Service composition aims to provide an efficient and accurate model of a service, based on which the global service oriented architecture (SOA) can be realized, allowing value added services to be generated on the fly. Unlike a traditional software module, which runs within a predictable domain, Web Services are autonomous software agents running in a heterogeneous execution environment. Because of distributed responsibilities, ownership and control, it is often not feasible to acquire all information needed for the service composition. These characteristics of autonomy and heterogeneity are fundamental to service oriented computing but make it inherently difficult to avoid service conflicts. To reason about and adapt to a changing environment, in this work, we will extend current OWL-S by introducing the concept of service assumptions which allow reasoning with incomplete information.

However, the security deployment for MANET routing operations is problematic. Firstly, existing secured routing protocols are deficient in achieving both authentication efficiency and full scale of security. In addition, the diversity of routing protocols presents difficulties in the generalisation of the security design. The most possible candidate solution, the digital signature, has far from been properly implemented from an ad hoc point of view. In this thesis, we are motivated to provide necessary security features to MANET routing operations in an efficient manner. Considering the feasibility of utilising digital signatures in MANET, we incorporate the notion of the online/offline signature scheme in our design, where the computational overhead is shifted to the offline phase. We also make use of the one-time signature scheme, which is efficient in computation, and the multisignature scheme, which is especially suitable for group authentication. Then, we observe the specialities of different routing protocols (AODV-ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing and DSR-dynamic source routing), as well as the similarities between above signature schemes. In our design, we exploit the effciency and the adaptability of signature schemes. As our contributions, we propose two authentication schemes to secure AODV and DSR protocol respectively. For AODV protocol, our ID-based online/offline signature schemes enhance the authentication performance by properly balancing the computational overhead, whereas the one-time signature scheme achieves the same objective by making trade-offs between computation power and memory storage. For DSR protocol, we provide a generic construction from ID-based online/offine signature schemes to ID-based multisignature schemes, so that the installation over AODV can be transformed to offer the same level of security for DSR. Our scheme is unique, in the sense that a single ID-based online/offline signature scheme can be applied to both AODV and DSR routing protocols.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical methodologies for agent-oriented conceptual modelling</field><field name="creator">Krishna, Aneesh</field><field name="description">Many modelling techniques tend to address &#8220;late-phase&#8221; requirements while many critical modelling decisions (such as determining the main goals of the system, how the stakeholders depend on each other, and what alternatives exist) are taken during early-phase requirements engineering. The i* modelling framework is a semiformal agent-oriented conceptual modelling language that is well-suited for answering these questions. This dissertation addresses two key challenges faced in the practical deployment of agent-oriented conceptual modelling frameworks such as i*. First, very little exists by way of principled methodologies for eliciting agent-oriented conceptual models. The high-level and abstract nature of these models poses special challenges in devising elicitation techniques. Second, there has been limited adoption of agentoriented conceptual modelling techniques in industry.We address the first challenge by developing a novel elicitation technique based on requirements capture templates. These templates can themselves be derived from enterprise/ domain ontologies and organisational models, and interact with these in interesting ways.Our approach to addressing the second problem is based on the observation that the value of conceptual modelling in the i* framework lies in its use as a notation complementary to existing requirements modelling and specification languages, i.e., the expressive power of i* complements rather than supplants that of existing notations. The use of i* in this fashion requires that we define methodologies that support the co-evolution of i* models with more traditional specifications. This research uses the notion of co-evolution in a very specific sense to describe a class of methodologies that permit i* modelling to proceed independently of specification in a distinct notation, while maintaining some modicum of loose coupling via consistency constraints. This research examines how this might be done with formal specification notations (specifically Z) as well as an industry standard modelling language (UML). Our aim, then, is to support the modelling of organisational contexts, intentions and rationale in i*,  while traditional specifications of functionality and design proceeds in either the formal notation or UML. Much of this research has been motivated by issues arising from an industry-scale enterprise modelling exercise conducted for an emergency services agency.This research has been validated through a detailed case study involving a major government emergency services agency (who provided funding for this project). A very large-scale and comprehensive agent-oriented conceptual model of this agency and its requirements has been developed, and forms the basis for the validation component of this dissertation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on wear and surface roughness of work roll in cold rolling</field><field name="creator">Li, Hongchun</field><field name="description">The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the evolution and tribological behaviour of work roll surfaces in cold rolling because surface deterioration affects the quality of products and the efficiency of production. The cost of rolls is almost 25% of the cost of cold steel production. An experimental Lateral Set-testing (LST) mini-mill was developed to make use of the Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator functions to evaluate, for the first time, the roll material surface features, surface roughness, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of frequency distribution, after single and multi-pass rolling.  A low carbon-steel was prepared for the paired disc and then experiments on disc-to-disc wear were carried out to test surface deterioration and friction.  In the laboratory, material imitating an industrial roll was manufactured. One batch contained 4%Cr and another contained 4%Cr plus approximately 0.1% Ti. These materials were compared against each other in the LST and disc-to-disc experiments.  Experiments considered a series of parameters, including strip reduction, speed, and lubrication, while the disc-to-disc experiments considered duration of wear, forward and backward slip and load amplitude. The surfaces of the LST roller and disc were evaluated by surface technologies such as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and surface profile-meters. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction wear properties. Test results from the mini-mill reveal that dominant waviness of the surface roughness still exists on the surface after a single pass of rolling and a 30.5% reduction is a critical reduction level that has a significant influence on the density of power spectrum. A rougher work piece results in a larger power spectrum of the surface profile. It has found that the PSD altitude of the roller surface is significantly affected axially but is more sensitive to its original surface roughness circumferentially. It is distributed in an inverse order to the surface roughness in a high frequency domain. The addition of Ti alters surface deterioration. Lubrication has a significant effect on surfaces containing either 4Cr% or 4%Cr+Ti, affecting surface roughness of rollers containing 4%Cr more significantly.  In the disc-to-disc tests, more material was removed in the first 60 minutes from the disc containing Ti than the disc containing only 4%Cr. In general, roll material with 4%Cr+Ti reveals to have better anti-abrasive properties than the roll with only 4%Cr, while lubrication significantly reduced the wear rate and amount of material removed from both materials. The speed of the disc influences the weight loss, ie, the higher the speed the greater the amount of material removed. The slip rate also affects roll wear and weight loss because as the speed increases, so do the slip and loss of weight.  The coefficients of friction are between 0.35~0.75 when the contact was dry and 0.06~0.11 when lubrication was applied. Adhesive friction dominated the dry contact while a mixed lubrication regime features friction behaviour when emulsion lubrication was applied. A backward slip of 2% and a forward slip of 1.5% resulted in a different coefficient of friction in dry contact mode although the corresponding torques were similar.  The torque and coefficient of friction are found to increase with disc speed in dry contact condition.  Lubrication alters the friction of both materials. The coefficient of friction decreases with speed on the disc with added Ti but the effect of load is in the opposite trend, while the disc with 4%Cr was less influenced by speed. The coefficient of friction is more sensitive to load at higher speeds on the disc with 4%Cr than at slower speeds on the disc with Ti added.  This indicates that the addition of Ti enhances the tribological behaviour of rollers because the disc with Ti additive is characterised by carbonitrades precipitated in a refined tempered martensitic matrix. Coarse carbides characterise the 4%Cr disc materials.  Surface defects of the work rolls, including banding, spalling, marking and welding in a cold strip plant, were investigated. It was found that early failures principally resulted from operational factors and roll material off-specification micro-structure defects rather than wear.  It is recommended that different grades materials of the roll and strip with different roughness and hardness to be tested and studied on the evolution and tribological behaviour of roll surfaces in the future.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel nanostructured electrodes</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yong</field><field name="description">Nanotechnology provides an effective and direct way to create novel properties and phenomena through the reduction in material sizes without changing the materials&#8217; chemical composition. A number of routes to the preparation of novel nanostructured electrodes were investigated in this thesis. These involve the formation of nanoporous opaline electrodes, three dimensional nanofibrous networks and the synthesis of flexible nanoelectrodes based on highly dense ordered aligned carbon nanotubes and conducting polymers. Excellent improvements with the use of nanostructures in a wide range of application areas such as methanol oxidation, photoelectrochemical cells, enzyme biosensors, cell culturing and energy storage are presented in this research work.Nanoporous opaline structures including inverse opals and opals were prepared by either electrodepositing Pt or sputter coating ITO onto self-assembled polystyrene (PS) synthetic opals, followed by the removal of the PS opal templates. A highly ordered dense nanoporous structure with the porous structure on the top (so-called Pt inverse opal) or with the porous structure on the bottom (so-called ITO opal) was consequently obtained after the removal of PS templates. The improvement in electrochemical area with the use of nanostructures was observed during electrochemical characterisation. The resultant nanostructured Pt inverse opal electrodes were employed in electro-oxidation of methanol. Compared with the Pt film electrode, the nanostructured Pt inverse opal electrode showed a higher catalytic performance and good stability with a 100 mV negative shift of the potential of methanol oxidation. The mesoporous ITO opal electrode was used as the substrate for the electrodeposition of polyterthiophene and the resultant structure was subsequently utilized in photoelectrochemical cells. An excellent power-conversion efficiency of 0.109% and an outstanding short circuit current density of 1470 &#956;A&#8226;cm-2 for polyterthiophene deposited at room temperature were obtained; dramatically improved from the previous published work.Nanofibrous electrodes were fabricated from biomaterials (such as DNA and poly(styrene-&#946;-isobutylene-&#946;-styrene) (SIBS)) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using the electrospinning technique. Initial studies quantitatively determined the influence of solution properties (such as the solution ionic conductivity, surface tension and viscosity) and process parameters (e.g. tip-to-collector distance, applied potential and the feed rate) on the electrospinning results. Results showed that good electrospun fibrous networks could be obtained from the solution with comparatively high conductivity and viscosity with low surface tension. It was also found that the average diameter of the electrospun fibers decreased with decreased feed rates, increased tip-to-collector distance and increase in the potential employed. With the addition of SWNT, both biomaterial nanofiber electrodes exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties. The resulting DNA based electrospun fiber electrode showed a broad linearity range and high sensitivity in enzyme biosensors. The SIBS/SWNT nanofibrous electrode demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and suitability for the growth of L-929 cells.Flexible, light and highly conductive nanostructured electrodes were prepared from aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) and conducting polymers by coating with Pt coated poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/PVDF. Pt nanoparticles were subsequently electrodeposited on the ACNT/Pt/PVDF structure. The utilization of the nanostructured ACNT/conducting polymer electrodes in anodic methanol oxidation and as anodic materials in Lithium-ion batteries was demonstrated. Pt nanoparticles coated ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode exhibited an outstanding electrochemical capacity (133 Fg-1) and amazing electrochemical surface area (143 m2g-1 for Pt nanoparticles). The Pt nanoparticles-ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode also showed a 2.5 times higher steady current density for methanol oxidation when compared with the ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode. A stable current density over a long period (more than 12 hours) was obtained. A 50% improvement in capacity during Lithium-ion battery tests when compared with a SWNT paper was obtained with the ACNT/PEDOT/PVDF electrode.Nanostructured flexible and conductive electrodes were also obtained from ACNTs and biomaterials (such as SIBS and poly(lactide-co-glycolide)). SWNTs or Pt were introduced to improve the conductivity. A significant improvement in electrochemical properties with the addition of Pt or SWNT was obtained. The biocompatibility of ACNTs, SWNTs and Pt was confirmed during cell culturing experiments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiresolution scalable image and video segmentation</field><field name="creator">Akhlaghian Tab, Fardin</field><field name="description">Due to the popularity of multimedia applications, many efforts have been directed towards presenting new services and functionalities such as interactivity, manipulation, content-based retrieval, scalability, etc. Object-based image/video representation and processing is one of the approaches considered to meet these desired functionalities. However, semantic image and video segmentation is one of the unresolved challenges of this approach. Although many works on segmentation have contributed towards this goal, there are still numerous areas requiring further research. In this work, a comprehensive range of image and video segmentation algorithms, including low and high level phases, are proposed, tested and analysed. In the low level phase, the image/frame is partitioned into homogeneous regions while in the high level phase , the 'objects-of-interest' are extracted. The proposed algorithms are useful for generic segmentation applications, in particular for scalable coding, which distributes information over heterogeneous networks. One of the requirements of the scalable coding is that the shapes of an object produced at different resolutions should be similar, more precisely, the low resolution objects should be the down sampled version of the higher resolution objects. A multidimensional processing integrated with the multiresolution segmentation processing reduces computational complexity and provides a scalability feature for the extracted objects/regions at different resolutions, which is necessary for the scalable coding algorithms. Including smoothness as a visual quality criterion in the segmentation and classification algorithms improves the visual effect of the segmentation results. To meet the scalability and smoothness constraints, a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework with enough flexibility to meet the constraints is utilised. The proposed algorithm is a reliable and effective low level segmentation which includes the desirable features of both single and multiresolution segmentation algorithms. Different objective and subjective tests such as number of regions, discriminating between meaningful regions, smoothness and examination of visual attractiveness by measuring/estimating the smoothness function confirm the superiority of the proposed scalable algorithm over the regular single and multiresolution segmentation algorithms. The novel objective function gives flexibility to the proposed algorithm to segment YUV colour images where Y is in full resolution but U and V are in half resolution. At the high level phase of the image segmentation process, a hierarchical searching method for extracting the 'object-of-interest' is introduced. The search is based on the concept of the global precedence effect (GPE) of the human visual system (HVS) which searches for the large (global) objects before the small (local) ones. The proposed algorithm compares different combination of regions with the 'object-of- interest' template to find the best combination. An irregular pyramid is developed which retains the global objects at the lower levels. A hierarchical search for the 'object-of-interest' template starts from the lowest level of this pyramid. This natural priority in searching is very useful when the 'object-of-interest' is the main object in the image. The computational complexity of the search is reduced significantly. In video segmentation, the 'object-of-interest' in the first frame is determined either by user's intervention or the proposed 'object-of-interest' extraction algorithm. In the subsequent frames, regions generated by the spatial segmentation are grouped into foreground and background areas by a MRF-based classification algorithm. The objective function of the classification algorithm includes spatial and temporal continuity, motion constraints and smoothness terms. The proposed algorithm tracks the objects detected at the previous frames and extracts the newly appearing objects in the current frame. The algorithm is developed in scalable multiresolution mode where the corresponding regions at the lower and higher resolutions are processed and analysed together. The proposed algorithm extracts moving objects at different resolutions with scalability and visual quality (smoothness) as constraints. It allows larger motion detection, better noise tolerance and less computational complexity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lives of the Saints</field><field name="creator">Huntington, Sylvia</field><field name="description">Lives of the Saints is a feature-length, multi-story film screenplay, which explores the obstacles and ethical dilemmas of three protagonists, George, Kristine and Marianne, in their struggle for self actualisation. The screenplay is an example of the siege genre. It is largely structured as a sequential narration but also utilises non-linear narration. The work explores the premise that a saint is one who remains true both to the self and to their responsibilities. The protagonists' journeys begin with the death of a young girl, Rosetta, who has a connection to them all. Each protagonist responds to this event in his/her own way and embarks upon a search for a more satisfying way of life, and for freedom of selfexpression. Middle-aged George explores emerging gender and sexuality issues. Adolescent Kristine finds her faith in God, and in her mother, waning but has nothing to replace them with. Marianne, the driver of the car that killed Rosetta, is initially determined to avoid responsibility for the death, but ultimately finds her own liberation in doing so. George and Kristine's path to self actualisation also puts them in conflict with their families. Marianne too, in trying to escape responsibility, is at odds with those around her. Ultimately however each protagonist is able to resolve their situations and allow room for consideration of the needs of others. Striking a new balance between the self and others allows the protagonists to attain 'sainthood' as defined by the work. An academic commentary outlines the influences and writing process for Lives of the Saints. An exploration of ethical philosophy, specifically Christian, Ancient Greek and Hindu, was an important step in the development of the screenplay's premise and in the creation of the ethical worlds of particular characters. An understanding of sainthood, across religions and as a secular concept, was also important. The choice of narrative structure is discussed; the various stages and challenges in the writing process itself; and an understanding of the work in terms of film genre are also given. The commentary also details with the use of image in the work and places the screenplay in the context of a post World War Two film culture.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accounting, knowing and being: Malaysian multi-ethnographic case studies</field><field name="creator">Mustafa, Hasri</field><field name="description">In the ongoing modernization state of our everyday life, there is considerable common sense that remains deeply engrained but provides excellent framing narratives for the understanding of accounting treatises. These include signs, symbols, images, metaphors and conceptions of those holding the divergent characteristics of 'being-in'. In Malaysian society the most common construction of these are in the inscriptions of 'Bumiputera', 'multiethnic society', 'UMNO', 'New Economic Policy', 'Islam'. At the heart ofMalaysian modernity, they play a significant role in the setting of ideology, politics, religion, race and economics. They are the pathway for the establishment of Malaysian identity and they reflect the characters and contents of Malaysian society. Critically, the key challenge is to address the insights within which lie the distinct genres of ethnographic translation with which knowledge ofaccounting and knowledge about accounting are to be profoundly associated. In this thesis, 'Bumiputera', 'multiethnic society', 'UMNO', 'New Economic Policy', 'Islam' are the themes. They create a critical space for studying accounting as a human science. They suggest the research and present a special problem in the accounting treatises. However, in yielding an ethnographic study of accounting that is to meet this aim, they are to be contextualized not as histories but in organizational discourses. This is important in order to make them visible, that is, although they are 'global' in nature they are to be understood as 'local'. In this study, ECF (Employee Commitment Fund), RCARE (Road-Way Care) and DIB (Darnl Islamic Bank) are the organizations that are to portray the above concern. The basis ofthis ethnographic study is Geertz's interpretive anthropology that advocates that 'one makes detours, goes by side roads', and uses 'methodological sleight of hand', 'experience-near', 'experience-distant' - all that call 'the understanding of understanding'. It is detailed under the following interrelated schemes of the conception of culture: 'by isolating its elements', 'internal relationships', and 'in some general way'. Empirically, in the story ofECF, accounting is depicted as containing the rational and objective view. This is due to the fact that ECF is confined to establish both trust and security in an utopian ideological form. In the story ofRCARE, accounting is written to accompany the socio-political and monarchic view. This view is characterized in the discussions of network of contracts and network of debts in the political institutionalism and corporate hegemony descriptions. As a result, accounting is bound to have priority which is based on maintaining the 'specific' established economic community. In the story of DIB, accounting is scrutinized in the domain of accountability in the conception of khalifah, interest-free and religious auditor. As a conception, accountability is viewed both as a moral motive and obligation. This is discussed in the expressions 'many assistant managers but with no prescribed job description at the commencement of work-too many meetings-spiritless in giving training' issues. Viewed from the perspective that the stories have offered, accounting is presented to intellectually discuss the macro-micro settings: the State, the ruling party, and self-belief. In these pluralistic and conflictual views, supported by the views of doing 'local management control', accounting is seen as enfolding the common sense routines. This is appropriate for highlighting what this study has proposed in treating the accounting discourse as a human science.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software architecture for controlling an indoor hovering robot from a remote host</field><field name="creator">Asthana, Ambika</field><field name="description">To achieve stable autonomous control of an indoor flying robot is a challenging proposition in the field of robotics today. Many researchers are inspired by the echolocation of bats and vision of bees and attempt to duplicate this behaviour by using sonar sensors, cameras and onboard microprocessors. This project aims to achieve the same goal but with a different approach. We propose to build a software architecture for controlling a four-rotor helicopter, DraganFlyer, from a host computer. In order to do this, we equipped the DraganFlyer with communication devices, an Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) and batteries.The DraganFlyer is a four-rotor helicopter that can hover and move freely in air. Due to the near zero friction and damping at slow velocities it is marginally stable in six degrees of freedom. The aim of the overall research project is to understand the dynamics of the DraganFlyer and hence to achieve hover without drift and trajectory following without wandering. Development of software to achieve this level of control from a remote host poses a significant software design problem.This thesis focuses on the software design problem, i.e. the design and development of real-time software for measuring the dynamics and for control of the DraganFlyer. The software runs on a host Macintosh and is divided into three main sections. One is the measurement of DraganFlyer motion with an INS. The second is the calculation of the control commands. The third is the control of the DraganFlyer via the radio control handset.As these sections have different timing requirements, a significant part of the software design and testing time was spent examining how to decompose the system based on timing requirements and constraints. Then we had to determine how to couple these modules together to achieve overall timing goals without data loss.Two types of experimental results are presented. The first results are to test the software, both the correctness of the calculations and their timeliness. The second are measurements of the open loop response of the DraganFlyer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of biologically active indole-fused heterocyclic derivatives</field><field name="creator">Sengpracha, Waya</field><field name="description">New synthetic routes to 1,2- and 2,3-fused indoles with seven- or eight-membered rings have been developed in this project, with the longer term aim of assessing their biological activity. Approaches to such fused indole derivatives were accessed via free radical cyclisation from 1- or 2-substituted indole derivatives with haloacetamide precursors. Using 1-substituted indole derivatives with haloacetamide functionalites, free radical cyclisation reactions gave fair yields of the indole- and dihydroindole-fused eight membered ring derivatives. Using 2-substituted indole derivatives with haloacetamide functionalities, prepared in turn by a palladium-mediated cyclisation of N-substituted indoles followed by hydrolysis and subsequent decarboxylation, free radical cyclisation afforded the 7,12-dihydro-indolo[3,2-d]benzazepin-6(5H)-one (Paullone) system in fair yields. A novel synthetic approach to a bis-indole fused seven-membered ring system was developed based on an N-substituted spirooxindole rearrangement. The spiro-indolinols obtained from partial amide reduction underwent rearrangement to give the bis-indole fused seven-membered ring derivatives 270 and 271 under acidic conditions. Antimicrobial activity of the indole fused eight-membered ring systems was evaluated. The compound 5,14-dihydro-10-methoxy-5-methoxy-5-methyindolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzodiazocin-6-one 186c showed by far the most potent antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus aureus), while 5,14-dihydro-5-(4-methoxybenzyl)indolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzodiazocine-6-one 186d showed good in vitro antimalarial activity against both drug resistant and drug sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum.

With the increasing of convenience and popularity of network, more and more malicious users utilize network to obtain their vicious intentions. In order to protect network users&#8217; information security and privacy, various intrusion detection systems were proposed and developed in the last decade. Intrusion detection as an emerging technology has made great achievements in theory and practice, whose aim is to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system or resource. As a complex system, the development of an intrusion detection system includes many aspects, such as system architecture design, design and implementation of system components, system test in real cases, and so on. Though many intrusion detection systems have been presented, most of them mainly focus on one or two aspects of intrusion detection systems. This thesis aims at providing a rudimentary solution for an agent-based Peer-to-Peer distributed intrusion detection framework. The major contributions of this thesis include the following five aspects. 1. Introducing a novel Peer-to-Peer framework which involve different agents on different peers; 2. Designing functionalities of each agent in the framework by using JACK/UML approach; 3. Representing knowledge of each agent about intrusion and detection according to employing ontology; 4. Developing an efficient task allocation protocol which is used to coordinate different hosts in the system to collaboratively detect distributed attacks; 5. Implementing and testing the framework in a reasonable manner by utilizing an agent development environment, i.e. JACKTM. In summary, this framework integrates agent technology, Peer-to-Peer architecture, ontology technique and a task allocation protocol. Implementation and experiments v show the potential applicability of this framework to real cases. In addition, this framework could help in development of a good intrusion detection system in open and complex environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) community of practice responding to curriculum change</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Deborah K</field><field name="description">In 1999, the New South Wales Board of Studies (NSW BOS) released a revised Stage 6 Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) syllabus1. This syllabus signalled a significant discursive shift with subject knowledge altering to reflect a sociocultural perspective of health and physical activity. This shift challenged the identity of many Physical and Health Education teachers who have historically created their professional self around the scientific discourses of human movement.Physical and Health Education teachers have been criticised for their lack of engagement with and insensitivity to the socio-cultural aspects of the revised syllabus (Gard &amp; Wright, 2001; MacDonald et al. 2002), and been described as &#8220;elitist, sexist, 'pragmatic sceptics' and anti-intellectual&#8221; (Tinning, 2004). Given this professional identity, the question arose as to how professional development could assist NSW PDHPE teachers to engage with and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the revised syllabus?Therefore the aims of the study were to identify the professional identity of the members of the community of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) of PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers and establish how this identity influenced their preferences for particular aspects of the Stage 6 PDHPE syllabus. As a further educational outcome of this research, suggestions for professional development were proposed to assist PDHPE teachers to engage with curriculum change.As a mixed-method study, data gathering involved surveying PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers, and undertaking semi-structured interviews with 25 PDHPE teachers. A range of NSW BOS and educational systems&#8217; professional development documents were used as artefacts. Survey data were analysed using Chi Square and Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Interview data were analysed for themes relating to the value of participating in communities of practice to assist in responding to curriculum change. The results from the examination of both the survey and interview data sources indicated that a range of factors influenced the HSC option selections of NSW PDHPE HSC markers. These factors included the academic ability, sex and interest of their students. The profile of HSC markers also influenced their HSC option selection, with sources of professional development, years of teaching experience and sex of the marker being the most influential factors. The representative sample of HSC markers indicated that they were practical doers, seekers of certainty, gendered interpreters of the syllabus, and conservative participants in the broader PDHPE community of practice who maintain the status quo.The results of the survey data further revealed that the pre-service PDHPE teachers in the research sample were influenced in their selection of HSC options by their students&#8217; interest, their own expertise and interests, the pedagogy they believed could be used to teach a particular option, and the application of the option beyond school.Both HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers indicated the benefits of engaging with colleagues as a resource for learning about a socio-cultural perspective of health and physical activity.By cultivating particular conditions within the PDHPE community of practice, members could engage with the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 syllabus through their participation in situated and reflective learning experiences. The results of the thesis clearly indicate that by participating in overlapping communities of practice, acting as brokers, and creating time for reflection and shared dialogue that NSW PDHPE teachers can make meaning of and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 Stage 6 syllabus.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erosion rate of chemically stabilised soils incorporating tensile stress-deformation behaviour</field><field name="creator">Muttuvel, Thevaragavan</field><field name="description">Problems associated with erodible soils have been reported in Australia and many parts of the world since the early 1970s. Significant soil loss from embankments, internal erosion and piping are some of the problems that practicing engineers face during the construction and maintenance phase of earth structures constructed with erodible soils. It is therefore necessary to identify appropriate stabilisation techniques to control erosion. This study considers chemical stabilisation as an erosion control method and a rigorous testing program has been conducted to investigate how effectively two chemical agents (general purpose Portland cement and lignosulfonate) control the erosion rate of two natural erodible soils (a silty sand and dispersive clay). In this study, a Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) has been designed and built to conduct tests on chemically treated and untreated soil samples. The effect of the degree of compaction and moulding water content on erosional behaviour of soils has also been addressed. In addition, the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of chemically treated soil samples have been investigated using a uniaxial tensile testing apparatus, designed and built at University of Wollongong for this current research study. One of the main objectives was to develop an analytical model for the erosion rate that incorporates the tensile stress-deformation characteristics of the soil. The model has been developed based on the law of the conservation of energy and validated using the results of erosion and uniaxial tensile tests conducted on chemically stabilised soil samples. The results of the tests indicated that the erosion rate changes linearly with the hydraulic shear stress; slope of the line that represents the coefficient of soil erosion. The coefficient of soil erosion decreases, while the critical shear stress increases with an increasing amount of stabiliser, irrespective of the soil type. It was also found that the coefficient of soil erosion of chemically treated soil has a strong relationship with its critical shear stress. Uniaxial tensile tests on chemically treated saturated samples showed that both stabilisers increase the tensile strength with a decrease in the displacement at failure.Model validation demonstrated that only a fraction of flow energy (i.e. efficiency index) is used for the erosion process, and it depends on the hydraulic conditions of flow. Moreover, the proposed model can be used to predict the erosion rate of chemically treated erodible soils, if the tensile stress-deformation characteristics, mean particle diameter, dry density, and mean flow velocity through the crack are known.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental communication and involvement with young drivers</field><field name="creator">Papakosmas, Mary</field><field name="description">This research aims to contribute to young driver safety strategies by focussing on the role of parents, that is, their influence on and communication with novice drivers. In the ongoing efforts to address the issue of young driver safety, parents are a vital resource as, in the majority of cases, they assume the role of supervising driver when their children formally obtain a learner&#8217;s permit. A qualitative methodology was adopted in order to effectively gather data and explore the issues. A series of focus groups was conducted to document the experiences of parents and the sons and daughters they were teaching to drive. The study found parents modelled negative behaviour in the years leading up to the learner&#8217;s permit and during the learning phase, which conflicted with the safe driving habits they attempted to teach the novice. Parents&#8217; efforts to communicate with young drivers about safety were largely unsuccessful. Research findings also highlighted parental teaching issues, specifically confidence and competence. In terms of young drivers, the research found dissonance in relation to two areas: when under parental supervision they drove with less risk than when driving solo or with peers; and the safety information they admitted needing was different to indications they gave their parents. They also had poor driving competence after licensing, yet regarded their licence as a major social milestone which, when reached, gave them a strong sense of maturity and independence. The findings are discussed in terms of their application to social marketing theory&#8217;s principle of positive behaviour change for social benefit. This discussion highlighted a number of practical interventions designed to promote safe driving practices among novice drivers.  The interventions utilize both upstream and downstream strategies.  They include enhancing driver training and testing in order to address skill and behaviour deficiencies, interventions to address parental driving behaviour, and support for parents as driving teachers.  Finally, the implications for further research are also addressed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composition : pure data as a meta-compositional instrument</field><field name="creator">Barkl, Michael L.G</field><field name="description">The aim of &#8220;Composition: Pure Data as a Meta-Compositional Instrument&#8221; was to compose a folio of original electronic pieces that used Miller Puckette&#8217;s open source program Pure Data (Pd) as a &#8220;meta-compositional instrument&#8221;: that is, as a vehicle for documenting the creative process in a graphical way as a type of analytical notation.

Despite her reclusive lifestyle, correspondence permitted communication with a dispersed and select readership. Her epistolary personae construct this accessible presence despite her physical withdrawal. This dissertation explores how her interpersonal textual strategies closely follow the kinds of interactions sought in face-to-face encounters to form intimate, lasting friendships. The complex philosophical issues associated with self-consciousness and identity are enacted and discussed in Dickinson's letters because her textual self-construction became a significant relational activity. Identity construction and role-play allowed her to speak in a society that pressured women to remain silent. Her roles as letter-writer, storyteller, intimate confidante, thinker, and poet will be closely examined here. Besides these epistolary personae, her innovative linguistic style transformed letter genre by combining poetry and prose to create a unique textual voice which allowed her to articulate her experience as a woman aspiring to literary achievement. Close textual analysis reveals how epistolary interaction influences the texts and writers who engage in it, as well as the interpretive challenges for readers who attempt to chart these textual companionships over time through access to the collected letters. By recording her ideas in epistolary text, Dickinson left to posterity a detailed portrait of her complex and passionate identity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of advanced electrode materials for use in rechargeable lithium batteries</field><field name="creator">Needham, Scott Andrew</field><field name="description">Batteries are a necessary companion to most portable electronic devices, and the rechargeable lithium battery is the most energy dense and lightest of all the competing battery types. These features make it the most likely battery to be used in future electronic devices, which will be smaller and have increased functionality. Therefore, the performance of the rechargeable lithium battery must continue to be improved in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. This thesis contributes to this goal by developing new materials and novel synthesis techniques for application in advanced rechargeable lithium batteries.A significant contribution to the ever-growing collection of works on the doping of LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 structures in an attempt to raise their practical storage capacities is presented. The practical capacity of these materials can sometimes be increased by aliovalent doping due to the formation of charge-carrying holes, which impart a higher electrical conductivity. In the case of LiCoO2 doped with Mg, V and Mo prepared by traditional solid-state methods, the lithium storage capacity was not improved compared to the un-doped LiCoO2. This was attributed to the formation of lithium-containing secondary phases, which resulted in a lithium deficient primary phase and a higher concentration of Jahn-Teller Co4+ ions. These effects disrupted the intercalation framework and produced a poor electrochemical performance. In contrast, work on the doping of titanium into LiFePO4 confirmed that a complete solid solution could be formed using a sol-gel method, despite several previous works suggesting that the aliovalent doping of this structure was impossible. Doping 1 mol% titanium into the LiFePO4 structure improved the capacity to only 5 % less than the theoretical maximum attainable capacity. The mechanism for this improvement was related to increased p-type semiconductivity in the material.A novel materials synthesis technique, electric discharge assisted mechanical milling (EDAMM), was applied for the first time to the preparation of functional oxides. LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 cathode materials and SrTixCo1-xO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5), which has possible magnetic applications, were synthesized in a matter of minutes with either microsized or nanosized powder morphologies. The electrochemical performance of the cathode materials was shown to be comparable to those delivered by powders synthesized by traditional solidstate techniques. SrTixCo1-xO3 powders could be formed as complete solid solutions with interesting magnetic properties. The EDAMM method shows commercial potential, as it can synthesize a wide range of functional oxide powders in high quantities. Concerning the synthesis of novel materials, this work also reports on the first ever formation of uniform and aligned NiO nanotubes. The nanotubes were up to 60 &#956;m long, had an outer diameter of 200 nm and a wall thickness of 20-30 nm. Compared to nanocrystalline NiO, the nanotubes delivered a 30 % increase in the discharge capacity after repeated cycling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggests that this improvement was due to kinetic advantages.Finally, unique carbon-based SnSb and transition metal oxide nanocomposite materials formed by various chemical techniques are shown to offer promise as anode materials due to their high capacity and excellent cycle life. The use of SnSb alloys has previously been hindered by their poor cyclability, which is caused by volume changes during cycling that result in a loss of electrical contact. Physically mixing carbon in a 1:1 weight ratio with the active material does not improve the cyclability of the electrode, but improves the realized capacity by increasing the electrical conductivity. A superior method of utilizing carbon in a composite form is to synthesize a SnSb-CNT powder, in which the SnSb is chemically bonded onto the carbon nanotube (CNT) nano-network. These powders demonstrated a high reversible capacity and stable cyclability. This method is an effective and promising option to address the problem of volume changes in all high capacity alloys. The Co3O4&#8211;C composite powders were produced by spray pyrolysis of a sugar-metal ion solution. The capacity in cells was &gt; 800 mAh g-1 for over 50 cycles, which solved the capacity fade problems. The improved electrochemical properties were related to the presence of a carbon sheath formed during processing, which acted to prevent excessive electrolyte reduction and retard the development of a thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A disordered C matrix was also formed throughout the bulk powder during processing, which assisted in cushioning the volume changes associated with the electrochemical reaction.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Schismatic mind : controversies over the cause of the symptoms of schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Gosden, Richard</field><field name="description">Doubts about the real nature of schizophrenia are long-standing. There are no laboratory tests to confirm diagnoses and it is not certain whether there is consistency in the diagnostic process. Various models have been developed to explain the cause of the symptoms. The dominant explanatory model is based on medical assumptions that the symptoms are pathological and are caused by an illness of the mind or brain. The medical model embraces a wide variety of psychological and biological theories of aetiology but there is no scientific/medical consensus and all the evidence supporting medical theories is equivocal. This apparent confusion gives rise to questions concerning the validity of a medical interpretation. Alternative, non-medical models explain the cause of the symptoms as being either a mystical/spiritual emergency (mystical model) or as social alienation (myth-of-mental-illness model).When a comparative analysis of the medical, mystical and myth-mental-illness models is undertaken in the light of interest group theory it is apparent that competing interest groups are promoting different explanatory models to achieve political ends. A key determinant of this political struggle involves the selection and emphasis of conflicting human rights imperatives. Human rights are central to the issue of schizophrenia because people who display the symptoms tend to be socially disruptive and, as a result, are frequently hospitalised involuntarily and forcibly treated with drugs that are mentally and physically debilitating.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of vessel-source pollution in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore</field><field name="creator">Emran, Amelia</field><field name="description">The high volume of traffic passing through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore continuously exposes the Straits to the problem of vessel-source pollution, particularly oil pollution. As a strait used for international navigation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (LOSC 1982), regulation of vessel-source pollution by the littoral States are confined within the provisions of the LOSC 1982. The thesis examines the provisions of the LOSC 1982 with regard to the prescriptive and enforcement powers of strait States to address vessel-source pollution in straits used for international navigation. As a case study, the thesis analyses the Malaysian domestic legislative framework to implement the relevant LOSC 1982 provisions in the Malaysian part of the Strait of Malacca. The thesis also examines the existing cooperative arrangements in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore pursued under the provisions of the LOSC 1982 and the extent to which they address vessel-source pollution in the Straits. The thesis concludes that strait States are granted by the LOSC 1982, very limited prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction to regulate vessel-source pollution in straits used for international navigation. In the context of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the thesis establishes the gaps in Malaysia&#8217;s implementation of the provisions of the LOSC 1982 in the Malaysian part of the Strait of Malacca. The thesis also establishes that cooperation has yet to fully materialise in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and even where it is pursued, focus is on navigational safety issues rather than the problem of vessel-source pollution in the Straits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seam position detection in pulsed gas metal arc welding</field><field name="creator">Shen, Hao</field><field name="description">Lack of fusion is a commonly occurring defect in Pulsed Transfer Gas Metal Arc Welding. Under optimum process parameter settings, such defects are mainly caused by positional error of the torch in relation to the joint profile. This project investigated relationships between seam tracking error and welding process parameters in order to detect lack of fusion. Using digital signal processing techniques, it was found that there existed consistent linear relationships between torch standoff and process variables in both the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, when the torch standoff increases, the mean values of both current power decrease, conversely the mean values of voltage and resistance increase. Whilst in the frequency-domain, it was also discovered that the pulse frequency of power supply varies during welding in accordance to changes in the torch standoff linearly. This curious finding was confirmed by the manufacturer as a result of the characteristics of the specific power supply used. Additionally, when torch oscillation is considered, it was established that torch offset produces distinct patterns in current signal waveforms which is affected by welding setup, such as the joint profile and the oscillation frequency and amplitude of the torch. For girth welding of symmetric joints, the following classification rule was derived in order to successfully monitor weld quality (lack of fusion): The signature of a good weld has twice the weave frequency. The signature of a poor weld has the same frequency as the weave frequency. Due to its independent property of the power supply, this rule enables us to monitor weld quality (detecting lack of fusion) efficiently and robustly for any power supply type. Finally, several potential solutions for flexible on-line weld quality monitoring were also proposed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological changes of a small reef island on a platform reef</field><field name="creator">Samosorn, Bongkoch</field><field name="description">This study examines: i) the morphological evolution of a small sand cay on a platform reef over past millennia; ii) changes in its shoreline over past decades; and ii) contemporary characteristics of waves on the reef platform. The study site is Warraber Island located on a platform reef in Torres Strait, Australia. The study is based upon: i) detailed radiocarbon dating; ii) 3-D morphological reconstruction using a DTM; and iii) field measurement of island topography, waves and wind.Temporal patterns of evolution were assessed based on radiocarbon dating on both bulk samples and on specific components. Bulk radiocarbon ages are indicated to be unreliable for the determination of time of sand deposition. However, ages from shells provide a more appropriate indication of time of deposition of sand in this reef setting. Shell ages imply the continual accretion of the island over the past 3,000 years with a long-term rate of accumulation of approximately 900 m3/y. Successive stages of accretion, and episodic progradation are indicated by prominent beach ridges.Variations in island shore position over shorter time scales were examined based on island shape over the past 40 years (1966-2004). Significant change of island shape has occurred only on the southwestern and northeastern ends, rotating in a clockwise direction; the island appears to have undergone net accretion on the northeastern end and erosion on the southwestern end.Wind climate and medium-term wind patterns were reconstructed. The E-SSE winds, especially ESE and SE winds, have been dominant with winds from the WNNW sector subordinate. The influence of sunspot periodicity and ENSO on the wind patterns is not discernible but the initiation of solar magnetic cycle was found to coincide with times of the low magnitude of wind effect.Wave conditions on the reef platform were examined based on the spectra of waves that were measured at a location close to the windward reef rim and five locations around the island. Development of spectral components and saturating conditions were also investigated. Wave characteristics were normally tidally modulated and related to the local wind system. In addition to incident wind wave components generated off the reef, incident short-period wave and infragravity wave components generated on the reef were prominent around the island. Combinations of these three components generate higher and shorter waves on the windward side of the island, and smaller and longer waves on the leeward side of the island. These wave characteristics can initiate movement of sediment around the island and on the island beach.Probable wave conditions in relation to topographical development over the period of island evolution are discussed based on the contemporary wave conditions on the reef platform. Wind climate and associated patterns of waves and sediment transport are major influences on island shape in response to seasonal influence. Changing wind patterns and wave conditions in relation to nearby reefs, and human activities on the island were examined to identify probable causes of change in island shape over the past 40 years. Over the coming decades, the island is likely to be maintained by the transport of sediment already on the reef flat to the island. Further adjustments of the island morphology are anticipated due to changes in climate and sea level. However, even if there is a gradual rise in sea level, sediment supply to the island is still anticipated because of the greater capacity of waves to entrain and transport sediment, presently abundant on the reef flat.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flicker propagation in radial and interconnected power systems</field><field name="creator">Tennakoon, Sankika</field><field name="description">Voltage fluctuations which cause lamp flicker tend to propagate from the point of origin to various parts of a power system exhibiting some level of attenuation depending on factors such as system impedances, composition of loads and frequency components of the fluctuating waveform. Maintaining the flicker levels at various busbars below the planning limits specified by the standards is crucial, and in this regard it is important to develop an insight into the manner in which the flicker propagates via systems operating at different voltage levels. This thesis presents flicker transfer analysis methodologies applicable for radial and interconnected power systems particularly considering the influence of induction motor loads on flicker attenuation.In the first phase of the work, development of the foundations towards flicker transfer analysis methodologies is carried out by investigating the stand-alone behaviour of induction motors that are subjected to regular supply voltage fluctuations. The electrical and mechanical response of induction motors to two types of sinusoidal fluctuations in the supply voltage where (a) a positive or negative sequence sinusoidal frequency component is superimposed on the mains voltage and (b) mains voltage amplitude is sinusoidally modulated are examined. State space representation of induction motors is used to develop a linearised induction motor model describing the response of the stator current and the rotor speed to small voltage variations in the supply voltage. The results from the model reveal that various sub-synchronous and/or super-synchronous frequency components that exist in the supply voltage as small voltage perturbations can influence the dynamic response of the machine in relation to flicker. In particular, oscillations in the electromagnetic torque and rotor speed arising as a result of the applied voltage perturbations are found to be the key influencing factors controlling the stator current perturbations. It has been noted that, the speed fluctuation caused by a superimposed positive sequence voltage perturbation tends to produce extra emf components in the rotor which in turn can reflect back to the stator. This concept of multiple armature reaction has been found to be significant in large motors especially when the superimposed frequencies are closer to the fundamental frequency.The second phase of the work covers the development of systematic methods for evaluation of flicker transfer in radial and interconnected power systems taking the dynamic behaviour of induction motors into account. In relation to radial systems, small signal models are developed which can be used to establish the flicker propagation from a higher voltage level (upstream) to a lower voltage level (downstream) where induction motor loads are connected. Although this method can be applied for regular or irregular voltage fluctuations, emphasis has been given to sinusoidal voltage fluctuations arising from conventional sinusoidal amplitude modulation of upstream voltage. Moreover, the method examines the propagation of sub-synchronous and super-synchronous frequency components that exist in the supply voltage as side bands and hence determines the overall attenuation in the voltage envelope. The contribution of induction motors of different sizes and other influential factors such as system impedance, loading level of the motor are examined. It has been noted that in general higher frequency components of the upstream fluctuating voltage envelope tend to attenuate better at the downstream. A method is also presented which allows aggregation of induction motors at the load busbars in relation to flicker transfer studies.In relation to interconnected systems, a frequency domain approach which can be used to investigate the flicker transfer is presented. This approach can be considered as an extension to the impedance matrix method as described in the literature and can overcome some of the limitations of the latter method. In the proposed approach, induction motor loads are modelled in a more realistic manner to replicate their dynamic behaviour, thus enabling the examination of the frequency dependent characteristics of flicker attenuation due to induction motors and the influence of tie lines in compensating flicker at remote load busbars consisting of passive loads.To verify some of the theoretical outcomes real time voltage waveforms captured from a large arc furnace site have been used, in addition to the experimental work using a scaled down laboratory set up of a radial power system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/96</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synchronizing data stream processing</field><field name="creator">Qureshi, Mohammad Siddique Fawad</field><field name="description">Synchronization of data stream processing has a significant impact on performance of systems where processing of long sequences of data items needs to be done simultaneously.

This usefulness is enhanced if the statements are prepared in accordance with known rules which cannot be altered.  Auditing can provide this assurance.  This research aims at analyzing the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies towards using services of foreign auditors and tries to find out the impact of these services on the companies&#8217; performance, growth and profitability. This research also aims at finding out measures that Kuwaiti companies may need to take to enhance the quality of service acquired from foreign auditors.   It is suggested that organizations will request the assurance provided by auditors in order to demonstrate financial accountability.  This accountability is essentially an obligation to present an account of and answer for the execution of responsibilities to those who entrusted those responsibilities.This study collects data, through a survey, and uses a random sample of adequate size. To achieve its aims, the study applies sophisticated statistical techniques (Factor analysis, discriminant analysis, probit-logit regression analysis and multiple regression analysis) to the recent collected data.A Review of literature indicated that the decision of companies to use services of foreign auditors is affected by types of auditing, auditing philosophy, process and strategy.  It is also claimed that the decision to select a particular foreign auditor depends on the audit objectives, audit competence, independence and audit method. The cost of auditing services is also claimed to be an important factor in using services of foreign auditors. Despite the growing literature on various aspects of auditing, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature.  In particular, no attempt has been made to examine the reason for using services of a particular auditor by particular companies; no previous attempt was made to find out if it is possible to separate different organizations in their selection of particular auditors on the basis of some measurements (e.g. demographic variables); no empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness of the auditors&#8217; characteristics on the use of their services by particular companies; no attempt has been made to determine reasons for using foreign auditors by organizations in small developing economies or to determine the factors underlying foreign auditors&#8217; image in a small oil-producing economy also no research was done to determine the probability of using services of foreign auditors by organizations in a small developing country that lacks experienced local auditors. Most importantly, no attempt was made to assess the attitudes of companies operating in the State of Kuwait towards using services of auditors who operate outside their country.Chapter Three examines the structure of the Kuwaiti economy and its changes over the last three decades.  It also examines the structure of the Kuwaiti companies and the possibility of their adoption of international accounting standards. This structure covers the composition of the Kuwaiti population, labor force, basic social indicators, aggregate supply by economic sector and aggregate demand by type of expenditure, the public finance of the Kuwaiti economy the composition of Kuwaiti foreign trade and its balance of payments. It also analyzes the forms of Kuwaiti companies in general and Kuwaiti companies that are listed in the stock exchange and gives some ideas about the possibility of adoption of international accounting standards by Kuwaiti companies. The determination of sample size and collection of sample data needed to achieve the objectives of the thesis were assessed. The demographic variables of sample companies were examined and the companies&#8217; reasons for appointing a particular accounting auditor were analyzed. Moreover, the demands of sample companies for services of foreign auditors have been assessed and Kuwaiti companies&#8217; evaluation of the services offered by foreign auditors have been investigated.A two-group discriminant analysis has been applied to test for differences in the demographic profile of Kuwaiti companies and the characteristics of auditors that differentiate between Kuwaiti companies that use services of foreign auditors and Kuwaiti companies that do not. The results of the two-group discriminant analysis related to the impact of demographic variables suggest that  firms with relatively greater  assets , liabilities, smaller equity ratio, larger number of branches (local and overseas), greater connections with foreign sources, are eager to employ external auditors .The results of the two-group discriminant analysis related to the impact of the characteristics of accounting auditors indicate that companies which use services of foreign auditors attach great importance to reputation, performance, experience and qualifications of the auditors, while companies that do not use services of foreign auditors attach great importance to cost of auditing, past experience with non-foreign auditors, holistic advice and personal attention offered by auditors. Factor analysis is applied to determine Kuwaiti companies&#8217; attitudes towards services of foreign auditors.  Sample respondents were asked to indicate their degree of agreement about 20 statements regarding the importance of services offered by foreign auditors. Results of factor analysis suggest that there are four factors that motivate Kuwaiti companies for using services of foreign auditors. These factors are: company&#8217;s performance, achievement of operating facilities, growth and reputation.A multiple discriminant analysis has been applied to determine which of the factors predict Kuwaiti companies to use services of external auditors and to test if there are differences in the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies of various activities towards using these services. The statistical results are important in suggesting that there is a significant discrimination between the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies operating in the fields of agriculture, mining and quarrying; industrial production; banking, finance and insurance and various services, towards the importance of services of foreign auditors in the areas of reputation, performance, operation facilities and growth.The logit and probit regression analyses were used to model the decision as to whether Kuwaiti companies that do not currently use services of foreign auditors would use this service in the future. The analysis is based on the data collected through the survey that is based on the random sample of 385 Kuwaiti companies. It indicates that 260 companies do not use services of foreign auditors. The results suggest that age of company, value of liabilities, value of assets and number of branches is important factors in deciding whether to use services of foreign auditors in the future. There seems to be a negative relationship between the age of the company and the probability of using services of a foreign auditor. Recently established companies have a higher probability of accepting to deal with a foreign auditor. The value of liabilities has a strong positive effect on this probability. Also, the increase in the number of branches increases the probability of dealing with foreign auditors. The value of gross revenue seems to exert a slight positive influence on the decision to use services of foreign auditors, while the number of employees does not seem to exert a significant influence.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/69</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of microalloying elements on the hot ductility of thin slab cast steel</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Kristin</field><field name="description">Experiments were preformed on a Gleeble 3500 Thermomechanical Simulator to study the hot ductility behaviour of C-Mn-A1 steel and the influence of Nb, Ti and Nb-Ti additions. The simple hot tensile test has been shown to correlate well to the problem of transverse cracking. Therefore, the principle aim of this research is to gain a greater understanding of transverse cracking during the straightening of continuously cast slabs. In particular, attention was paid to thin slab casting conditions. Hot tensile test specimens were either solution treated in melted in-situ (direct cast) and cooled to the deformation temperature. Solution treatment tests simulated conventional casting, where slabs are cooled to room temperature than heated prior to rolling. Direct cast tests simulated hot direct rolling conditions, where slabs are rolled directly after casting without being cooled below the austenite to ferrite transformation. Specimens were cooled to the deformation temperature at two cooling rates, 100K/min and 200K/min. The cooling rate of 100K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate experienced for a conventionally cast slab, 250mm in thickness. The cooling rate of 200K/min corresponds to the average cooling rate for thin-cast slabs, 50mm in thickness. The development of the combination of thin slab casting of hot direct rolling requires hot ductility work to be performed under direct cast conditions and at higher cooling rates. Surface quality is of the utmost importance in thin slab casting so the elimination of transverse cracking is of prime economic importance. There are significant differences between as-cast (direct cast) and reheated (solution treatment) microstructures. In particular, changes in precipitate behaviour, austenite grain size, and the relationship between segregation and the position of austenite gran boundaries was investigated. An attempt has been made to determine what influences these differences in microstructure have on hot ductility. Niobium bearing steels were selected for the reason that there are still problems with Nb steels regarding transverse cracking. Furthermore, there have been contradictory reports on the effects of Ti additions on the transverse cracking behaviour of NB steels. There is evidence from commercial practice that indicates that small additions of Ti improve the transverse cracking susceptibility of Nb steels. However, laboratory results generally show Ti additions have little influence or even a detrimental effect on hot ductility. Disparities in the thermal history simulated in laboratory tests to actual conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab is the most likely reason for this discrepancy. Therefore, the influence of more closely simulating the thermal history conditions near the surface of a continuously cast slab was evaluated for the Nb-Ti steel. Experimental work involved metallographic and scanning electron microscopy examination of the fracture surface. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine precipitation characteristics. Tensile tests were conducted to determine mechanical properties, where reduction in area (RA) was used as a measure of ductility. The dendritic structure for direct cast and solution treatment specimens was revealed using a heat treatment procedure (normalising). Particle size was correlated to reduction of area for precipitates in the single-phase austenite temperature region. It was shown that particles below 15nm were detrimental to hot ductility. The relationship between interparticle spacing and reduction of area was also determined. Microalloying additions to C-Mn-A1 steels significantly widen the ductility trough but the depth remains similar. Low ductility was found at higher temperatures in the microalloyed steels due the intergrandular failure as a result of grain boundary sliding in the austenite. Grain boundary sliding was favoured by the slow strain rate and was enhanced by fine microalloyed nitrates and/or carbides. Fine particles can pin austenite grain boundaries, allowing sufficient time for cracks to link together, ultimately causing intergranular fracture. Increasing the cooling rate generally lowered ductility further by promoting finer precipitation. The trough depth is similar in all steels as the formation of thin ferrite films controls ductility at the minimum trough position. The formation of thin films of ferrite allowed strain to concentrate in the softer ferrite phase and intergrandular failure occurred due to microvoid coalescence. Direct cast conditions always led to lower ductility compared to solution treatment conditions. This is explained in terms of differences in the microstructure, namely, grain size, segregation and precipitation. It is recommended that direct cast conditions should be used to determine hot ductility behaviour as it more accurately simulates continuous casting conditions. It was found that simulating the thermal history near the surface of a continuously coast slab, as opposed to cooling directly to the deformation temperature, improved ductility of the Nb-Ti steel. This improvement in ductility was attributed to the thermal history providing favourable conditions for coarsening of NbTi (C,N).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-situ studies of delta-ferrite/austenite phase transformation in low carbon steels</field><field name="creator">Niknafs, Salar</field><field name="description">During continuous casting of steel, the delta-ferrite to austenite phase transition occurs following solidification in the meniscus region of the solidifying strand. It is of great industrial significance to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of this reaction because product quality is in large measure determined by events occurring during and shortly following solidification. Moreover, the exact way in which delta-ferrite transforms to austenite may influence the subsequent transformation of austenite to ferrite, by which much of the mechanical properties of the steel is determined. Relatively little attention has been devoted to the delta-ferrite to austenite phase transition in the past, in part because of the difficulty of making in-situ observations at the high temperature at which this phase transition occurs. The recent development of high-temperature laser-scanning confocal microscopy has provided new opportunities to observe in-situ high temperature phase transformations and this technique has been employed in the present study.In order to limit grain boundary pinning by alloying elements and alloy compounds during growth of delta-ferrite grains and their influence on the &#948;-to-&#947; phase transition, the solid-state phase transformation was studied in low-carbon iron-carbon alloys. Experimental observations of the effect of cooling rate on the &#948;/&#947; phase transformation are discussed in terms of three different morphologies that have been observed. At low cooling rates the newly formed austenite phase that nucleated at triple points grow by an advancing planar interface but at higher cooling rates the transformation occurs by a massive kind of transformation. The mechanisms of grain boundary movement also been investigated. Two types of grain boundary movement, continuous motion and staggered motion have been observed. Quantitative analysis of grain boundary movement show that at low cooling rates grain boundaries are stationary for a few seconds after the initiation of the phase transformation and then they progress exponentially.   Computer simulations have been used in an attempt to better explain the experimental observations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lighting design: song of survival</field><field name="creator">Carter, Timothy M</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an overview of the research and concepts behind the lighting design for the production of the play 'Song of Survival'.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The identification of leadership capabilities prior to the recruitment and selection of individuals for leadership roles</field><field name="creator">Williams, David M</field><field name="description">Writing and research in the field of leadership has reached voluminous proportions resulting in many perceptions of the leadership concept.

In the recruitment and selection of leaders it is crucial that the most appropriate leadership capabilities be identified prior to commencement of the process so that the person with the most suitable leadership capabilities is appointed.

The burden of mental illness in Australia is growing, with a corresponding increase in demand for services. Continuity of care and effective discharge planning for people with serious and enduring mental illness is considered a complex and multifaceted process. The aims of this study were to identify actual and ideal stakeholder involvement in the discharge planning process; timing and commencement of discharge planning; frequency of discharge activities; and barriers to efficient discharge planning in the inpatient mental health care setting. A review of relevant literature found overlap and a strong interrelationship in the concepts, definitions and key components of the discharge planning process and continuity of care. A questionnaire was developed for the study that was based on the themes and findings identified in the literature. Response scales were developed for most items on the questionnaire. Those questions without response scales sought participant comments related to particular sections within the questionnaire. Parametric testing of the data was undertaken using basic descriptive statistics, T-tests for matched pairs, reliability analysis of scales, and correlations. Comments provided by participants highlighted issues and gave additional meaning and depth to the quantitative data. The findings of the study identified a need for improved communication and care coordination between all stakeholders involved in the care and planning of discharge for people admitted to the acute inpatient mental health units. High bed demand and pressure to discharge patients prematurely was found to negatively impact on discharge planning. The study also identified a significant gap between actual and ideal involvement of stakeholders in the discharge planning process, and problems associated with timely and effective communication in everyday clinical practice. Barriers to efficient discharge planning were found to impact on the discharge process and limit involvement of patients, carers, hospital health care professionals and community care providers. The study concluded that inpatient mental health workers desire greater involvement in the planning of care, particularly as it relates to preparation for discharge. Perceptions of inequality in the level of involvement and care coordination within the multidisciplinary team lead to feelings of frustration and dissatisfaction, particularly among nurses. Stakeholders directly aligned with the inpatient setting tend to have more involvement in discharge planning than those stakeholders who are community based and who are external to the mental health service organisation. The study also concluded that when discharge planning begins earlier during hospitalisation, barriers related to time, ward factors and communication will have less of a negative affect on the outcome of discharge planning. Discharge planning becomes more effective when communication is more efficient, sufficient time is given to prepare, and relevant stakeholders (including hospital and community health care professionals, the patient and family) become involved earlier in the discharge planning process. Good discharge planning and the facilitation of continuity of care is regarded by mental health professionals as the responsibility of all stakeholders at all levels - this includes the organisation, individual mental health workers, the patient and their family and friends.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between chronic sleep restriction, poor sleep quality and obesity in adults</field><field name="creator">Magee, Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two literature reviews followed by three empirical chapters that examined the relationship between chronic sleep restriction and obesity. Chapter 2 reviewed available research data and presented a theoretical model linking chronic sleep restriction to obesity. This model hypothesises that chronic sleep restriction contributes to obesity by altering energy regulatory hormones such as ghrelin and leptin. It was also argued that factors such as poor mental health, medication use and long work hours contribute to chronic sleep restriction at a population level, and could have implications for improving sleep. This model provides a sound theoretical framework, which was used to guide the subsequent empirical chapters. In chapter 3, the key methodological limitations of previous studies examining the relationship between chronic sleep restriction and obesity were outlined. Methodological recommendations for future research were then provided to facilitate a more complete understanding of how chronic sleep restriction and obesity are linked in the general population. Chapter 4 tested a path model linking chronic sleep restriction to obesity in 325 adults aged 18 to 87 years, based on the theoretical framework provided in chapter 2 and the methodological recommendations listed in chapter 3. The results indicated that short sleep durations and age were associated with obesity, whilst age, uncomfortable sleep environments, irregular sleep/wake cycles and poor mental health were associated with short sleep durations. However, the results also identified potential environmental, behavioural and psychological determinants of chronic sleep restriction that could be targeted in the future treatment and prevention of obesity. Chapter 5 examined the relationship between three dimensions of sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and obesity in 262 adults aged 18 to 35 years. Short sleep durations and increased levels of daytime dysfunction (e.g., sleepiness) were associated with obesity, whilst irregular bedtimes, noisy environments, discomfort and depression were the major factors associated with poor sleep quality. These factors could play a role in obesity interventions that target sleeping patterns and need to be further investigated. Finally, chapter 6 examined the effects of two nights of seep restriction on energy expenditure and neuroendocrine hormones involved in energy balance regulation in ten healthy male adults. The results indicated that sleep restriction led to an increase in ghrelin and a reduction in PYY, which corresponded with increased hunger and reduced satiety. The results also suggested that energy expenditure declined with sleep restriction. These results suggest that sleep restriction could contribute to obesity by altering energy expenditure and the hormonal regulation of food intake. The findings from this thesis therefore suggest that chronic sleep restriction contributes to the development of obesity by altering key pathways identified in chapter 2. The identification of possible determinants of chronic sleep restriction has potential applications for the treatment and prevention of obesity. For example, the factors identified in chapters 4 and 5 could be targeted as a way to promote healthy sleep durations, and could be effective in improving the efficacy of existing interventions for obesity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"By diggers defended, by Victorians mended": searching for Villers Bretonneux</field><field name="creator">Wade, Linda</field><field name="description">When Allan Griffin, Minister for Veterans&#8217; Affairs, stood in front of the Australian National Memorial at Villers Bretonneux on Anzac Day 2008, he told the assembled crowd that the Villers Bretonneux story &#8220;is not as well-known in Australia as it should be&#8221;.

These meanings have changed over time and have both complemented, and jarred with, each other.In 1918, when soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force lived, fought and died around the town of Villers Bretonneux, they formed close relationships with the place and the people there. These relationships stretched out to the Australian home front, so that by war&#8217;s end, Villers Bretonneux had meanings to Australians as a place of military victory, fictive kin, and loss. In the years immediately following the war Villers Bretonneux was figuratively adopted by the city of Melbourne, allowing those Victorians who had already formed an attachment to the area in 1918 to deepen that connection. But as memorials to Australians were constructed at Villers Bretonneux during the interwar years, the town again became a place where different battles were fought. The wartime sacrifices made by school children, and by women, jostled with an official memory which could only see the soldiers&#8217; sacrifice. The personal relationships Australians had formed with Villers Bretonneux were overpowered by the bonds and binds of empire; the ascendancy of a soldier-centric memory evident in the Australian National Memorial, unveiled in 1938, saw Villers Bretonneux lose the resonance it had held for Australians during the 1920s. The Twinning of Villers Bretonneux with Robinvale in Victoria during the 1980s showed how complete that lack of resonance had become. Alan Griffin&#8217;s speech, however, shows that Villers Bretonneux has begun to recover a place in Australia&#8217;s war memories, one based on personal and private meanings. It aptly reflects the notion of a journey in search of Villers Bretonneux, which is the guiding metaphor for this thesis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived usability: foster students interaction through online synchronous chat</field><field name="creator">Lam, Cam Le</field><field name="description">Demand for innovative and accessible Western education throughout Asia has significantly improved the use of online teaching and support tools. Previous research studies of online education have focussed primarily on full online and distance education, and asynchronous tools for fostering communication. Few studies have explored blended learning strategies in an education environment using synchronous tools to support ongoing communication amongst students from South East Asia facilitated by their offshore subject co-ordinator.This qualitative study explores South East Asian students&#8217; attitudes and perceptions to the usability of online synchronous communication and to determine the success of such a tool in fostering communication and supporting group interaction. The study comprises a group of 40 computer science students for Case Study 1 and a class size of 29 students for the second case study undertaking the same subject have agreed to participate in the research.The triangulation method adopted for the two field studies has established that there are interrelationships amongst the three usability constructs in the context of this study. The usability constructs refer to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitudes toward participation.A combination of questionnaires, focus groups and observation techniques have been conducted; and the results show that students&#8217; perception and attitudes are influenced by the multiple and interrelated facets of the online group communication: the human-totechnology interaction, the human-to-human communication, and the capability of the initial studies have elicited the importance of motivation along with connection stability as significant influences on students&#8217; attitudes toward participation. The first case study identified the large group size, the fast speed of the messages posted, and the instability of the technology as key difficulties.A revised methodology was applied to the second case study allowed a more stable environment for evaluating students&#8217; perceptions. A number of underlying interrelating group characteristics and individual attributes including technology and human factors that influence student usability and participation are discussed and presented in Case Study 2.Contrary to the stereotype that Asian students are passive students from a South East Asian background in both case studies have been highly interactive during the online chat sessions. Evidence from the observations and questionnaire feedback showed that all participants contributed to the discussion and were heavily engaged with the live chat sessions. The majority of participants indicated that they value the opportunity to interact with the offshore lecturer, and to receive timely feedback to their queries.According to student perceptions, the findings from the various data collection methods have shown that the medium being easy to use, a less confronting form of communication as well as useful for enhancing communication and learning objectives. Common themes across the two case studies include suggestions for greater clarity and quality of the messages posted; and that the pace of the message flow should not inhibit a student&#8217;s ability to participate in the open dialog. The lack of visual cues means that no movement on the screen can lead to participants concurrently posting messages. This calls for the need to find a balance between too much activity and no activity, which could further improve the quality of participation.Overall evidence from this research suggests that the interaction amongst the students is highly positive. The studies indicate that there is great potential for students from South East Asia to use synchronous chat, under this particular blend of learning, to actively participate and engage in their learning. This research provides a good foundation for further studies to evaluate and improve on the delivery of synchronous online tools</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency and productivity in Botswana's financial institutions</field><field name="creator">Moffat, Boitumelo D</field><field name="description">The productivity and efficiency of the financial sector is pivotal to the attainment of economic growth and development in developed and developing economies alike, and is of particular interest in the wake of financial sector reform and restructuring. The financial system in Botswana has undergone major structural and institutional changes in recent years. Throughout the 1980s a series of financial reforms were introduced to boost the efficiency and productivity of financial institutions by enhancing the crucial role of market forces (BoB, 1999). New entrants to the system and new products such as Automated Teller Machines (ATM), credit and debit card services were permitted as a result. To date, no study has been carried out to assess the impact of these reforms on the efficiency of financial institutions in Botswana.The main aim of this study is to conduct an empirical investigation of financial institutions in Botswana with a view to assessing their technical efficiency and productivity. By investigating technical efficiency and productivity among financial institutions in Botswana, this study addresses the following three questions: a) What is the mean efficiency score of financial institutions in Botswana? b) What is the total factor productivity change for Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions? c) What are the major determinants of efficiency in the context of Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions? Data envelopment analysis, which is a non-parametric approach, is employed in this study to analyse empirically the technical efficiency and productivity of financial institutions in Botswana. In order to assess the robustness and sensitivity of the results, three approaches namely, value-added approach, intermediation approach and operating approach are employed in defining the inputs and outputs of the institutions. The results suggest an asymmetry between institutions regarding their technical efficiency under different approaches over the years. Similar to Dos and Ghosh (2006), the yearly technical efficiency estimates under the value-added approach are mostly higher than those of the other two approaches. This is because DEA is a flexible technique and produces efficiency scores that are different when alternative sets of inputs and outputs are employed.Most of the inefficiency identified stem from the under utilisation of resources, as well as from the current scale of operation. This is consistent with other studies, for example, Rangan et al. (1988); Favero and Papi (1995); Taylor et al. (1997); Sathye (2001); Drake (2001) and Neal (2004).  The overall average efficiency score under the three approaches during the sample period for Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions is 0.62. This figure lies below other efficiency indices reported in other studies (for example see, Sathye (2003)), and this suggests that the banks in Botswana are performing relatively poorly. In terms of productivity analysis, the results indicate that there has been a loss or little productivity growth at the frontier during the period in question, although there has been some improvement in the relative efficiency of most of the financial institutions in Botswana. The loss in total factor productivity has, therefore, been mostly due to technological regress. The empirical results demonstrate that foreign institutions are, overall, relatively more efficient than their public counterparts under the three approaches. It is unlikely that public institutions, by virtue of undertaking most of the government borrowing programs, can generate a significant fee-based income from this source.The poor overall productivity performance of Botswana&#8217;s financial sector is cause for concern, as it is likely to constrain the growth and development of the overall economy. As a consequence, the authorities will need to rethink their reform measures to date with the objective of stimulating more competition in the marketplace.This thesis has made three significant contributions to the analysis efficiency in financial institutions. First, this is the first study to address the issue of efficiency and productivity in Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions using DEA and Malmquist indices. Second, this study has employed a larger category of financial institutions than that of other studies. Finally, no previous study has assessed efficiency, productivity and their determinants in one study. This study, therefore, extends the existing literature by assessing the efficiency, productivity and the determinants as one study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics, music education and the construction of school knowledge</field><field name="creator">Sang, Vivienne Huifen</field><field name="description">This study examines the construction of school knowledge with particular focus on the impact of socio-cultural-economic discourses on music education. The context of the study is the Integrated Curriculum as structured in school textbooks for secondary education in Taiwan. The study is guided by the following questions: 1. What is the impact of the socio-cultural-economic discourses on the integration of music knowledge? 2. How is the integration of knowledge realised in the Arts and Humanities textbooks? 3. How are the goals set for the domain of Arts and Humanities made manifest through the integration of knowledge? A mixed research method and the case study approach are employed to answer these questions. Regarding the epistemological factors interwoven in the Arts and Humanities textbooks, several theoretical perspectives offered in integrated curriculum, music education, and critical theory scholarship form the conceptual, qualitative foundation of this study. A quantitative approach investigates the extent of integration of arts knowledge and the relative coverage of different arts disciplines and a modified form of Critical Discourse Analysis is employed as the methodological tool to explore a selection of discourses in texts. Data sources include the relevant documents of the Integrated Curriculum project, textbooks and the National Syllabus which is taken as the blueprint of educational practices in Taiwan. Data analysis involves investigating integrated models, the relationships between the content knowledge, competency benchmarks, and curriculum goals, and the socio-cultural-economic discourses in and/or behind the texts. The conceptual framework employed throughout the study is based on the aesthetic theories and the critiques of culture industry proposed by Theodor W. Adorno. Based on his social observation, he argues a loss of autonomy of the individual where music is being manipulated as a means of social control. The socio-economic phenomenon of &#8216;cultural turn&#8217; can be viewed as Adorno&#8217;s &#8216;culture industry&#8217;, generating what Adorno called &#8216;fetished mass culture&#8217;. The lenses of Adornian music sociology employed in this study illuminate the interaction of music with other social agencies. The employment of the lenses to music education further reveals the deconstruction of music knowledge and music aesthetics in the construction of school knowledge. The study reveals the prevalent discourses of how the de-differentiation of &#8216;culture&#8217; and &#8216;economy&#8217; affects the construction of school knowledge. The four series of textbooks adopt different approaches to fulfil the goal of knowledge integration in the context of the Integrated Curriculum. Their approaches manifest how the conception of integration is contextualised in the socio-cultural-economic context of Taiwan. The three case studies indicate that: (1) The creative education is manipulated as an infrastructure for creative industry; the examination of film music points out that the musical signifiers have been turned into the commercially signified. (2) The aesthetic education is transferred to declarative knowledge; the examination of western classical music illuminates the practice of musical symbols in discursive discourses. (3) Multicultural education has become a battlefield of identity and control; the stories of Taiwanese Bunun people disclose a lack of multicultural aesthetics in the appreciation of multicultural heritage. This study thus points to the need for educators to pay close attention to school music education which allows or denies possibilities for aesthetics. The findings also contribute to the research literature about the current status of music education in the broader context of the Integrated Curriculum. The study may also have relevance to educators concerning issues of music appreciation, aesthetics, and critical pedagogy of music education.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the engineering behaviour of railway ballast</field><field name="creator">Ionescu, Daniela</field><field name="description">The ballast layer is the most important component of the railway track infrastructure. It is subjected to both the traffic load and the exposure to environment changes. In consequence, the ballast bed deforms and degrades highly affecting the performance of the railway track. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate in detail the deformation behaviour and degradation characteristics of &#8216;fresh&#8217; ballast for typical loading and drainage conditions specific to railway tracks. Also, it is necessary to identify the factors that highly affect their variation. Better design of ballasted foundation provides higher track performance and ensures reduced maintenance costs. Also, the degradation caused by traffic loading (in field conditions) requires proper measure based on the Australian specifications in order to effectively plan the ballast-cleaning cycles so the maintenance costs are kept under control. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish the potential of using recycled aggregates (obtained from sieving the spoil from ballast maintenance processes) for the construction of railway tracks keeping in this way the maintenance cost to a minimum. In order to further bring light to the behaviour of railway ballast, &#8216;fresh&#8217; and recycled ballast specimens were subjected to monotonic and repeated loading in large-scale equipment (consolidation cell and cylindrical triaxial apparatus). Also, a unique prismoidal testing rig was designed and constructed to investigate the behaviour of railway ballast under dynamic true triaxial loading specific to in-service conditions. The fully instrumented equipment enables the measurement of: vertical pressures at different depth inside the ballast bed, lateral pressure developed within ballast layer, vertical and lateral plastic flow of ballast specimen upon loading. The results show that the ballast shear strength, degradation and plastic deformations (vertical and horizontal) are functions of the ballast type, confinement level, load magnitude, and are also related to the number of loading cycles. The most conspicuous observation is that independent of ballast type, gradation, maximum particle size and loading and drainage conditions, the grains crushing highly affect the strength and deformation characteristics of ballast. It was also observed that the degradation is always larger for coarser fractions of gradations modelled. The recycled ballast displayed higher deformation and degradation when compared with &#8216;fresh&#8217; ballast. A higher level of confinement of recycled ballast or restraint of lateral flow (geotextile inserts) may reduce the deformation and degradation of recycled ballast. Furthermore, a degradation index for the field conditions was proposed that properly quantifies the extent of ballast fouling and can be used to predict the ballast-cleaning cycles.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of electro materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Yao, Yueping</field><field name="description">Lithium-ion batteries (or rechargeable lithium batteries) are most advanced battery technology for modern portable electronics such as mobile phones, notebook computers and cameracorders. There are also big potentials for lithium-ion batteries to be used for electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and stationary power storage. In particular, the later will bring a significant contribution to reduce green-house gas emissions and address global warming and climate change. Materials research plays a key role in the development of next generation of advanced lithium-ion batteries with high energy density, high power density, and long cycle life.This PhD thesis describes my exploration on developing new anode materials and cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. I firstly investigated silicon based anode materials since silicon has the highest theoretical lithium storage capacity of about 4200 mAh/g when forming Li21Si5 alloys. The reversible lithium storage mechanism is totally different from that of graphite based anode. It relies on a process called alloying and dealloying instead of intercalation and de-intercalation. However, the formation of Li21Si5 alloys can induce more than 400% volume expansion. The repeated expansion and shrinkage of the silicon electrode will cause cracking and eventually failure of the battery system. A general strategy has been employed to solve this problem. Firstly nanosize silicon powders were used to minimize the volume expansion in local domains. Secondly, silicon particles were embedded in carbon matrix to buffer the volume change during the reaction with lithium. Si-mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) composite anode materials were produced by ball-milling. Si-MCMB composite electrodes demonstrated superior performance (high capacity and satisfactory cyclability), compared to bare MCMB and bare nano-Si electrodes. Silicon-amorphous carbon composite anode materials were also prepared by carbon aerogel method, through which nanosize silicon particles are homogeneous distributed in carbon matrix. A reversible capacity of 1450 mAh/g for Si-C composite anodes was achieved. The good cyclability should be attributed to the usage of nanosize Si powders and their homogeneous distribution in an amorphous carbon matrix.Carbon nanotubes have many unique and intriguing properties, including as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (VAMWCNTs) were prepared by chemical vapor deposition method. Nanosize SnO2-MWCNTs composites were also synthesized. The VAMWCNTs have a typical diameter of several tens of nanometers and consist of compartment structures. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the carbon nanotubes are electrochemically active to lithium insertion and extraction. A reversible lithium storage capacity of 950 mAh/g has been achieved for CNTs anodes. The solution-based chemical process enables Sn2+ ions to penetrate into the inner cavity of the carbon nanotubes. The SnO2-CNTs composite electrodes exhibited stable cyclability with a lithium storage capacity of 410 mAh/g after fifty cycles. Transition metal phosphides such as MnP4 and Zn3P2 were discovered to exhibit interesting phenomena with respect to reversible lithium storage. They were conventionally synthesized by solid state sintering at high temperature for long periods. After sintering, the products were purified by acid etching, which is a very tedious process. Crystalline iron phosphide (FeP4) powders were directly prepared by a solvothermal synthesis technique. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated the reversible reactivity of FeP4 anodes towards lithium insertion and extraction. The FeP4 anode exhibited a stable lithium storage capacity about 700 mAh/g.Lithium iron phosphate has been emerging as a new cathode material for lithium-ion batteries with low cost. However, lithium iron phosphate has a very lost electronic conductivity, inducing low rate capacity and preventing commercial application. Various cation dopings have been studied with the goal to improve the overall electrochemical performance of lithium iron phosphate. The synthesis, crystal structure refinement, magnetic and electrochemical properties of a series of LiMnxFe1-xPO4 cathode materials was investigated. A number of conductive phosphides and manganese phosphates were found to be formed during the sintering process with the effect of enhancing the electronic conductivity of the materials. The effect of sintering temperature towards the crystal size of LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 compounds were systematically investigated. LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 samples exhibit a typical antiferromagnetic behaviour. This antiferromagnetism could be induced by long range Fe-O-P-O-Fe triple exchange due to the lack of direct Fe-O-Fe interactions. LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 electrodes show specific capacity in the range 150 mAh/g &#8211; 160 mAh/g.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deliberate self-harm: a search for self or a cry for help?</field><field name="creator">Padoa, Carryn Tertia</field><field name="description">Objective: The aim of this study was to advance current research on the functions and expressions of self-injury and in particular to examine two motives of self-harm: (a) self-harm in response to threats to self (termed: search for self) and (b) self-harm as an act of communication to others (termed: a cry for help). Method: Study 1 investigated 45 participants attending accident and emergency departments following an episode of self-harm. All completed a structured interview and a repertory grid task. Interviews transcripts were classified: &#8216;cry for help&#8217; (anaclitic) or &#8216;search for self&#8217; (introjective). Self-harm characteristics were obtained using The Parasuicide History Interview which assesses for the number, method, intent, and medical severity of the self-harm event. Study 2 aimed to replicate study 1 using a clinical sample of 42 patients with Borderline Personality Disorder and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder. Results: Anaclitic typography represented significantly greater risk when compared to introjective psychopathology, despite the latter group exhibiting greater psychological constriction and more frequent episodes of self-harm. In addition, there appeared to be some important differences in the methods of self-harm chosen by the two groups, with anaclitic individuals utilising non-violent but potentially lethal methods compared to introjective individuals who utilised more violent and invasive methods of self-harm. Conclusion: Suicidal individuals who self-harm may be differentiated in terms of their motive, namely as a cry for help (anaclitic) or as a search for self (introjective). In this study, particular precautions and interventions are suggested following suicidal communications or behaviours by those individuals with anaclitic vulnerabilities, given their cry for help may be associated with more impulsive gestures that are unplanned and thus higher in medical lethality than introjective self-harmers, who engage in more frequent low-level attempts involving carefully planned actions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attempts to find the correct structure of uniflorine A</field><field name="creator">Davis, Andrew Stewart</field><field name="description">The alkaloid uniflorine A was isolated in 2000 from the leaves of the tree Eugenia uniflora L, together with two other water soluble alkaloids, uniflorine B and the known alkaloid (+)-(3&#945;,4&#945;,5&#946;)-1-methylpiperidine-3,4,5-triol piperidine. Uniflorine A was found to be an inhibitor of the &#945;-glucosidases, rat intestinal maltase and sucrase, with IC50 values of 12 and 3.1 &#956;M, respectively, and its structure was deduced from NMR analysis to be structure 1. Uniflorine B was also found to be an inhibitor of the above &#945;-glucosidases and its structure was determined from NMR analysis to be structure 2. The initial goal of this study was to complete the total synthesis of 1 and determine the validity of its proposed structure. In the event, an efficient 9-step diastereoselective synthesis of 1 was achieved by using the Petasis borono-Mannich reaction, ring-closing metathesis and stereoselective cis-dihydroxylation as key steps. The structure of our synthetic 1 was unequivocally established by a single-crystal X-ray crystallographic study of its pentaacetate derivative. However, the 1H and 13C NMR data for synthetic 1 did not match with those reported for uniflorine A; the latter showed many more downfield peaks in the 1H NMR, perhaps consistent with the amine salt. The 1H NMR of the hydrochloride salt of synthetic 1, however, did not match the literature spectroscopic data either. We therefore concluded that the structure assigned to uniflorine A was not correct. We also found that the coupling constant J1,8a of 4.5 Hz for uniflorine A, was more consistent with the relative syn-H-8a, H-1 configuration, suggesting that uniflorine A, if it was an indolizidine alkaloid, had the same H-1 configuration as castanospermine. Our attempts to prepare 2-epi-1 and 1,2-di-epi-1 were unsuccessful due to unexpected competing side-reactions. In addition, the diasteresoselective synthesis of the C-1, C-2 di-epimer of 1 was achieved. This synthesis employed a novel pyrrolo[1,2-c]oxazin-1-one precursor to allow for the reversal of &#960;-facial diastereoselectivity in an osmium(VIII)-catalysed syn-dihydroxylation (DH) reaction. The NMR spectroscopic data of this epimeric compound and that of related isomers did not match that of the natural product. From a comparison of the NMR data of uniflorine A and uniflorine B with that of casuarine and the known synthetic 1,2,6,7-tetrahydroxy-3-hydroxymethylpyrrolizidine isomers we concluded unequivocally that uniflorine B is the known alkaloid casuarine. Although we cannot unequivocally prove the structure of uniflorine A, without access to the original material and data, the published data suggest that the natural product is also a 1,2,6,7-tetrahydroxy-3-hydroxymethylpyrrolizidine with the same relative C-7-C-7a-C-1-C-2-C-3 configuration as casuarine. We thus suggest that uniflorine A is 6-epi-casuarine.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of MgB&#8322;-xCx superconductors and understanding their electromagnetic behaviour</field><field name="creator">Shcherbakova, Olga V</field><field name="description">Discovered in 2001, magnesium diboride (MgB2) is the latest superconductor suitable for large scale applications (magnetic resonance imaging systems (MRI), fault current limiters (FCL), high-field magnets). Compared to other metallic superconductors like NbTi (Tc = 9 K) and Nb3Sn (Tc = 18 K), it has the advantage of a higher critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), which enables its application at the temperature of 20 K and, hence, significantly reduces the cost of the cooling system. This, together with the abundance of the magnesium and boron raw materials, as well as the relatively simple fabrication of MgB2 wires and tapes, has motivated the active investigation and study of this superconductor by many research groups all over the world. As a result, a significant breakthrough for application of MgB2 conductors at high fields has been made with introduction of carbon into the crystal lattice of MgB2 via chemical doping. The main focus of this work was on the study of the microstructural and superconducting properties of MgB2-xCx superconductors and establishing correlations between them. To obtain MgB2-x Cx compounds with different characteristics, various C-based doping materials and processing parameters were employed. The systematic study of the microstructural and superconducting properties of MgB2-x Cx samples conducted in this work allowed us: (i) to predict suitable dopants for MgB2; (ii) to improve chemical doping by carbon; (iii) to identify the relevant negative microstructural factors and estimate their effects on limitation of the current-carrying ability in MgB2-xCx samples. The results described in this work can be used as a guide for the achievement of the characteristics required for practical applications of MgB2 superconductors. Investigation of the properties of MgB2-xCx superconductors as a function of the processing parameters showed that the doping level, sintering temperature, and cooling time control the density of pinning centers in MgB2-xCx, and affect the connectivity of grains and transparency of grain boundaries to current flow. Analysis of the pinning mechanism in the samples studied has led to establishing that the dominant pinning is on grain boundaries in the pure MgB2 samples, and on grain boundaries and crystal lattice defects in the MgB2-xCx samples. To demonstrate the effect of the pinning environment on the current-carrying ability in MgB2-xCx superconductors, a comparative study of the microstructural and superconducting properties for pure, nano SiC-, and C-doped MgB2 wires was carried out. In both SiC- and C-doped samples carbon substitution into the MgB2 crystal lattice results in the enhancement of the upper critical field, Bc2. However, it was revealed that the presence of SiC dopant allowed carbon substitution and MgB2 formation to take place simultaneously at low temperatures. Therefore, the microstructure of this SiC-doped sample assures maximal density of pinning centers (large number of grain boundaries, i.e. small grain sizes, and crystal lattice defects) and enhances pinning. These factors (higher Bc2 value and stronger pinning) are responsible for the superior enhancement in critical current density at relatively high fields in the SiC-doped sample. In contrast, for C-doping, higher processing temperatures are required for generation of a dense network of crystal lattice defects. In this case, the microstructure consists of larger grains, and the pinning on smaller number of grain boundaries becomes weaker, reducing the total pinning force and critical current density. An important outcome of this study was the establishment of the dual reaction model (simultaneous formation of MgB2 compound and C substitution into the lattice), which enables us to predict desirable dopants for enhancing the properties of MgB2. These should be C-based compounds which decompose, producing highly reactive C at temperatures below the temperature of MgB2 formation. Ideally, dopants should be homogeneously distributed within host the Mg and B powders and not contaminate grain boundaries in formed MgB2. The liquid mixing approach, a new advanced and at the same time simplified approach to chemical doping of MgB2 superconductor with carbon, was found to partially fulfill these requirements. Carbohydrates (sugar and malic acid) and polycarbosilane (a polymer analog to nano SiC-doping) were employed as doping materials. Liquid mixing has been shown to coat each individual nano sized boron powder particle with a nano-layer of amorphous carbon. Fresh unpassivated carbon extracted from carbohydrates or polycarbosilane easily incorporates itself into the MgB2 crystal lattice. This enhanced incorporation promoted by the maximal reaction surface assured by coating generates microstructure with a dense network of pinning sites and results in significant improvement of the superconducting properties in MgB2-xCx material. The results observed suggest that sugar as a dopant exhibits a stronger potential for practical application of MgB2 superconductor in the high field region than nano carbon doping. Similarly, stronger enhancement of superconducting properties was observed in polycarbosilane-doped MgB2 compared to nano SiC doping. The latter was ascribed to the formation of a microstructure with Mg2Si impurity phases mainly distributed within superconducting MgB2 grains. In this case, transparency of grain boundaries was likely improved, which resulted in the observed enhancement of critical current density over the entire field range. Systematic analysis of the microstructures and superconducting properties of sugar-, malic acid-, and polycarbosilane-doped MgB2 samples demonstrated that the critical current density was also significantly affected by the microstructural properties in the low field region. The results observed led to the development of a model, which allowed us to estimate the level of critical current density (Jc) limitation due to the microstructural features of pure and C-doped MgB2 samples. This model is based on the identification of individual contributions by various defects to critical current density limitation. These defects in the MgB2 microstructure include porosity and non-superconducting phase inclusions (so-called &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects), as well as the connectivity and transparency of grain boundaries. The results observed showed that a higher level of &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects results in stronger limitation of critical current flow through the sample and lower measured Jc values. The elimination of the &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects would result in critical current densities that are a factor of 1.5 - 2 higher than currently measured values. The role of grain boundaries connectivity was found to be even more dramatic. For samples with fully connected grains, the estimated critical current densities were about one order of magnitude higher than the measured values. Moreover, the results of analysis showed that the low field Jc values are mainly determined by the connectivity and transparency of grain boundaries, while in field Jc(Ba) performance is affected by these defects in the microstructure to a lesser extent, and its behaviour is mainly determined by the pinning environment in the samples. It also was observed that while a denser pinning network favors in field Jc(Ba) behaviour, this results in reduction of grain boundary transparency and more pronounced critical current density limitation in the low field region.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian press coverage of the Armenian genocide 1915-1923</field><field name="creator">Kateb, Vahe Georges</field><field name="description">Under the cover of WWI, the Young Turk government of the Ottoman Empire deported and exterminated the Armenian population from historical Armenia (Eastern provinces of modern day Turkey) and surrounding regions. However, since then, successive Turkish governments have denied any wrongdoing and blamed Armenians for their fate. The Australian press, as the only mass medium of the period, covered extensively the extermination of the Armenians. However todays press often refers to the same events ambiguously, using the word alleged and giving equal coverage to the Turkish denial of the events. In addition, young turk has become a complimentary phrase. This thesis examines the coverage of the Armenian Genocide in the Australian press of 1915-1923. The newspapers examined are: Age and Argus (Victoria), Brisbane Courier (Queensland), Mercury (Tasmania), Register Adelaide (South Australia) and Sydney Morning Herald (New South Wales). The aim of the thesis is to determine if Australian journalists of the period had appropriately covered the Armenian Genocide and if the coverage corresponded with the modern definition of genocide as stated in the United Nations Genocide Convention (UNCG). The study compares news reports published on the Armenian Genocide with the acts of UNCG and finds that they had indeed communicated to the Australian public that Armenians were subjected to genocide. In the absence of the word genocide Australian journalists of early 20th century described the meaning of the word as destroying a nation, race extermination, policy of extermination, wiping out the Armenian nation and other similar expressions. The study also looks at censorship in Britain and Australia during WWI. From the wide coverage of the press it concludes that there were no restrictions imposed on the reporting of the Armenian Genocide. Another aspect covered was the religious factor. Armenians were often identified as Christians. The word defined a common denominator between the Australian reader and Armenians. Australia and Armenia were almost entirely Christian nations while Turks were Muslims who were physically and spiritually destroying (churches, monasteries, manuscripts, desecrating religious sites) the Armenian people. Thus, Christian churches were heavily involved in the relief effort of Armenian survivors and orphans. The thesis also examines where Australians were getting the reports on the Armenian Genocide; how the reports appeared in the papers, the headlines of the reports and comparison between headlines and articles on atrocities attributed to Germans, and the extermination of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks. In addition, in the context of war propaganda the study finds that overall the newspapers had given wider coverage to atrocities attributed to Germans, while Turkish atrocities against Armenians had received adequate coverage but less prominence. The thesis reveals the previously unknown fact that Australians had responded passionately to the plight of the survivors by founding a friendship society (Friends of Armenia) and relief society (Armenian Relief Fund). This pilot study focuses only on the Armenian case. Future research should be expanded to include the Australian press reports of ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Christian elements, Assyrian and Greek in Turkey. Hopefully this will raise Australian journalists awareness to the level of their predecessors of early 20th century so that they will be able to counteract the increasing pressure and denial campaign actively pursued by the Turkish Embassy and members of the Australian Turkish community.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Framing the digital: the viewing environment for web specific art work</field><field name="creator">Suliman, Helen-Joy</field><field name="description">Each person who accesses the world wide web usually does so from a position of isolation. To physically sit at the computer and engage in the process of viewing is a solitary activity. While each viewer may experience the web on individual terms, there are common factors which mediate the web viewing environment and which have a significant impact on the way in which that environment is perceived by the viewer. The aim of this thesis is to contextualise and critically examine the functioning of the world wide web as a viewing environment for web specific art work. It does this by focussing on several key aspects of the web environment, and how these shape and form the viewers perspective. In particular, it examines how the web is mediated by the elements of interface, the organising structures of time, memory and knowledge, and the balance between the potential freedoms of the web viewing environment and the powers of government, commerce and institutions which attempt to impose their structures upon it. Understanding the situation and position of the viewer in the web environment is crucial to artists producing web specific art work. The viewer experience is approached through the original ideas of digitality and the viewer pose which describe the interaction between humans and computers as a condition of thought and as a physical process in the context of interface. The world wide web promises many things. It is a unique blending of computer and communications technologies which links its users across the globe through the vast digital network of the internet. Ideally it offers the viewer an opportunity to transcend physical boundaries, interact with other users either one-to-one or as part of a community, and exchange information and ideas immediately and freely. The webs ability to facilitate the creation of structures which are fragmented and non-hierarchical, through interface and hyperlinking, shape the viewers experience. This thesis examines these aspects of the viewing experience and uses concepts proposed by Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia (1980) of the rhizome, and smooth and striated space to expand and elucidate the discussion.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial patterns of Lepidoptera in the eucalypt woodlands of the Sydney Basin, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ashby, Lachlan</field><field name="description">The patterns of spatial distribution and abundance were investigated for moth assemblages in the eucalypt woodlands of the Sydney Basin. A total of 228 species of Lepidoptera, distributed among 25 families, were recorded from three national parks located on the perimeter of the Sydney metropolitan region.From within the eucalypt woodland habitat of the Sydney Basin, the study investigated the spatial variation of night-flying Lepidoptera present at several different scales of observation, from the trap level through to across the landscape. Assemblages varied with spatial scale, with uniformity occurring across the landscape as a whole, however becoming patchy at finer spatial scales. Multivariate and turnover analysis indicated that although heterogeneity of abundance and richness may vary significantly depending on spatial scale, sites and national parks contained their own unique suite of species in comparison to one another.The structure of the assemblages of moths in the eucalypt woodlands of the Sydney Basin can vary, and is dependant on the level of spatial scale of observation. Further study needs to be conducted at a range of temporal scales to ascertain the presence of patterns in the Lepidoptera communities in the Sydney region in order to contribute to the development of suitable conservation strategies in the Sydney Basin.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/93</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The little bloke: an authorised biography of John Hatton, OA</field><field name="creator">Richmond, Ruth</field><field name="description">John Hatton stretched the limits of the role of an Independent Member of the New South Wales (NSW) Legislative Assembly further than any politician preceding him. This study is an authorised empirical biography and examines how John Edward Hatton exercised the role of an Independent Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in NSW Parliament during the years 1973-1995. It will show how he acquired power, define the nature and limits of his power, and describe how he influenced government to meet electoral needs, to fight corruption, and institute parliamentary reform. This will include an examination of the man, and his background before entering Parliament, which will show how themes of obligation and probity arose, and how they informed his personal and political behaviour. The scope and limits of his influence will be shown by examining bi-partisan political strategies, the constraints of parliamentary procedure, the working of the bureaucracy and the judiciary. It will compare Hatton's response to these things with that of other Independents, place his career in a social, political, economic and cultural context, and show its significance within the body of literature relating to the role of the Independent. As an empirical biography it will demonstrate that biography is a genre which enhances historical record and that this biography has a significant place in the existing body of literature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the tiger quoll dasyurus maculatus maculatus in coastal New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Deborah L</field><field name="description">The mammal fauna of Australia has undergone a dramatic and significant decline since the arrival and settlement of Europeans on the east coast of Australia. Eighteen native Australian mammals are considered extinct, 35 are endangered and 51 vulnerable, out of a total of 357 species. The Tiger Quoll is considered threatened in all mainland states, it is considered rare in Tasmania, and it is listed as endangered under Federal legislation. At the commencement of this study, little was known of the biology of the Tiger Quoll and virtually nothing was known of its ecology. In this study, I used captive Tiger Quolls at Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney, and wild populations at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve on the mid-north coast of New South Wales and at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park on the Illawarra escarpment south of Sydney to investigate several aspects of Tiger Quoll biology and ecology.Studies on the breeding biology and growth of Tiger Quolls were undertaken at Featherdale Wildlife Park. Tiger Quolls have a single breeding season each year and at Featherdale Wildlife Park Tiger Quolls mated in May with births in June. Some females had a second and sometimes third oestrus cycle if the first didn&#8217;t produce pouch young. Matings and births were fairly synchronous, occurring mostly over a two to four week period with a gestation length of about 21 days. Growth curves were developed for small pouch young and juveniles and age prediction curves were developed for small pouch young up to 60 days. Both males and females reached sexual maturity in 11 months and could breed in their first breeding season following their birth. Older females reared larger litters to teat release than one-year-old females. Females increased in weight prior to the mating period, developing fat deposits around the neck. Sexual dimorphism between the sexes, males being larger, became clearly apparent by 250 days of age.In wild populations at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve, mating occurred in June with the birth of a single litter recorded in July. Wild young were smaller than same-agedcaptive young and growth of wild young is likely to be slower once they have left the pouch. Drought conditions are likely to affect the growth of young.The spatial and social organisation of Tiger Quolls was investigated at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve. Males and females were found to have large home range areas. Adult females had discrete home range areas, ranging in size from 509-1511 hectares, separate from other adult females, although some daughters occupied part of the mother&#8217;s home range area. Adult males had much larger home ranges (2302-3401 hectares), which overlapped extensively with other males, and intersected 2-4 female home ranges. Den sharing was never observed, except between mothers and young, and sequential use of dens by different individuals only occurred several months after the former occupant had disappeared. Adult females generally moved to a new den each day except after pouch young released the teat and were deposited in a maternal den. Tiger Quolls undertook extensive movements on a daily and weekly basis, particularly males, with maximum recorded daily journeys of 5 and 8.5 kilometres for females and males respectively. Over longer periods males were recorded travelling over 20 kilometres in nine days. Activity was not exclusively nocturnal for adult females that may be active in early to mid-morning and late afternoon, especially in cooler months when nursing young.Home ranges included a range of habitat types, heathland, sedgeland, shrubland, forest and woodland but the majority of locality records from trapping and radio-tracking were in forest and woodland. The majority of den sites were located within areas of eucalypt open forest and the majority of dens were eucalypt hollow logs or hollows in the trunks and limbs of live or dead standing trees. Dens were also located in burrows, which appeared to be preferred as maternal dens, under small buildings and in rocky headlands.The diet of the Tiger Quoll at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve and Barren Grounds Nature Reserve / Budderoo National Park (Illawarra) was predominantly carnivorous with a large proportion made up of vertebrate prey at both sites (85-91%). Mammals comprised the major vertebrate group with smaller contributions from birds (9-16%), reptiles (2-7%) and fish (13-24%). Insects were present in a greater proportion at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve (26%) than the Illawarra area (13%). Plant material was present in the diet at both sites, as was garbage. There was potential for some competition between the Dingo and Tiger Quoll at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve as Dingoes took a large amount of bandicoot as prey, which was also a common prey item of Tiger Quolls.Several aspects of the biology and ecology of the Tiger Quoll make it susceptible to a range of threats. Large home range size for both males and females makes the species vulnerable to clearing and fragmentation of forest and woodland habitats, to the threat of roadkill from increased traffic density and speed and to increased direct predation from eutherian carnivores such as the fox in rural landscapes and domestic pets in urban areas. Tiger Quolls are subject to direct persecution from humans due to their attraction to kill and eat caged birds such as chickens and their attraction to carrion increases the chances of death by roadkill.The control of eutherian predators such as the fox and Dingo through 1080 poison baiting programs has the potential to affect Tiger Quoll populations through non-target kills and may have increased impact if undertaken in the restricted breeding season of Tiger Quolls and if undertaken for several consecutive years. Impacts may be greater on low-density populations. The removal of Dingoes may have a detrimental impact on Tiger Quoll populations if Dingoes are suppressing fox numbers. Further investigation of the potential impacts of poisoning programs and the relationships between eutherian and marsupial carnivores is required.The protection of a number of large Tiger Quoll populations throughout the species geographic range and the protection and enhancement of forested corridors across the landscape may provide some buffer to potential impact of disease, habitat loss or degradation, or invasion of introduced species following climate change to help ensure the species conservation and possible recolonisation of areas of its former range.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing with fire</field><field name="creator">Jones, Matthew</field><field name="description">This research paper examines the essential considerations of my role as a Father, as they reflect and inform my practice as a sculptor. Using initial collaborations with my 5-year-old daughter as a conceptual trajectory, I began to explore domestic rhythms and the communality of multiple objects. Ceramic artist Angela Valamanesh and &#8216;Outsider&#8217; Howard Finster were found to represent the polarities &#8211; austere and chaotic &#8211; of repetition. Artistic engagement with the congenital temperament of a child initiated a return to base sculptural principles, bare materials and processes, pre-dating history and evoking the archetype of childhood. This considered regression led to the development of an exploratory ceramic practise upon the beaches, bush and farmland of South Coast New South Wales, culminating in the ephemeral performance object of a ceramic pit-fire. Formally, I have adopted the universal anthropomorphism of the vessel, consciously grouped and presented as the individual members of small &#8216;communities&#8217;. This method of production resolved itself in the suggestive vacancy of the &#8216;dwelling&#8217;, and the discovery of a largely undocumented international tendency within contemporary art. Artists, including Charles Simmonds, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Katarzyna Jozefowicz and Graham Seaton, create uninhabited environments from tiny assembled modules, achieving the accumulation of a multitude. Similarly, my own work culminates in a series of miniature landscapes, experienced both as amorphous playthings and votive objects. My research demonstrates that, through various natural correlations, the roles of &#8216;artist&#8217; and &#8216;parent&#8217; are adequately conflated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surfing nation(s) - Surfing country(s)</field><field name="creator">McGloin, Colleen</field><field name="description">This dissertation provides a genealogy of the relationship between surfing, the nation, and white masculinity in Australian culture. I argue that, despite its historical connections to countercultural and subcultural expression, surfing has emerged as a cultural formation which, in multiple ways, contributes to and sustains dominant conceptions of national identity. This claim is demonstrated through the investigation of a diverse range of texts produced both within surf culture and outside it, including documentary and fictional cinema, novels, magazines and advertisements. Reading these texts for the politics of gender, race and class that inform them, I identify the crucial connections of surfing culture to the dominant discourses of white Australia, while also attending to the various manifestations of surfing masculinity that do not &#65533;fit in&#65533; with contemporary national identity. As a counterpoint to the congruence of mainstream surfing culture and white Australian nationhood, I discuss the culturally specific views of nation and country that inform contemporary Indigenous surfing culture. This part of the dissertation is supported by the contributions, through conversations, interviews and questionnaires, of Aboriginal surfers and elders in the Illawarra region as well as by readings of Surfing the Healing Wave, a film on Indigenous surf culture, and the Indigenous sports magazine, Deadly Vibe. I demonstrate that Aboriginal ways of understanding and relating to the ocean constitute an important counterpoint to dominant white representations of surfing and beach life generally. The perspectives of Aboriginal participants and contributors to this thesis provide an oppositional view of nation/country and of surfing as a form of cultural expression. These worldviews instate a point of departure from white, &#65533;mainstream&#65533; ideas of nation and proffer an epistemology that testifies to Aboriginal peoples&#65533; continued resistance to colonialism. Through the voices of Aboriginal people, nation(s), surfing, and the ocean, are contextualised according to a culturally relevant frame of reference. Indigenous voices construct a counter-discourse that contests dominant projections of nation at the level of cultural production and cultural practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High fidelity image: tracing the emergence of a new constructed image</field><field name="creator">Foley, Marius</field><field name="description">In this thesis, High Fidelity Image: Tracing the emergence of a new constructed image, the writings of a range of image theorists are used to develop an understanding of a discernible new construction&#65533;the new constructed image&#65533;and its potential impact on visual communication.

On the basis of these ideas and investigations, the thesis proposes that a new image is emerging, which will correct the imbalance in the relationship between image and text.

With wireless ad-hoc networks, users can get connected with each other, anytime, anywhere. Along with this convenience, users should also be aware that wireless ad-hoc networks, without the support from infrastructure, are weak against adversaries' attacks. The security problems that were previously dealt with in traditional networks, now have to be addressed again. This thesis aims to provide a secure communication channel for wireless ad-hoc networks users. This can be achieved by providing two fundamental cryptographic schemes: Encryption/Decryption and Digital Signature. By encrypting the content of communication, users can assure that even the communication is eavesdropped by adversaries, they can not obtain any information. The challenge is how do you setup the required encryption/decryption keys for each user efficiently, where there is no support from infrastructure. We provide a solution in this thesis. On the other hand, digital signatures provide a way for users to authenticate others within the network. When a suspicious user wants to join the network group, decision can be made if he can not provide a valid signature. These schemes provided in this thesis, give wireless ad-hoc network users a secure communication environment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/38</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Induced currents in gas pipelines due to nearby power lines</field><field name="creator">Markovic, Dejan</field><field name="description">Significant voltage levels can be induced in gas pipelines due to power lines in areas where they share the same corridor, especially during a fault. These voltages can a_ect the operating personnel, pipeline-associated equipment, cathodic protection systems and the pipeline itself. Quite often, mitigation is required to reduce these induced voltages to levels that are safe for personnel and integrity of the pipeline. This thesis investigates and evaluates the performance and capabilities of two software packages that have been developed to calculate and manage induced voltages on pipelines, PRC and CDEGS. As it was the superior package, CDEGS and the interference analysis based on it is presented in detail. The complete interference analysis, including steady state and fault conditions, was performed on the Young-Lithgow pipeline and power line shared corridor. It is shown that pipeline coating stress voltages in excess of levels recommended by the CDEGS procedure may exist for faults on particular power lines. Possible remedial measures are suggested. Subsequently, the existing mitigation system on the Brisbane pipeline, employing insulating joints with permanent earths, is assessed using CDEGS. It is shown that this mitigation is su_cient in regard to controlling pipeline coating stress voltages. Touch voltages on three test points are in excess of levels allowed by IEEE recommendations, but still within levels allowed by Australian Standards. The same pipeline layout is used to analyse the hypothetical case of a mitigation system implemented with zinc gradient control wire. While the pipeline coating stress voltages are within recommended limits, only one test point touch voltage is in excess of IEEE recommendations and again all are within Australian Standards limits. Apart from performance, the two mitigation methods are compared in terms of cost of installation and other features. It is concluded that despite the lower costs of installation of a system with insulating joints, some other features and costs associated with maintenance of the two compared systems favoured the gradient control wire method and made it the preferred method for mitigation of induced currents in pipelines for many configurations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiduciary finance and the pricing of financial claims: a conceptual approach to investment</field><field name="creator">Gold, Martin Lionel</field><field name="description">Australians have over $1 trillion invested in fiduciary products such as pension funds (ABS, 2006a). Since the early 1980&#8217;s, the policies of successive governments have compelled most of the working population to seek its fortune in financial markets. Over the same period investment has emerged, in its own right, as an important business discipline. Scholars have largely avoided critical examination of the discipline&#8217;s scientific status, choosing instead to concentrate their efforts on refining tests of market efficiency. However, corporate debacles and episodic volatility in financial markets have fostered incredulity amongst stakeholders as to how the market actually operates. The overarching purpose of this thesis, therefore, is to evaluate the science of investment and to espouse a conceptual approach to investment which brings the scholarship and applied practices into closer alignment. Particular emphasis is placed on the funds management operations in the market.Existing scholarship has analysed pricing outcomes assuming that economic norms are reflected in investing practices and financial markets overall. Critiques of the discipline&#8217;s flagship theoretical models, however, find that they are disguised tautologies which have not imparted new knowledge, and as such, are pseudo-scientific. Little progress, it is argued, appears to have been made in the discipline since the formative precepts of investment were promulgated in the 1930s and 1950s. Despite the investment industry&#8217;s economic stature, its microeconomic setting, product structures, and interactions with financial markets, have not been integrated into academic research. Ultimately, the vast majority of investors, being secondary investors, are captives of the industry&#8217;s &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;. Winning the &#8220;investment game&#8221; is not, as investors might suppose, a strategy of maximising investment returns: in fact it is a risk-averse strategy of tracking average market performance overseen by the industry&#8217;s gatekeepers. It is only the relative minority of primary, non-institutional, investors who need superior information of the industry&#8217;s endogenous forces and constraints to outperform the market averages.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some biochemcial studies on the human lens nucleus</field><field name="creator">Wei, Xiaojia</field><field name="description">Barrier16 formation has been shown to occur in the lens with age. It is important to understand the physiological changes in the lens that occur upon the formation of the barrier and their implication on the onset of cataract and presbyopia (old man&#8217;s eyes). In this study, three factors related to the formation of the barrier were investigated: diffusion rate changes in the lens nucleus, oxygen consumption and cholesterol compositional changes in the lens with age. A Franz Cell was used to measure the diffusion rate changes in the nucleus of the human lens. No significant differences in the rate of diffusion between young and old lenses could be detected with this technique. The role of protein sulphydryls as secondary oxygen consumers was also studied. It was shown that protein sulphydryls reacted readily with oxygen, suggesting that protein sulphydryls are a secondary O2-consumption system in the center of the lens. Mitochondria are the primary oxygen consumers in the lens. A technique for the quantification of cholesterol in lipid extracts was developed. Results obtained were comparable to published results using traditional methods. The concentration of cholesterol in the young human lens was found to be approximately 3-fold greater than that of the bovine, ovine and porcine lenses, and ~5 times greater x than in the gallinaceous lens. These differences were even more pronounced when an elderly human lens was examined. The nucleus of the human lens was found to have a higher level of cholesterol content than that in the cortex and the concentration of cholesterol also exhibited a significant increase with age in both nuclear and barrier regions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risking code: software art - dilemmas and possibilities</field><field name="creator">Bunt, Brogan</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the emerging field of software art. It is concerned with questions that arise in relation to efforts to think the field of software, and software programming particularly, in aesthetic terms. Centrally, how can software as a technical field of production, as a form of engineering and as a space of abstract, instrumentally-oriented, system elaboration, possibly correspond to art? What are the dilemmas that the notion of software art confronts? How can its space of opportunity be conceived? These questions are pursued not only at a general theoretical level but in terms of aspects of my own software art practice. The thesis begins by considering the ambivalent character of software, examining how it mediates between dimensions of machine process and human agency and how this potential has been conceived in cultural theoretical terms. It then outlines the specific formal features of software programming and reviews competing perspectives of software practice. This description of the software medium establishes a foundation for a specific consideration of the field of software art. I trace the historical emergence of the genre, examine how it has been theoretically conceived and consider a range of exemplary works. I then specify three key dilemmas that confront software art: the dilemma of position (how can software art conceive its relation to the larger economic and discursive space of the software industry?); the dilemma of visibility (how can software art conceive its efforts to make code visible when software itself determinedly, structurally, hides?); and the dilemma of recursion (how is software to avoid an exclusive and disabling emphasis on self-reflection?). In the remaining portion of the thesis, these dilemmas are considered within the specific context of examining issues and aesthetic strategies within my own work. My overall argument is that software art represents a permeable discursive space that discovers an aesthetic potential less by resisting the spectre of conventional software than by risking an intimate relation to this alien terrain. Rather than a calm appropriation of software by art, it represents an unsettling of art by means of software.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical analysis of plasma proteins by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Tadesse, Margey</field><field name="description">Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was assessed as a tool for the analysis of different glycosylated and iron forms of transferrin (tf).

In addition, the intrusions themselves commonly create difficult and expensive mining conditions and the nearby coal is coked, rendering it useless. Dartbrook Coal mine is located in the Upper Hunter Region, on the boundary between the Sydney and Gunnedah Basins, NSW, Australia. This thesis has investigated the impact that two major dykes have had on the coal of the Late Permian Wynn seam, cleat carbonates, and groundwater composition at the mine. Samples of coal were collected in transects, starting close to the intrusions and extending away from the intrusions. Vitrinite reflectance, mineralogy, and geochemistry were analysed on the coal samples to determine the extent of thermal alteration. Additional coal samples were collected throughout the mine-lease and the cleat carbonate was extracted. The mineralogy, [?]O and [?]C composition were analysed on the cleat-infill to determine the source of the dominant carbonate. Groundwater samples were also collected throughout the mine-lease and the geochemistry, [?]S and [?]Sr/[?]Sr composition were analysed to determine if groundwater can be used to detect the intrusions. The vitrinite reflectance, mineralogy, and geochemistry of the coal seams intruded by dykes change dramatically approaching the intrusions. Proximal to the igneous intrusions, the coal changes through four alteration zones comprising normal coal (R superscript o max = 0.8), slightly thermally altered coal (R superscript o max = 1.8), brecciated coke (R superscript o max = 2.5 to 5.0), and natural coke (R superscript o max = 7.0). The greatest alteration occurs between the fingers of the dyke but the pattern of alteration is not uniform; the outer dyke finger caused the most alteration by far, because it acted as a conduit for subsequent intrusions of magma and hydrothermal fluids. Geochemical data for the coal indicate that elements exhibit affinities for minerals (e.g. Na, Al, and Si for aluminosilicate minerals) and display trends of accumulation and depletion approaching the contact depending on those affinities. The majority of elements (e.g. Ca, Mg, Mn, and Fe) are enriched at the coal/intrusion contact. The dominant cleat carbonate is dawsonite (NaAlCO subscript 3(OH) subscript 2), with [? Superscript 13]C[subscript PDB] values between -1.7 and +2.4&#65533; (standard deviation = 0.7&#65533;) and [? Superscript 18]O[subscript SMOW] values between +13.6 and +19.8&#65533;, and a narrow standard deviation (1.7&#65533;). The narrow range of [? Superscript 13]C values and the occurrence of major igneous activity at Dartbrook indicates that the carbon in the dawsonite has a magmatic source, whereas the broad range of [? Superscript 18]O values reflects the direct or indirect impact of local intrusions. The dawsonite formed at a late stage by the interaction of Na[subscript 2]CO[subscript 3]- or NaHCO[subscript 3]-rich solutions with hydroaluminosilicates present in the coal. The groundwater composition displays spatial variations near the two major dykes. The [? Superscript 34]S values range from &#65533;0.3 to +63.8&#65533; (average = +22.8&#65533;), while the [superscript 87]Sr/[superscript 86]Sr values range from 0.704984 to 0.706647. The [superscript 87]Sr/[superscript 86Sr data indicate that the igneous influence is all-pervasive in the study area. The groundwater chemistry exhibited a localised igneous signal near one dyke, which was detected using the products of potassic alteration of K-rich feldspars (weathering products from the dyke). The finding that igneous intrusions can be detected using groundwater composition indicates that the technique can be used during mining exploration. The advantage to early-detection of intrusions is that they can be avoided during mining and a better estimate of the size of the recoverable coal reserves can be made.

Thus, this thesis addresses a major gap in the current historical literature, which has tended to underplay or ignore the role of the BSP. In so doing this work draws a wide range of interviews, archives and hitherto unused research sources, as well as the historical analyses in English and Burmese contribute. The thesis begins by examining the historical and cultural antecedents of the BSP. The party was formed as a major element of Burma&#8217;s independence movement, which developed from a core group of nationalist leaders. Among these leaders were founders and key members of the future BSP. The Peoples&#8217; Revolutionary Party (PRP), the prewar version of the BSP, emerged in the struggle for independence and played a key role in that struggle as a core group around which the future state was founded. After the War, the BSP came out as separate party to compete with the Communist Party of Burma (CPB). The Tatmadaw played a key role in this process, and thus the process itself was a crucial turning point in Burma&#8217;s history. The BSP was the main political party after Burma&#8217;s independence in 1948. This situation can be seen through looking at the way the Anti-Fascist Peoples&#8217; Freedom League (AFPFL) operated as the umbrella of the BSP. The BSP shaped domestic and foreign policies in the period 1948-58, and provided the basis of various forms of government, even at times of internal division. It was in these circumstances that the military aspect of Burmese politics became important. Careful examination of the sources dealing with the major political influences of the post-independence period shows that the Burmese military took their ideas from the BSP and launched their bid for power by taking over from the BSP.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The radical neo-liberal movement as a hegemonic force in Australia, 1976-1996</field><field name="creator">Cahill, Damien C</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the radical neo-liberal movement commonly labelled the new right  as a hegemonic force in Australia between 1976 and 1996. It argues that the movement, through its think tanks, greatly assisted the process whereby the Australian state and economy were reorganised. Such assistance took the form of disorganising opponents of neo-liberalism; helping to shift elite debate to the Right; and offering a language and framework for critiquing the welfare state. It is argued that, in doing this, the radical neo-liberal movement acted as a vanguard for neo-liberal hegemony in Australia. The thesis critically analyses the ideology of the radical neo-liberal movement as well as discussing the ways in which radical neo-liberals cohered as a movement. It assesses the relationship between the movement and the capitalist class, the commercial media and the Australian state, all of which are key sites and agents of hegemonic struggle. It is argued that the effectiveness of the radical neo-liberal movement was primarily due to the links it was able to forge with key fractions of Australian capital. These fractions predominantly finance, mining and monopoly capital were also the ones that mobilised to bring about the neo-liberal reorganisation of the Australian state and economy. In acting as a vanguard movement for neo-liberal hegemony, the radical neo-liberals supported the interests of these capitalist fractions. By understanding the radical neo-liberals as a movement, this thesis examines the way in which a non-class group had an impact that was class relevant.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial Liberalisation in Nepal</field><field name="creator">Shrestha, Min Bahadur</field><field name="description">This study examines the overall impact of financial liberalisation on Nepal&#65533;s financial system and economy. The study is specifically directed towards analysing the rationale of executing a financial liberalisation policy; preparing an account of the evolution, process and sequencing of the financial liberalisation; and evaluating the impact of the various liberalisation measures on financial and economic developments of Nepal with cointegration and causality tests. The study makes significant contributions in the area of the impact evaluation of financial liberalisation. Most of the previous studies focus on the economic growth aspect of financial liberalisation in detail, but attach less importance to the redistribution of income and stability of the financial systems. To bridge this gap, an aggregated framework for impact evaluation, which includes all of the three dimensions, is implemented in this study. The framework implemented in this study is useful not only for the impact evaluation of financial liberalisation policy, but also for other public policies. A summary index of the financial liberalisation comprising eight policy instruments is employed in this study. As some of these instruments have not been immediately fully employed, the index is designed to take into account their gradual implementation. The instruments are interest rate deregulation, removal of entry barriers, reduction in reserve requirement, easing in credit controls, implementation of prudential rules, stock market reform, privatisation of state-owned banks and external account liberalisation. A sequential procedure has been applied to test for unit roots on time series data. This procedure helps to determine the optimal test method for each time series under consideration and reduces the risk of model misspecification and biased results. The empirical test results obtained using the Nepalese quarterly data from 1970-2003 suggest that financial liberalisation in Nepal has had a mixed impact on the financial system and the national economy. The number of per capita bank branches is found to be positively associated with the widening of the financial sector, which in turn affects financial development positively. The real deposit interest rate affects the volume of time deposits (savings) positively, but the increase in gross domestic product does not affect time deposits. The volume of time deposits affects the volume of bank loans positively, but the lending rate does not have a significant impact on the volume of bank loans. Collectively, the financial liberalisation measures are positively associated with per capita income as well as with industrial development. The population density per bank branch is found to be positively associated with the volume of bank credit to the poor, while the overall measures of financial liberalisation are negatively associated with such credit. The results also suggest that financial liberalisation is positively associated with the credit-deposit ratio of the commercial banks. However, the higher credit-deposit ratio is not only associated with higher return, but also with higher risk. Therefore, it can be argued that financial liberalisation has brought instability in the Nepalese financial sector. The overall finding of this study is that financial liberalisation is positively associated with growth, but negatively associated with income equality and financial stability. However, the study does not find any causal relationship between financial development and economic growth in Nepal. Hence, the financial liberalisation in Nepal has not facilitated a financial development to the extend that contributed significantly to the economic development of the country.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational change and accounting information systems: a case study of the privatisation of Jordan Telecom</field><field name="creator">Shanikat, Mohammed</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an attempt to better understand organisational change and its impact on accounting information systems in privatised enterprises using the particular case study of Jordan Telecom (JT), which became subject to the liberalisation of the telecommunication industry. JT would not survive in its public sector form and the privatisation of JT remains very controversial. This study aims to understand the role of the Jordanian State in stimulating the external environment of JT in order to prepare for privatisation, to understand how the internal environment responded to change in the external environment, to understand how the accounting system shaped the pathway of the organisation development, to understand the perceived changes in the accounting information system that was influenced by the privatisation of JT. The literatures of theoretical foundations of the study include the role of the state in reforming the public sector as a basic milestone necessary for preparation of privatisation, and the organisational change and in particular the accounting system changes as a result of the adaptation of privatisation. The thesis uses a case study approach. The data collection consisted of two techniques: an intensive field study of the organisation subject to the investigation in order to explore and explain the privatisation phenomenon. Data collection involved two sources; interviews and documents. The participants that were selected depended on the recommendation of the coordinator from inside the organisation, who was appointed to help the researcher. A combination of theoretical perspectives is adopted to understand organisational change and the accounting information system role. These perspectives are; Institutional Theory, Resource Dependency Theory and Laughlin&#8217;s (1991) Organisational Change Model. The theoretical integration built provides a holistic approach to offer an alternative explanation to social phenomena. A framework was developed which demonstrates the suitability of the theoretical integration for analysing the role of the state and organisational changes during the three distinct eras in relation to the telecommunication industry, which is identified through the historical context of JT. These three eras are pre privatisation, transformation and post privatisation. They provide a foundation for the empirical analysis, which explains the role of external stimuli in disturbing the external environment of organisation. The organisation&#8217;s internal elements are shown to respond to the environmental disturbance and in particular the distinct change in the role of accounting systems. This study adds a significant contribution in studying privatisation from the context of Jordan, a developing country and a Kingdom. The study has findings at two levels.  First the level of the role of the government and JT&#8217;s alliance with the external party France Telecom, for the provision of resources, is reflecting the unique intersection of external stimuli and JT. The study has addressed some of the ways in which an accounting information system has been instrumental in the process of organisational change in the telecommunication industry in Jordan. It demonstrates that without a basic change in the interpretative schemes from a &#8216;technical vision&#8217; to a &#8216;business vision&#8217;, privatisation cannot achieve its objectives. It also provides a significant demonstration that the accounting information system acts as an interpretative scheme between the regulator (TRC) and regulated (JT). Second level, the framework developed here can be practically applied in other studies investigating organisational change. Multi layers of analysis can help inform policy such as mission level, resource level, organisation&#8217;s structure, design and role of the accounting information system, the flexibility to change, the use of new technology and the use of high level of training.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changes in adipose tissue in response to exercise and diet</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Michael</field><field name="description">Why study adipose tissue? What significance does it have within the body? Early anatomists believed adipose tissue to be a relatively inert tissue with a sole purpose to support organs in the body. Growth of adipose tissue is the cause behind obesity. If you examine the statistics related to adipose tissue you would soon see why research is needed in this field. The World Health Organisation has recently estimated that there are 250 million obese and 400 to 500 million overweight worldwide. The International Obesity Task Force has shown that obesity is increasing in all societies, not just in western civilisations. We are soon looking at the prospect of over half of the humans on earth being overweight or obese. The worldwide cost of weight loss programs mounts up to billions of dollars per year. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Type II diabetes along with many other diseases are strongly associated with obesity. Adipose tissue is poorly understood as an organ. The area of adipose tissue vascular research is only in its infancy with one of the first major studies conducted only 55 years ago. All aspects of morphology of adipose tissue and its vasculature are insufficiently described, especially in regards to weight loss. In comparison to the wealth of information known about weight gain, there is very little understanding of weight loss in particular in regards to adipose tissue microvasculature changes. The current treatments for obesity are; drug therapies, diet, exercise and surgical intervention. All of these treatments, however, are temporary and do not solve the underlying problem. Hence there is a need for research into the mechanisms of weight loss and the microvasculature of adipose tissue. For, it is the microvasculature that is responsible for the delivery/removal of substrates to and from adipocytes causing them to grow and shrink in size. Despite the numerous studies and increased awareness into the many causes and effects that adipose tissue growth has there are still areas of uncertainty. The cellular changes that occur in adipose tissue as people become obese are still in much debate. Moreover, the reason as to why there are such varied responses between individuals who eat the same foods in still relatively unexplained. There were three main objectives in this study. Firstly, to describe the microvascular similarities and differences between various rat adipose depots. Secondly, to compare the changes in the microvasculature of adipose tissue in sedentary rats with rats that had lost progressive amounts of weight through exercising. Thirdly, to compare the cellular (number and size) changes in adipocytes from two cohorts of mice that consumed a high fat diet with mice on a low fat (control) diet. Rats were perfused with Microfil and four different fat tissue sites were sampled (mesenteric, parametrial, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous depots). The adipose tissue was prepared using the &#8216;whole mount&#8217; method and stained with a modified Haematoxylin and Eosin protocol. Using light and stereomicroscopy the samples were studied from the level of the arteries that entered the fat pads right down to the microvascular bed. Anatomical descriptions were made of various prominent features displayed by the vasculature and compared and contrasted between the pads that were sampled. The rats were found to display diverse qualities in terms of their adipose tissue and vascular arrangement. All the microvascular beds (capillaries and next order arterioles) were all similar in all the depots displaying either &#8216;Y&#8217; or &#8216;hairpin&#8217; branching characteristics. The connective tissue arrangement was distinct in each of the fat pads. There was also the presence of mast cells and inflammatory cells in amongst the adipocytes and capillary beds. A model was designed whereby rats were placed in running wheel cages for various time periods. These rats were compared with sedentary controls that resided in normal cages but ate the same diet as the exercised rats. Tissue was sampled from all the groups and adipocyte diameter, volume and mean capillary diffusion distance were measured. There were differences between rats that ran and the sedentary rat in terms of microvascular bed spatial arrangement. Capillaries of run rats were closer together as opposed to sedentary rats, which were further apart. A scheme was proposed for the remodelling of the microvasculature of the fat pad in response to weight loss. There appeared to be a relationship between the amount of time spent running and adipocyte cell size effect but this needs further study to be elucidated. An experiment was set up to investigate a different model of diet-induced obesity in healthy wild-type mice. Moreover the main interest was in studying how their adipocytes responded to dietary influences. This study was designed to examine two cohorts of mice that consumed a high fat diet and compared them to low fat fed control mice. The first group of mice were selected as the quintile at the top of the distribution curve for body weight and the second at the bottom of the distribution curve for body weight. There were significant cellular differences in the number and size of the adipocytes when comparing the two cohorts of high fat fed mice with the low fat fed control mice. Several possible mechanisms were proposed to explain the cellular differences observed between the two responses shown by the two cohorts of mice fed a high fat diet. All these sets of experiments provided only a taste of the information that potentially could come with further research into adipose tissue loss and gain. The investigation of adipose tissue has been, and still is, relatively neglected compared with other areas of medical research. Adipose tissue gain (or Obesity) should be known as the silent killer for it is the big underlying factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type II diabetes. There is still a lot of information to be gathered about adipose tissue before any advances can be made towards effective therapies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The South African print media: from apartheid to transformation</field><field name="creator">Kolbe, Hilton Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the role of the mainstream South African print media in perpetuating discrimination during the years of legalised racial discrimination - commonly known as apartheid - from when the Herenigde Nationale Party took power in May 1948 with an unprecedented 28-seat swing under the leadership of 74-year-old Dr Daniel F. Malan until it was replaced by the African National Congress, black-dominated unity government in April, 1994. Against an historical background, it focuses on the agenda and efforts of the mainstream metropolitan print media during the apartheid era, the build-up to the first non-racial elections, and the media's role in the immediate post-apartheid era. Race and class-based inequalities have always been a feature of South African life since settlement when the Dutch arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. The era of racial segregation can broadly be categorised as starting from 1910 to 1948, the Immigrant Regulation Act of 1913 that prevented the free movement of Indians across the provincial borders of Natal, which also placed restrictions on Indians owning land outside Natal province. Black land ownership was subjected to similar regulations with the Scheduled Areas of the Native Lands Act of 1913 and later the Native (Urban Areas) Act. But it was from 1948 that the era of apartheid started under the National Party leader Dr Malan, known as the father of apartheid, a racially discriminatory and evil practice based entirely on racial superiority and aimed at keeping the minority white tribe of Africa in control over the indigenous people. This 'separate development' policy was already entrenched in South African society by the time the National Party took control after the 1948 elections, but Malan legislated oppression by introducing various Acts of Parliament and in 1953 disenfranchised the 'Coloured' people by removing them from the voters' role. Instead of opposing this blatant racism and discrimination that lasted nearly half a century, the South African mainstream print media ' both the English and Afrikaans language press ' embraced the new direction in the early years with an enthusiasm that reflected poorly on the role of the press. During the early reign of the National Party, from 1949 to the mid-50s, the English-language newspapers were weak and fearful, lacked integrity and honesty, and failed in their duty as public watchdog. While the Afrikaans-language newspapers were developing to support government policies, the English press shared similar views. Both the English and Afrikaans press failed in their duties as the Fourth Estate in keeping a watchful eye on government. They never opposed the status quo and offered little or no support for a system of equality for all the peoples of South Africa. Although, in many ways the press was severely restricted in performing its proper role, ultimately it was a white controlled press which profited from apartheid. This thesis argues that despite its efforts, fundamental political change was never the agenda of the press, nor was equality of the various races. Definitely not the Afrikaans press and certainly not the English press despite the role that it seeks to claim in the post-apartheid era as a de facto opposition and a constant nagging thorn in the side of government. At times the English press wore the mantle of the opposition press and chided the government on various excesses but at the same time remained a conservative institution that practised much the same discriminatory policies of apartheid. Now, as South Africa continues along a new path of democracy, it is not a question of whether there is need for a reappraisal of the media in the post-apartheid era, but what shape or form it should take. This thesis aims to redirect the functions and role of the national print media and suggests that while the owners and the gatekeepers remain the same, on their past record, there is a justifiable cause for concern in a country struggling to come to terms with democracy and concludes that fundamental change is needed. By way of conclusion, I attempt to show that the South African print media, despite being hindered by a variety of laws to suppress criticism of the government, was at best hypocritical, at worst inherently racist and secular, tacitly supportive of the apartheid regime during the rule of the Nationalists and is now in need of reorganisation and fundamental structural change to meet the future challenges in a redeveloping nation. It is not a case of whether that change is effected but how it will be done that is at issue. How that change will be effected depends both on a willingness for change on the part of the major publishers, full integration and a more balanced racially-representative staff, as well as a commitment to open government on the part of the ruling establishment. With the demise of the National Party government and the introduction of the first non-racial parliament, it is my contention that it is now timely to forge a new media order, incorporating the best of what is good in the rest of the world and shedding that which is cumbersome while at the same time being sensitive to the development of an emerging democracy. This does not mean that the new media order should be of a restrictive nature, nor is it a call for the media to be less vigorous in its role of keeping Government honest. The press must be free to criticise, investigate and chide the government. However, in the early years of nation building the role of the press should in some ways be more supportive rather than fiercely antagonistic, defiantly critical or adversarial. In short, the new media order should work towards reconciling the need for openness and the right to speak one's mind with the necessity for healing the wounds created by racism. In the words of African National Congress stalwart Albie Sachs (1990): We must remember that the objective is to open doors that are at present closed, not to create more blockages to the free circulation of ideas and information. We would have gained little if we were to replace the present media controls with new ones that simply switch the propaganda and biases around; if one realm of banality takes over from another. Truth has always favoured the democratic cause, and our people are tired of forever being protected in the name of what others think is good for them.1 The press in South Africa does not exist in a vacuum. Large sections of the South African print media grew fat on the machinery of apartheid. Racism was rife in many newsrooms and evidence given to both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Racism in the Media inquiry amply illustrates this. At the very least there is now a moral obligation on the part of the media to participate constructively in the transformation just as there is an obligation on all sectors of South African industries and trades to adopt Black Economic Empowerment objectives.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the P300: target and non-target ERP components in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Brown, Kerri J.</field><field name="description">The P300 component of the auditory ERP elicited to target stimuli has been extensively investigated as a potential psychophysiological marker in schizophrenia. Theoretical and empirical evidence is presented, suggesting the earlier components (N100, P200) to both target and non-target stimuli may better capture information processing deficits currently proposed to be central to schizophrenia. The thesis comprises 4 studies.Study 1 demonstrated deficits to non-target (reduced N100 amplitude, earlier P200 latency), in addition to target stimuli (reduced and earlier N100 amplitude, increased P200 amplitude), in schizophrenia (n = 40) compared with matched normal controls. The schizophrenia group was also characterised by a lack of differentiation between ERPs elicited to target and non-target stimuli, in comparison to the normal control group.Study 2 confirmed the results of Study 1 in groups of chronic (chronic schizophrenia, n = 40) and first episode schizophrenia (FESz, n = 40), and additionally established that in normal controls non-target stimuli occurring immediately before the target (T-1) generated larger N1 amplitudes than the nontarget after (T+1), a pattern that failed to occur in Chronic schizophrenia and was minimal in FESz. N100 amplitude deficits to non-target stimuli were also correlated with clinical symptomatology, particularly with higher levels on the disorganisation factor. Most importantly, N100 and P200 responses to target and non-target (T+1 &amp; 11 T-1) stimuli, were superior predictors in classifying both first episode and chronic schizophrenia patients than were the more commonly employed P300 measures.Study 3 examined the effect of certain sequence types on ERPs in FESz (n =14) and normal controls (n = 14), in order to ascertain whether P300 and other ERP deficits in schizophrenia could be attributed to impairments on specific sequence occurrences. Specifically, effects from the discontinuation of a long series of repetitions (DR-series) and alternations (DA-series) were examined. In general, patients with FESz demonstrated similar ERPs to controls to the series examined.Study 4 demonstrated that the early (N100 and P200) component deficits to target and non-target stimuli were specific for FESz (n = 20), when compared to both a clinical (ADHD, n = 20) and normal (n = 20) control group. Finally, a stepwise discriminant function analysis (Dfa), demonstrated that measures derived from the early components had better sensitivity and specificity values (vs. N2, P3) for diagnostic classification when compared with ADHD.This thesis provides compelling evidence that N100 and P200 components to target and non-target stimuli are impaired in both the early and chronic manifestations of schizophrenia, and argues that, on account of the superior sensitivity and specificity values associated with the early components, they may serve as potentially useful biological markers for the disorder.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the expression profile of streptokinase</field><field name="creator">Shyam, Priya</field><field name="description">Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes invasive and non invasive infections in human skin and mucosal tissue. Since the mid-1980s, a conspicuous increase in the incidence and severity of invasive infections caused by GAS has been observed worldwide. S. pyogenes infections are endemic amongst many Aboriginal communities of Northern Australia. With rates of infection in these communities being amongst the highest in the world, there is an urgent need for identifying the key virulence factors involved in the initiation and progression of invasive GAS diseases. Streptokinase, a secreted group A streptococcal protein, activates host plasminogen converting it to the broad spectrum protease plasmin. Several plasmin(ogen) binding receptors present on the GAS cell surface facilitate the acquisition of cell surface plasmin activity. The gene encoding encoding streptokinase (ska) is present in all GAS isolates. In this study, allelic variants of ska have been characterised in various GAS isolates from the Northern Territory of Australia. The region encoding the &#65533; domain of ska in these isolates was sequenced and phylogenetically analysed to identify the specific allelic variant genotype for each isolate. Culture supernatants of these strains were examined for the presence of streptokinase and the cysteine protease, SpeB, via immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against these proteins. Two GAS strains (ALAB49 and 5448) and their isogenic ska and speB mutants were used to demonstrate the specificity and applicability of this technique for detecting the presence of streptokinase and SpeB in the culture supernatants. Using this methodology, streptokinase expression in culture supernatants of NT GAS isolates was investigated. Streptokinase was found to be expressed in mid-log, late-log and early stationary growth phases for all NT isolates examined in this study. It was also found that different ska alleles expressed streptokinase proteins of variable molecular weights. The streptokinase expressed by strains possessing alleles of ska 1 cluster (NS53, NS730 and NS931) and strains possessing alleles of ska 2a sub-cluster (NS696, 5448) express a 48 kDa streptokinase protein and strains possessing alleles of the ska 2b sub-cluster (NS13, ALAB49, NS88.2 and NS455) express a 50 kDa streptokinase protein. Culture supernatants from all GAS strains in early stationary growth phase were found to contain pro-SpeB (inactive precursor). Mature SpeB was only detected in the early stationary phase culture supernatants of strain NS53. Examples of the three known allelic ska variants were cloned from strains NS931, 5448 and ALAB49. DNA sequence analysis of these clones showed a high percentage of identity with previously published ska sequences. The recombinant plasmid pSka1 (containing the ska insert from NS931) was expressed and purified. The yield of the purified protein obtained was 1.16 mg/ml. Future work will determine the functional differences between the recombinant proteins expressed by these clones and it is hoped that this will help gain a better understanding of the role of the allelic variation of streptokinase in GAS disease virulence.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monetary policy transmission mechanism and structural breaks in Indonesia|</field><field name="creator">Afandi, Akhsyim</field><field name="description">This research studies the monetary policy transmission mechanisms in Indonesia. It aims at achieving six objectives. First, it investigates not only the channels associated with monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets but also those associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the goods market. Second, it assesses and compares the relative strength of each channel of monetary policy transmission, which has not been attempted previously in the case of the Indonesia. This attempt is made possible by the use of a single model to investigate the multiple channels of monetary policy transmission. Third, it examines whether the 1998 financial crisis has changed the course of each channel of monetary policy transmission. Specifically, whether the role played by each channel in the monetary policy transmission weakened or strengthened is investigated. Fourth, to achieve these objectives a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the Indonesian economy is constructed. However, before these objectives are addressed the issue of whether the monetary policy shocks have plausible macroeconomic effects is dealt with. To that end, a nonrecursive identifying strategy is applied. Likewise, the complexity of the actual monetary policy conduct in Indonesia that makes it hard to single out the monetary policy instruments actually in use in Indonesia is mitigated by devising eight SVAR specifications. Fifth, it addresses the issue of non-stationary data in VAR modelling by conducting unit root test that allows for one and two endogenouslydetermined breaks. Specifically, this study examines the robustness of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the presence of one and/or more structural breaks. Given the fact that most time series data have structural breaks, such an attempt has not been done in the case of Indonesia. Finally, it attempts to solve the identification problem associated with bank lending channel using cointegration procedures based on the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and the impulse response function analysis that have not been applied to an Indonesian case. (One advantage of the ARDL approach is that it is appropriate irrespective of whether the time series data used are integrated of degree one or zero). SVAR model specification that captures the most plausible effects of monetary policy shocks is selected out of eight specifications of the SVAR model of the Indonesian economy estimated using both monthly and quarterly data from 1984M12- 2003M12 (1984Q4-2003Q4). The eight different SVAR models are estimated out of the fact that in reality there are four potential measures of monetary aggregates: total reserves, base money, narrow money (M1) and broad money (M2) and two potential measures of short-term interest rates: interbank call-money rate (R1) and SBI rate (interest rate on Bank Indonesia bills) (R2) as monetary policy instruments.Based on the estimated impulse response analyses, the specification that best captures the effects of monetary policy shocks, as expected by theory, is selected. Overall, the monthly eight-variable SVAR specification that uses M2 as measure of monetary aggregate and R1 as short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. However, the quarterly version of the same specification is superior to all other specifications because it resolves the exchange rate puzzle (the initial depreciation of exchange rate following a monetary tightening). This model specification is used to empirically assess the relative strength of channels associated with the monetary-policyinduced changes in the financial and goods markets. In regards to the latter, it has shown empirically, relying on the concept of contribution derived from estimated SVAR models, that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary transmission mechanisms. This result is more in line with the findings regarding the United States than with those regarding the Europe and Japan. For the latter countries investment spending is predominant in the monetary transmission mechanisms. As for the channels associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets, this study finds that bank loans are dominant. The accumulated response of output attributed to this channel is stronger than the exchange rate and asset price channels. A monetary tightening shock leads to a fall in bank credit, with a lag of about three quarters. However, the importance of bank loans has been exaggerated by the credit crunch during the financial crisis period. The role of bank loans is weaker during the period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels. The finding on the bank lending channel suffers an identification problem: do the monetary-policy-induced movements in bank loans originate from the supply or demand side? The &#8220;credit view&#8221; of monetary policy transmission requires that the former is the case. The estimation of error correction models where the cointegating vectors allow for one structural break and are based on the Johansen&#8217;s and Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedures find that the former is the case. Further, the impulse response analysis based on both vector error correction (VEC) models of the bank loans market and the eight-variable SVAR corroborates this result irrespective of the origin of shock, monetary policy or otherwise. Likewise, the first requirement of the credit view that a monetary tightening by the central bank is capable of constraining the supply of bank loans is satisfied. Similarly, this analysis also satisfies the second requirement of the credit view that the monetary-induced decline in the supply of bank loans depresses aggregate spending due to the significance of the bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, the bank lending channel is confirmed. The exchange rate channel is found to be the weakest. The reason is that during and after the financial crisis there are anomalies associated with this channel. The exchange rate channel operates against the conventional wisdom. A monetary tightening shock is accompanied by exchange rate depreciation and subsequently weakening the level of economic activity. These anomalies disappear when the estimation covers observations before the financial crisis only. These anomalies are due to the fact that during the crisis period the exchange rate depreciation was so enormous that monetary policy tightening had little or no effect in arresting the depreciation pressure. Further, since Indonesia is a highly indebted economy the enormous exchange rate depreciation has inflated the foreign-currency-denominated debts and hence greatly worsened firms&#8217; balance sheets, thereby depressing firms&#8217; investment and productive capacity and hence the level of economic activity.As for the asset price channel, the results reveal that the equity price channel is also weaker than the bank loans channel but slightly stronger than the exchange rate channel. Due to the collapse of stock market and sharp decrease in the use of equity financing during the financial crisis period, the equity price channel of monetary policy transmission had weakened during that period. Further, to the extent that this channel follows Monetarist view or Tobin&#8217;s view, the latter seems to play a dominant role. That is, the real effect of this channel is mainly due to investment spending increases spurred by higher Tobin&#8217;s q resulting from the increase in stock price following a monetary easing. Finally, this study also confirms the occurrence of credit crunch following the financial crisis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The liquid-phase synthesis and electrochemical application of novel inorganic nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Zheng W</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to investigate various liquid-phase syntheses of novel inorganic nanocomposites for electrochemical power sources. Lithium ion batteries and fuel cells are two typical kinds of electrochemical power sources in the consumer electronics market. Lithium ion batteries are currently one of the most popular energy storage devices. Direct methanol fuel cells also have much potential as next generation electrochemical power sources, especially for small electronic devices.Tin and Pt based nanocomposites are two types of inorganic materials studied in this work for use as alternative electrodes, as lithium ion battery anodes and as direct methanol fuel cell electrocatalysts, respectively. Different liquid-phase synthesis methods were employed to prepare these novel nanocomposites. Physical and electrochemical characterizations were carried out systematically on the as-prepared nanocomposites.All of the results show that these novel inorganic nanocomposite materials are unique and good substitutes for the anode materials in lithium ion batteries or as electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/49</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the Philippines in the BIMP-EAGA growth triangle and the dynamics of ASEAN political economy</field><field name="creator">Elisabeth, Adriana</field><field name="description">The title of the dissertation is The Role of the Philippines in Growth Triangle and the Dynamics of ASEAN Political Economy. It looks into the role of the Philippines in establishing the first growth quadrangle in South East Asia or the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines - East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA or simply EAGA). There was no EAGA without Philippine enthusiastic in proposing the idea. EAGA became the first sub-regional economic cooperation to back up Philippine national development program; that is the Philippines 2000 and the NIC-hood vision. The establishment of EAGA represented Philippine foreign relations with regional countries, and the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) as the longest running regional association. The relevance of EAGA was in controversy. The affirmative perspective ensured that EAGA was built in economic term to promote trade, investment and tourism for the regional countries, which experienced similar historical of colonialism, and cultural and religious backgrounds. Some achievements have been made through many numbers of working groups&#8217; meetings, expositions and conferences since the EAGA formation in 1994 until now. On the other hand, the pessimistic perspective highlighted the negative impacts of the EAGA growth quadrangle. The failure of poverty eradication was one of the social impacts. EAGA seems to be more hopeless when indicated to problems, which exist at the national, regional and global levels and related each other. Crony capitalism, inter-religious conflicts and process of democracy are major domestic issues that have affected the EAGA business activities, besides the Asian Crisis in 1997. The practice of crony capitalism is related to domestic political culture and the influence of market orientation or economic liberalism. Global war against terrorism is another international factor, which affected regional political development. The future of EAGA is clearly dependent on to what extents member countries can cope with their domestic problems. Similar phenomenon happened with ASEAN in which its function as regional economic integration has been subordinated by the dominance of political disputes bilaterally and multilaterally.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/52</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solid-state refrigeration and power generation using semiconductor nanostructures</field><field name="creator">O'Dwyer, Mark F</field><field name="description">Solid-state nanostructure thermionic devices offer the potential of reliable and scalable refrigeration and power generation at high efficiencies. Theory is developed allowing the analysis of thermionic devices with arbitrary ballistic electron transmission. This is used to show that the nature of the energy spectrum of electrons transmitted in the device has a significant effect on the device performance. Electronic transport in multilayer and nanowire solid-state thermionic devices is considered in detail. Devices that select electrons for emission according to their total momentum, in contrast to conventional devices in which selection is based on longitudinal momentum only, are shown to be superior in a number of ways. While the efficiency of conventional devices is shown to be limited to values less than the Carnot value, total momentum filtered devices may achieve the Carnot efficiency. Total momentum filtered devices also have a more easily optimised electron energy spectrum and produce significantly higher currents than conventional devices. In any thermionic device it is shown that electronic efficiency is increased by transmitting a narrower range of electron energies and using a transmission probability that sharply rises to full transmission. Conditions for maximum power and efficiency with losses are also presented. It is shown that the formalisms used to describe thermionic and thermoelectric devices reduce to the same form when considered over distances around the electron mean free path. This implies that both have a similar dependence on the nature of the electron energy spectrum. Wide single-barriers are shown to give electron energy spectra that rise sharply. Analysis of a number of barrier potential profiles reveals that structures yielding electron reflection above the barrier are undesirable. It is suggested that short-period superlattice barriers, which may have reduced thermal conductivity for enhanced performance, might be the best barrier structure. These are analysed and it is discussed how they should be structured for good electronic transport.Equations for thermionic emission in heterostructure nanowires are derived and used to propose a correction to measurements of nanowire barrier heights. Calculations predict that, in principle, appropriately doped thin nanowires are capable of outperforming conventional thermionic devices. Quantum dot embedded nanowires are then considered and their energy levels discussed in detail. It is proposed that such a device may be used for a low-temperature proof-of-principle experiment to measure efficiency approaching the Carnot limit. Finally, it is shown that the electron energy spectrum principles developed apply to more than just solid-state thermionic devices by considering nanometre-gap vacuum thermionic refrigerators and hot carrier solar cells. The general principles explored in this thesis are therefore likely to be relevant to other energy conversion devices.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the coalface : identity implications of performance appraisal at an underground coal mine</field><field name="creator">McLean, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the reasons for negative employee responses to performance appraisal at an underground coal mine in Australia. Through analysis of processes of identity construction and defence among coal miners, the thesis advances understanding of how blue-collar employees react to receiving comparative performance ratings. Using an extended case study method over a five year period, the fieldwork investigated the discursive resources that miners used to make sense of this orthodox human resource management practice. By combining insights from critical discourse analysis and critical management studies approaches, the thesis analyses the effects of appraisal upon miners&#8217; occupational identity and provides empirical evidence of the inventive powers of such workers to prise open spaces for workplace resistance through identity (re)construction processes. A synthesis of conceptual frameworks pertaining to performance appraisal, discursive concepts, subjects and objects, and identity regulation and identity work, provides a more comprehensive understanding of employee responses to managerial initiatives such as performance appraisal. Miners used a palette of discursive resources, including storytelling and dissonance tropes to make sense of, and subvert, the negative effects of individuating performance appraisals on their occupational identity. The thesis questions the power neutral assumptions of mainstream human resource management practice, and suggests that managers who ignore the subjective effects of disciplining technologies such as appraisal may experience unintended consequences as workers resist identity disruptions in the workplace.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of blind signal separation for real time application</field><field name="creator">Smith, Daniel</field><field name="description">The &#8216;cocktail party problem&#8217; is the term commonly used to describe the perceptual problem experienced by a listener who attempts to focus upon a single speaker in a scene of interfering audio and noise sources. Blind Signal Separation (BSS) is a blind identification approach that can offer an adaptive, intelligent solution to the &#8216;cocktail party problem&#8217;. Audio signals can be blindly retrieved from the mixture, that is, without a priori knowledge of the audio signals or the location of the audio sources and sensors. Hence, BSS exhibits greater flexibility than other identification approaches, such as adaptive beamforming, which require precise knowledge of the sensors and/or signal locations.Speech enhancement is a potential application of BSS. In particular, BSS is potentially useful for the enhancement of speech in interactive voice technologies. However, interactive voice technologies, such as mobile telephony or  eleconferencing, require real time processing (on a frame-by-frame basis), as longer processing delays are considered intolerable for the participants of the two-way communication. Hence, BSS applications with interactive voice technologies require real-time operation of the algorithm.BSS primarily employs Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as the criteria to separate speech signals. Separation is achieved with ICA when statistical independence between the signal estimates is established. However, investigations in this Thesis, that study the relationship between the ICA criteria and speech signals indicate that significant statistical dependencies can exist between short frames of speech. Hence, it was found that the ICA criteria could be unreliable for real-time speech separation. This Thesis proposes a number of BSS algorithms that improve real-time separation performance in acoustic environments. In addition, these algorithms are shown to be better equipped to handle the dynamic nature of acoustic environments that contain moving speakers. The algorithms exhibit higher data efficiency, that is, these approaches accurately separate the acoustic scene with smaller amounts of data. The higher data efficiency is the result of BSS models that better represent the underlying characteristics of audio, and in particular speech in the mixture.Sparse Component Analysis (SCA) algorithms are proposed to exploit the sparse representation of audio in the time-frequency (t-f) domain. Conventional SCA approaches generally place strong constraints upon signals, requiring them to be highly sparse across their entire t-f representation. This constraint is not always satisfied by broadband audio, particularly speech, and hence separation performance is reduced. The SCA algorithms developed in this Thesis relax this constraint, such that signals can be estimated from sparse sub-regions of the t-f representation rather than the complete t-f representation. A SCA algorithm that employs K-means clustering of the t-f space is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of estimation. In addition, an exponential averaging function is used to reduce the influence of poor estimates when separation is performed on a frame by frame basis. Sequential approaches to SCA are proposed in this Thesis where only a sparse subregion of one signal in the mixture is required for estimation at one time. This relaxes the sparsity constraints that are placed upon broadband signals in the mixture.A BSS algorithm that jointly models the production mechanisms of speech (pitch and spectral envelope) is also presented in this Thesis. This produces a more accurate model of speech than existing algorithms that individuallymodel the pitch or spectral envelope. An investigation of this algorithm then determines the parameter set that optimally models the underlying speech signals in the mixture.Finally, an algorithm is proposed to exploit both the sparse t-f representation of audio and the joint model of speech production. This unified approach compares the SCA and speech production mechanism criteria, switching to the criteria that provides the most accurate estimate. Results indicate that this unified algorithm offers a superior data efficiency to its constituent algorithms, and to three benchmark ICA algorithms.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass spectrometric studies of non-covalent biomolecular complexes</field><field name="creator">Urathamakul, Thitima</field><field name="description">Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was employed to investigate non-covalent associations of macromolecules with ligands, metal ions and other macromolecules. Firstly, ESI-MS was used to examine the interactions of six ruthenium compounds with three different DNA sequences (D1, D2 and D3). The relative binding affinities of these ruthenium compounds towards dsDNA was determined to be: [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ . [Ru(phen)2(dpqMe2)]2+ &gt; [Ru(phen)2(dpqC)]2+ &gt; [Ru(phen)2(dpq)]2+ &gt;[Ru(phen)2(pda)]2+ &gt; [Ru(phen)3]2+. This order was in good agreement with that obtained from DNA melting temperature experiments. Competition experiments involving ruthenium compounds and organic drugs were also conducted to obtain information about the DNA binding modes of the ruthenium compounds. These studies provide strong support for the routine application of ESI-MS as a tool for analysis of non-covalent complexes between metallointercalators and dsDNA. ESI-MS also proved to be a rapid and efficient tool for investigation of interactions between the N-terminal domain of &#949; (&#949;186, the exonuclease proofreading subunit of E. coli DNA) and three different metal ions (Mn2+, Zn2+ and Dy3+). The dissociation constants (Kd) for binding of Mn2+, Zn2+ and Dy3+ to &#949;186 were determined from ESI-MS data to be 38.5 x 10-6, 3.7 x 10-6 and 2.0 x 10-6 M, respectively. Despite binding the least tightly to the protein, incorporation of Mn2+ into the enzyme resulted in the highest enzymatic activity as measured by spectrophotometric studies. This suggested that Mn2+ is possibly the native metal ion present in &#949;186. The ability of the metal ions to enhance &#949;186 enzymatic activity was found to follow the order: Mn2+ &gt;&gt; Zn2+ &gt; Dy3+. The results of these experiments also provided evidence that the presence of two divalent metal ions was essential for efficient enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis. The distribution of different oligomeric forms of wild-type E. coli DnaB helicase and DnaB helicase mutants (F102E, F102H, F102W and D82N) was examined using a factory-modified Q-ToF mass spectrometer equipped with a 32,000 m/z quadrupole. Previous experiments showed that the heptameric form of the wild-type protein was favoured in the presence of methanol (30% v/v). In the current work, mixtures of hexamer, heptamer, decamer and dodecamer were observed in solutions containing 1000 mM NH4OAc, 1 mM Mg2+ and 0.1 mM ATP, pH 7.6. When the proteins were prepared in solutions containing a lower concentration of Mg2+ (0.1 mM), only the hexameric form was observed for all proteins except D82N, which showed a mixture of hexamer and heptamer. These observations suggest that the higher order structures were stabilised at high concentrations of Mg2+. In addition, the hexamers of DnaB and mutants ((DnaB)6, (F102W)6 and (D82N )6) formed complexes with four to six molecules of the helicase loading partner, DnaC. ESI-MS was used in conjunction with hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies to probe the unfolding mechanisms of linear and cyclised DnaB-N (the N-terminal domain of DnaB helicase) containing linkers comprised of different numbers of amino acid residues (3, 4, 5 and 9). The unfolding rates for all the cyclised proteins were about ten-fold slower than for the corresponding linear proteins. These observations suggest that enhancement of protein stability against unfolding could be achieved through cyclisation. Furthermore, the HDX data showed that all the proteins examined exhibited a rare EX1 mechanism at near neutral pH.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management control systems in research and development organisations: A multiple case study in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Silaen, Parulian</field><field name="description">Research and Development organisations deal with different environments, purposes, goals, and employees characteristics compared to non-Research and Development organisations. Research and Development (R&amp;D) activity is a learning process that makes the R&amp;D units deal with relatively uncertain conditions in conducting their tasks. The R&amp;D activity is a non-repetitive task with a purpose to contribute new knowledge whether or not it has specific commercial objectives. Such a situation makes the goals relatively difficult to measure quantitatively and monetarily. This thesis is built on the thrust of those characteristics of R&amp;D organisations and uses a descriptive case study research strategy to conduct an investigation into how management control systems are applied in public sector R&amp;D organisations in Indonesia and why such practices are chosen. This thesis develops a framework that consists of four core elements of management control systems that need to be considered in setting the control function. The framework is used to explain how and why such practice was implemented. This thesis also involves the historical background of Indonesia from its colonial past to the present. The study has no intention to generalise its finding, rather it hopes to make a contribution to the body of knowledge and practice, with its consideration of the four core elements involved in setting management control systems. The four core control elements are Desired Ends, Actors, Control Implementation, and Control Tools. The Desired Ends consists of two sub-elements namely Yardstick and Direction. The Actors consists of five sub-elements; Behavioural, Motivational, Domination, Power, and Decision Space. The Control Implementation contains two sub-elements; Control Types and Timing, in which the Control Types consists of Formal and Informal types, and Timing of implementation contains three stages as Input, Process and Output. The practice of management control systems in Indonesia was found to be an archaic and centralised system. Centralisation of control was found to be placed in the central government offices in Jakarta. Such practice may be influenced by several factors including historical, political, and cultural as well as the nature of the R&amp;D activities. In addition, the management control systems applied were found to be both formal and informal during the input, process and output stages. The control tools practiced by the controller were found to be directional, bureaucratic, and mostly emphasised the financial dimension. The use of the scientific dimension was only found to be used during a seminar presentation. This thesis contributes to the body of knowledge particularly in the area of management control systems by showing how and why such practices of management control system exist in the government sector in Indonesia. The conclusion of this thesis is that there is a need to consider the core control elements simultaneously in designing a management control systems particularly for a research and development organisation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being an educated woman: a phenomenological exploration</field><field name="creator">Sharma-Brymer, Vinathe</field><field name="description">This study explores ten Indian women's experience of 'being an educated woman.' These ten women have a bachelor's degree and hail from Bangalore city in India. The social phenomenon of being an educated person is a positive notion in postcolonial, Indian society. Girls' and women's education is regarded as important for their family and for the nation's progress. Academic research on asking educated women what do they think of themselves as being educated is hardly evident. The value of this thesis lies in its explorative phenomenological framework used to document the participants' narratives of their experience. It also highlights the researcher's lived experience, using insider/outsider perspective. Applying a broad interpretive phenomenological approach this study provides an alternative framework of reflection, interpretation and analysis of the space in their lived experience. It also draws from educational theory, human development models and feminist research for a richer understanding of women, education and development area. Data sources of this study include in-depth interviews, academic and non-academic literature and stories. The stages of interpreting the data included immediate reflections following the interviews, identification from the transcripts of thematic layers, and three layers of interpretation. In this three-stage process the participants' texts were analysed in depth through active listening, repeated reading of the transcripts, researcher's bracketed reflections, and layers of thematic interpretation - to illuminate the complexity of 'going back to the things themselves.' Layers of interpretation revealed a 'torn-between' experience, an experience of tensions, conflict and contradiction both in the public and private spheres of life. It was an interplay on the continuum of an educated woman becoming a 'confident ideal' as well as living as a 'social ideal.' The contradiction illuminated a site of desire and threat related to change and action. Through the analysis of this experience the thesis builds a theoretical construct to describe the space that can be created in educated women's lives, one which they are required to negotiate constantly. This construct is the Actionable Space (AS), which locates educated women's lived experience in the 'third space' between awareness of self-efficacy and awareness of social conformity leading to their tensions and conflicts. This critical space creates hope and the beginnings of a new direction in understanding the experience of being an educated woman. This research provides the personal practical and collective knowledge of the experience for the public. It is essential that teachers' training workshops, and parent and community education incorporates this knowledge to initiate a positive change in girls' and women's education. It needs to be included in all situations where female agency is discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of accounting systems in decision making, planning and control in a developing country: the case of Libya</field><field name="creator">Shareia, Bubaker</field><field name="description">This study examines the present and potential role of accounting information systems in meeting the development needs of developing countries, with a special focus on Libya and its unique legal, economic, religious, political and social context. A contextualised study, it uses the economic development Theory of Globalisation in order to interpret the data, with particular emphasis on social and cultural factors determine economic condition, communication and its significance in global world and greater technological unification, including globalised accounting. Within the Libyan context, an ideographic methodology is used to develop two case studies. One organisation is examined as a provider of information (General Company for Pipelines), and another, the Industry Secretariat, as a user/ stakeholder organisation. A variety of data collection methods is used, including semi-structured interviews, observations, a small structured questionnaire and document analysis in order to make data triangulation possible. Libya is a developing country with significant differences from developed countries, including the way it makes use of accounting information. At present the accounting profession does not play a vital role in the economic development of the country and current accounting practices are based mainly on government legislation rather than planning and decision-making. This study illustrates the possibility, and even the necessity, for accounting to play a significant role in the development of Libya and other developing countries. Whilst this study demonstrates the importance of an awareness of cultural context in the role of accounting systems, it has focused only on one country, Libya, and two organisations within that country. Consequently, even though developing countries have many similarities, the generalisibility of this study is limited. Wider research of other contexts within Libya and beyond is needed to illuminate further the influence of social and cultural factors, communication and greater technological unification on the practice of accounting. It would be useful to replicate the study in other organisations within Libya and in other developing countries. The use of an economic development theory, while revelatory at one level, limits the interpretation of data. A different theoretical approach, or different research methods, for example, a larger style of survey or a different kind of qualitative study, could provide different or additional insights. This study helps to increase awareness of the role of accounting and its potential contribution to economic development at the macro and micro levels and is a starting point for making a difference in developing countries. It provides a contribution to practical knowledge of the role of accounting in developing countries with special reference to Libya, by identifying issues in the Libyan environment, acknowledging the present of powerful global influences, and pointing the way forward to use accounting in a more significant way. Most previous research in this area has focussed on the suitability of accounting systems in meeting development needs, with little attention being paid to addressing how these systems can be made more useful in decision-making, planning and control. This study acknowledges that the challenge for developing countries, such as Libya, in adopting globalised accounting systems, is to adapt them successfully to their own regulatory, legal, political, cultural and religious setting. This has to be accomplished while still achieving the production and effective use of timely, relevant and accurate accounting information in order to serve the country&#65533;s development needs. An assessment of the factors influencing the development and use of accounting systems in developing countries such as Libya is a necessary starting point for achieving these goals. This study provides such an assessment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques for estimating impervious surface cover in hydrologic modelling</field><field name="creator">Roso, Steven</field><field name="description">Due to their low infiltration rates, impervious surfaces generate large amounts of runoff. This runoff usually has high concentrations of pollutants. The impervious surface cover on a catchment therefore has a significant effect on catchment hydrology and water quality. This makes estimates of impervious surfaces critical when preparing hydrologic models of urban catchments. It could be expected that such measurements would be relatively straightforward since, unlike many other parameters used in hydrologic modeling, impervious surfaces are both directly observable and easily interpreted. However, to date measurements have relied on simple human based techniques which have limitations. Engineering research on improvement in impervious cover estimation has been limited, since the extent of impervious cover is best measured through use of a suite of spatial analysis tools that has not to date formed part of an engineer's core skill-set. In addition, remotely sensed imagery, as well as computing power, suitable for such measurement has only recently become readily available. This thesis investigates both the accuracy of impervious surface cover estimation, and the resulting effect on hydrologic predictions. For this study seven methods for impervious surface cover measurement were assessed. These include a range of human based methods and automated computer based methods applied using LiDAR, high resolution aerial photography, and multi-spectral satellite imagery. The accuracy of these methods was validated for a 925 ha semi-urban catchment located near the city of Shellharbour, NSW, Australia. The study found that the most reliable method for impervious cover estimation was Method 7 involving the use of high resolution satellite imagery and vegetation index analysis. Furthermore, it was found that the accuracy of most methods is dependent on the size of the sample considered and the type of dominant land cover. Whilst Method 7 was found to be overall the most accurate method, ultimately method selection will depend on other factors including available data, software and user skill level. As a second part of the study, the hydrologic sensitivity to accurate impervious surface measurement was then assessed for the study catchment. This involved a sensitivity analysis using two hydrologic models, an event based hydrology model (WBNM) and a continuous simulation water quality model (MUSIC). Hydrologic sensitivity was found to be significant where the modeled conditions involved low rainfall events on catchments with high infiltration. Under these conditions it was found that hydrologic estimates have a typical 25% error due to error in underlying impervious cover estimates. This is in addition to other sources of error and highlights the need for accurate impervious cover estimation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and synthesis of chiral ligands for use in stereoselective atropisomeric biaryl coupling reactions</field><field name="creator">Gresser, Mary J</field><field name="description">A new chiral ligand design program was initiated for the stereoselective synthesis of sterically hindered systems, such as atropisomeric biaryls. The concept of helical-sense discrimination was investigated, for use in the Pd-based Suzuki coupling reaction. A new set of design principles was established for chiral ligands for use in these reactions; 1) the ligand must contain a defined helical twist enclosed at each end by donor atoms, 2) the ligand must be bidentate, to best transfer the helical aspect of the ligand to the Pd reaction site, 3) the substituents of the donor atoms should be tied back in ring systems to prevent steric hindrance of the already sterically demanding reaction site and 4) the helical twist should be in close proximity to the Pd reaction site. The first two target scaffolds which would incorporate the above principles were chiral 2,2&#65533;-bispyrrolidine and 2,2&#65533;-bisindoline. A new synthetic strategy was devised, which provided both enantiomers of 2,2&#65533;- bispyrrolidine and was modified to access 2,2&#65533;-bisindoline. The key steps of the synthesis were the metathesis dimerisation and subsequent Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) from achiral starting materials. (R,R)-N,N&#65533;-Di-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2,2&#65533;-bispyrrolidine 92a was synthesised in 13% yield, over 10 steps, from commercially available 4-penten-1-ol. The metathesis reaction gave the desired benzyl protected alkene as a mixture of geometric isomers (4:1), which were dihydroxylated using AD mix &#65533;&#65533; and standard Sharpless conditions to give the corresponding diol with an ee of 80%. The procedure was repeated using the PMB protected derivatives to give (R,R)-92a in overall 9% yield, with the AD reaction using AD mix &#65533;&#65533; giving the diol in 92% ee. The procedure was repeated using AD mix &#65533;&#65533;, which gave the enantiomeric 2,2&#65533;- bispyrrolidine (S,S)-92b in 24% overall yield and 88% ee. The synthetic strategy was applied towards the synthesis of chiral 2,2&#65533;-bisindoline, for which there is no literature precedent. Benzyl protected 2-allylphenol was dimerised via the metathesis reaction using Grubbs 1st generation catalyst, to give the dimeric aromatic allylic alkene in 81% yield (E:Z 5.2:1). The geometric ratio could be improved to 9:1 via recrystallisation from DCM/hexanes. Grubbs 2nd generation catalyst was found to increase the geometric ratio, however the alkene could not be separated from the secondary metathesis products. The alkene was dihydroxylated using AD mix &#65533;&#65533; in 15% yield and 64% ee. The yield was increased to 60% by using modified Sharpless conditions, however the enantiopurity decreased to 36% ee. The poor outcome of the AD reaction lead to extensive investigations into the Sharpless AD reaction via the modification of the ortho substituent of dimeric aromatic allylic alkenes. A variety of dimeric, heterodimeric and monomeric alkenes were synthesised, including seven phenolic based and two nitrogen based dimeric alkenes, via the metathesis reaction using both Grubbs 1st and 2nd generation catalysts. The alkenes were subsequently dihydroxylated using AD mix &#65533;&#65533; and AD mix &#65533;&#65533;. The diols were formed in poor yield (0% to 58%) and poor enantioselectivity (1% to 58%). The AD reaction of the ortho-tolyl derivative increased the yield (45-65%) and the ee (62-70%) while the unsubstituted derivative gave the corresponding diol in 84-88% yield with excellent stereocontrol (93-95% ee). It was therefore concluded that the presence of ortho-substituents in the aromatic rings of dimeric allylic aromatic alkenes prevented access of the substrate to the ligand bound OsO4, thereby minimising chemical yield and enantioselection.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on undeniable signatures and their variants</field><field name="creator">Huang, Xinyi</field><field name="description">In an ordinary digital signature scheme, the verification of a signature requires the associated message, the signer&#8217;s public key and other public information (e.g. public parameter). Anyone in the system can verify the validity of the digital signature. This property is useful, as it has many applications. However, it is undesirable for some situations where signer&#8217;s privacy is a concern, especially in personally and commercially sensitive applications. In this thesis, we investigate several special signature schemes that accommodate the signer privacy.In undeniable signatures, the most distinctive feature is that the signer is able to choose who can be convinced about his/her undeniable signature, as the validity of an undeniable signature can only be verified in collaboration with the signer. The property selective convertibility enables the signer to convert one or more undeniable signatures into ordinary digital signatures at some time later, while one can make all his/her undeniable signatures publicly verifiable in an undeniable signature scheme with universal convertibility. Undeniable signatures with selective and universal convertibility have found many applications in practice such as keeping digital records of confidential political decisions. However, the most known constructions bear a long signature length and some schemes can only be proven secure under strong complexity assumptions. In this thesis, we describe a new undeniable signature scheme with selective and universal convertibility, of which the signature length is the shortest among all comparable ones and the security can be reduced to weaker complexity assumptions. This scheme is considered in the traditional public key infrastructure, where the authenticity of a user&#8217;s public key is ensured by certificates. We also provide the first selectively and universally convertible undeniable signature scheme where a user&#8217;s public key is his/her identity.Designated verifier signatures bridge the gap between ordinary digital signatures and undeniable signatures, in the sense that they will limit who can be convinced by the signer&#8217;s signature without any collaboration with the signer. The designated verifier can be chosen by the signer in the generation of designated verifier signatures. Although the verification of a designated verifier signature usually needs only public information, only the designated verifier can believe that the designated verifier signature has been generated by the signer. This is due to the fact that the designated verifier is able to generate designated verifier signatures which are indistinguishable from those produced by the signer. Strong designated verifier signatures provide a higher level of privacy, as anyone cannot even verify the validity of strong designated verifier signatures with public information. All known constructions of strong designated verifier signatures have a relatively long signature length and require costly operations, which affect the overall performance of the system. In this thesis, we present two new constructions of strong designated verifier signatures, in traditional public key infrastructure and in identity-based cryptography, respectively. Both schemes have high computational efficiency, short signature length and provable security in the random oracle model.We finally consider universal designated verifier signatures, which can be viewed as an application of the general idea of designated verifier signatures. This notion was introduced to address the user privacy issue in certification systems, where a certificate holder (or more generally, a signature holder) wishes to generate a proof which can prove to a designated verifier his/her possession of the certificate, but does not want anyone else to be convinced. Universal designated verifier signatures achieve this by giving the designated verifier the full ability to generate that proof. The conviction thus is no longer transferable. In this thesis, we revise the notion of non-transferability in universal designated verifier signatures and give a new definition, which is meaningful both in theory and in practice. Our analysis, however, shows that not all existing schemes have that property. We describe a new universal designated verifier signature scheme, which can be proven secure without random oracles and has the property of non-transferability defined in this thesis. This thesis also investigates another property &#8220;delegatability&#8221;, which was previously believed as an inherent flaw in universal designated verifier signatures. We show that this problem can be overcome by proposing the first universal designated verifier signature scheme without delegatability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developments in microdosimetry and nanodosimetry for space and therapeutic applications</field><field name="creator">Wroe, Andrew J</field><field name="description">This thesis further applies solid-state microdosimetry and low-pressure gas nanodosimetry to both radiation therapy and radiation protection. A number of unique applications have been identified where considerable advancements could be made with current technology and consequently have a significant bearing on developments in these fields.Silicon-on-Insulator (SOl) microdosimetry technology was utilised to provide a complete and detailed analysis of out-of-field dose equivalents for proton therapy. The superior device spatial resolution and established quality factors of the microdosimetry method allowed for a new perspective on this issue. Microdosimetric measurements within heterogeneous tissue equivalent phantoms were also completed to discern measurable changes in radiation field as a function of preceding phantom material and if such changes should be included in treatment planning calculations. These measurements were correlated with Monte Carlo simulations for experimental validation and further analysis oftreatment planning parameters.The application of SOl microdosimetry to space radiation was also tested with an experimental and theoretical analysis. Experimentally the devices were tested within homogeneous Perspex phantoms irradiated with a range of heavy ions including iron, titanium and oxygen. The microdosimetric parameters of these fields and the ability of the SOl microdosimeter to be applied in such fields was evaluated and established. This was further supported through theoretical simulations of the SOl  icrodosimeters response to solar protons prior to their deployment aboard the MidSTAR-I satellite. It is expected that such devices will make a valuable contribution evaluating the complex radiation field in space while at the same time establishing improvements for the next generation of devices.A new monolithic silicon AE-E telescope was evaluated in hadron therapy applications, obtaining data for both modulated and un-modulated therapeutic proton beams. This detector system provides two-dimensional information on LET and particle identification that is based on energy depositions, collected in coincidence, within the AE and E stages of the detector. This apparatus is advantageous over existing systems, that provide one-dimensional information on the lineal energy or LET spectra, as it allows for particles of differing type yet the same LET to be identified separately and the corresponding difference in both energy deposition properties and biological effect accounted for. To achieve this, a correlation matrix based on established in-vitro biology data was developed and verified to link the output of such a device directly to in-vitro radiobiological effect. This system has great application to both hadron therapy and radiation protection as it may provide a means for accurate real time analysis of the radiobiological properties of a complex mixed radiation field. It could be expected that such a system may form the basis of radiobiological treatment planning in hadron therapy.Nanodosimetry is the next logical extension from microdosimetry, providing information on radiation track structure at a DNA or nanometre level which is dependant on particle type and energy. Experimental results were obtained for a range of proton energies and the results compared with Monte Carlo simulation codes in an effort to both validate these codes and evaluate the performance ofthe low-pressure gas nanodosimeter. The initial development of a biophysical model in nanodosimetry was also presented, which will be further developed in future work. A requirement for such development is accurate biological data for low energy ion radiations. To this end cell survival work was completed on a human glioma cell line for a range of proton energies and Co-60 control with the development of a thin-film cell survival protocol. It is expected that the expansion of this radiobiology protocol will allow for the further correlation of cell survival with AE-E telescope and nanodosimetry output. Such correlation and biophysical model development is useful in hadron therapy treatment planning and radiation protection applications as it directly links a measured physical quantity to biological effect through models that are based on accurate experimental data.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/58</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of novel spirocyclic heterocycles as potential cancer therapeutics targeting the cell-cycle</field><field name="creator">Yong, Sarah Rebecca</field><field name="description">The spirocyclic ring structure is a feature of a number of naturally-occurring and synthetic products that possess interesting biologically activities. This thesis describes our efforts towards synthesising various spirocyclic heterocycles as potential cancer therapeutics targeting the cell-cycle. Three different spirocyclic scaffolds, A-C, were accessed through a variety of cycloaddition reactions and several of these were investigated for their cytostaticity and protein-inhibition properties. To gain further insights into the development of novel CDK2 inhibitors, part of this research was conducted at the Anti-Cancer Drug Design Initiative (ADDI) laboratory, University of Newcastle upon the Tyne, UK. This thesis is divided into three primary synthetic chemistry chapters, based upon discussion surrounding the main chemistries used to derive the various spirocyclic oxindole scaffolds of the types A-C. Chapter 2 describes the use of the phosphine-catalysed [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction to synthesise racemic and enantio-enriched versions of spirocycles of type A. Chapter 3 describes the use of the cyclopropanation reaction to synthesise spirocycles of type B. Lastly, Chapter 4 describes the employment of the [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of nitrones to the synthesis of spirocycles of type C. A discussion on the CDK2 research, performed in the UK, towards a new synthetic strategy employing directed ortho metalation chemistry is then provided in Chapter 5. The cellular cytostaticity screening against the cancer cell lines, H460, MCF-7 and SF-268, and protein inhibition studies against the cell-cycle proteins CDK2, CDK5, gSK-3 and MDM2, for a range of the spirocycles synthesised in Chapters 2-4, is then given and discussed in Chapter 6. Final conclusions and future work are drawn together in Chapter 7. All synthetic methods and physical and spectroscopic data are provided for all compounds in Chapter 8. Lastly, an appendix including all X-ray crystal structures and their crystallographic data, and also a section on the biological testing procedures is provided.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Text manipulation: voice with audio or acoustic augmentation.</field><field name="creator">Suiter, Wendy</field><field name="description">I have chosen text-based music as the avenue to create music that is meaningful to both audience and composer. I conducted substantial research into models of musical communication that revealed that these models lack clarity in the way they predict meaning, and make assumptions that cannot be generalised to all music. The development of an overarching model requires more work than possible in this document. Consideration has been given to making music from sampled, complex, autonomously produced, environmental sounds, since these sounds also carry representative meanings, as well as being sources of interesting timbres that evolve over time. However, the techniques and methodology are still being explored. A recurring issue is the capacity of particular software to do particular tasks, and the amount of time it takes to learn how to do complex functions with the software. Some of the works in the folio are studies in these techniques. Much of the music in the folio uses some algorithmic generation of materials. These were often found to be lacking in expressive capacity, thus requiring some creative intervention on the part of the composer. Further work needs to be done on expressiveness in music and how this can be applied to computer music, particularly those works generated by algorithmic means. Ultimately the folio contains a number of text-based works written in both the audio and acoustic domains. The compositional concepts useful across both these domains have been compared and explored.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Separate but equal? The enduring appeal of the single-sex public high schools of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Mueller, Fiona Jane</field><field name="description">During the 1960s the government of New South Wales adopted a comprehensive, coeducational model of schooling. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s dozens of boys' and girls' public schools were closed, amalgamated or restructured as a result of new policy commitments to equality of opportunity in education. Forty-six single-sex high schools remain in the public provision today, less than half the original number. Of these, twenty-four are girls' schools and twenty-two admit only boys. While one boys' school is located in a northern region of the state, the other forty-five are all to be found in the Sydney metropolitan area. The single-sex public high school provision in New South Wales constitutes an Australian educational phenomenon. However, despite the unique nature and extent of this provision in contemporary Australian public education, the schools attract little mention in the research literature. Likewise, official education publications, particularly those intended for consumers, provide few references to the single-sex option. In this thesis, evidence is provided of the incomplete implementation of policies favouring the coeducational, comprehensive model. The contention is that this reflects an unresolved ideological tension between those who believe that educational equity can only be delivered through identical provision and those who maintain that segregation of the sexes can enable a more effective focus on the needs of male and female students, both during secondary school and in preparation for the post-school world. This project focuses on the surviving New South Wales single-sex public high schools as a group left out of contemporary educational discourse. In seeking to understand their enduring appeal for consumers, the following key questions guided the research: - Which schools are they? - What sustains them? - How do the schools fit into the provision of public education? - What does the future look like for these schools? A wide range of historical and contemporary informants, including former Ministers for Education, senior bureaucrats and retired principals, together with participants from nine single-sex public high schools, provided comprehensive data to answer these questions. In the absence of a policy discourse that engages with the single-sex public school option, this study examines the characteristics of these institutions, the basis for their enduring appeal to consumers, and the strategies used by some to distinguish themselves in a highly competitive education market.

This system was calibrated and the minimum spot size produced by the LASER on the sample surface and its relation with sample position adjustment experimentally, was determined. Applying this chamber, a technique for controlled generation of particulate by LASER ablation has been developed. The sampling was carried out in four different atmospheres; Air, CO2, Stainshield 66, and Argoshield 52. Furthermore, to survey and analyse the fume particle size range, Scion Image software was applied. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy were chosen for analysis of fume particles morphology and size distribution. Energy Dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) were also chosen for chemical analysis. The average fume particle size observed in all atmospheres was less than 0.1 micrometer. Considering the effect of oxidation potential of shielding gases, CO2 generated the largest fume particles compared to Ar, while adding H2 led to a smaller particles size. The agglomeration pattern and morphology of fume particles was analysed as well. The survey of the agglomerated fume particles morphology with the SEM is more reliable since the TEM sample preparation could disturb the agglomeration pattern. Fume particles agglomeration tended to grow three dimensionally while ferrous compound tended to make network and agglomerate together. The fume particles in the same size range tended to agglomerate in a 'chain' pattern which could grow up to 10 micrometers. The population of agglomerated particles with different sizes together varied between 3 and 400 particles. One of the most common patterns of these agglomerations is 'spherical' pattern. While the fume particles can be in 'faceted' or 'spherical' shape, fume particles observed in this work were mainly 'faceted', independent of applied atmosphere. The chemical composition of fume particles is variable of target (the sample) composition. In this work Fe, Mn, Si and O2 were the elements observed in fume particles composition, while the elements found in the fume particles did not vary in different atmospheres. It is also proposed that future works follow the investigation of the size distribution and morphology of fume particles while different welding electrodes are targeted by LASER and atmosphere is purged with shielding gases.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work-related learning with the arts: developing work skills with the performing and visual arts</field><field name="creator">Manning, Claire</field><field name="description">the last decade there has been a trend to incorporate the arts into work-related learning. The purpose of this study was to explore work-related learning utilising the arts to determine the benefits of this approach to learning. This study was designed to investigate how work related learners, predominately adult learners, could benefit from learning with artistic processes.This study contributes to the body of knowledge and current limited research available on learning with the arts for work related development. Qualitative research was conducted in two arts environments, visual and performing, that offered work-related learning opportunities. This was undertaken using case study design where nine cases provided a snapshot of what was experienced when involved in work-related learning experiences.An analysis of nine participants&#8217; perceptions of learning with the arts was undertaken firstly by exploring the individual learning from the personal, sociocultural and physical perspective using the Contextual Model of Learning developed by Falk and Dierking (2000). Secondly, to discover the potential of learning with the arts for work related skill development an analysis of the participants&#8217; reflections describing what was gained in these arts learning environments were analysed using the Employability Skills Framework (DEST, 2002).Significant benefits for the individual adult learner are explored as a result of this study. For the workplace, this research presented evidence, based on participant perceptions, that employability skills could be developed when learning with the arts. Such skills identified during this study included assistance in the development of communication, initiative and enterprise, teamwork, self-management and lifelong learning skills.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human aspects of quality management in developing countries: a case study and model development for Thai manufacturing SMEs</field><field name="creator">Buranajarukorn, Panu</field><field name="description">Thai manufacturing SMEs have played a major role in increasing the Thai GDP and improving international competitiveness. However, there have been many problems inside organisations that have created obstacles to improving performance in both domestic and international markets. Thailand has entered into FTAs with several international trading groups, and has thus been confronted by fierce overseas competitors. However, Thai manufacturing SMEs have lacked investment in modern technology and management techniques. There appears to be a need for Quality Management (QM) that benefits from well-managed Human Factors (HFs). Over the past decade, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been used by many larger Thai enterprises, but there has been a slow up-take in Thai manufacturing SMEs. This PhD work has studied 71 Thai manufacturing SMEs in relation to Human Factors - dependent Quality Management Systems (QMSs). These were in three distinct industry groups; Food and Beverage, Automotive and Auto parts, and Textiles and Garments. In a substantial literature review, 300 references have been consulted. This review showed that management issues were critical in Thai manufacturing SME&#8217;s. Quality Management in particular is largely problematical and a better understanding of the role of human factors is urgently required. Human Factors considered are derived from the seven criteria of the Thailand Quality Award (TQA) and were used as the basis of a questionnaire survey. These were:- Strategic Human Resource Planning, Human Resource Development, Employee Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication and Information Management, Leadership, and Continuous Improvement . In analysing the results of the investigation, ten hypotheses were explored. The most important conclusions were:- &#8226; The importance of human factors problems in Thai manufacturing SMEs is significant (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; Thai manufacturing SMEs that had implemented TQM had established Organisational Aspects, Performance Management, Leadership and QM training that are different to those that had not implemented TQM. (&#8733; = 0.05). &#8226; The level of TQM adoption is not significantly related to the need to upgrade organisational performance, morale, work satisfaction, and work participation. There are significant relationships between morale and work satisfaction (&#945; = 0.05) and work participation and work satisfaction (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; The extent of human factors problems in Food and Beverage industries is significantly different from other industries (&#945; = 0.10). &#8226; Technology-intensive Thai manufacturing SMEs have more highly developed quality management than those that are Labour-intensive (&#945; = 0.01) and also established better performance management systems (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; The outcomes of this research relating to the current status of TQM implementation are useful for Thai manufacturing SMEs considering their problems because their interest in the results of this study was up to 72% (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; Government assistance programmes were considered by many Thai manufacturing SMEs to be unproductive. Less than 70% of Thai manufacturing SMEs had requested help from government to solve their human factors problems (&#945; = 0.05). In addition, there were perceived gaps between their needs and their conscious need for government assistance (&#945; = 0.05). Therefore, a new approach is required to fill this gap by establishing a productive quality management system. A SWOT analysis was used to identify Strengths and Weaknesses and examine Opportunities and Threats to Thai manufacturing SMEs. It concluded that Thai manufacturing SMEs should consider Human Factors as a major issue in establishing an effective Quality Management System. Three models were developed in this study. The first addresses the main five problems; Quality Practices, Human Resources, Management Functions and Operational Tasks, Basic Infrastructure and Organisational Aspects, and Related Problems which influenced the successful implementation of QM. In response to these, the two other models, Government Assistance Strategies and the Development of a Quality Management System specifically addressing the Human Resource in Thai manufacturing SMEs, have been established. It is concluded that government assistance strategies are necessary to assist Thai manufacturing SMEs in five areas; (1) Communication, Information and Education, (2) Provision of Effective SME Development programmes, (3) Improvement of Work Systems, (4) Establishment of Basic Infrastructure, and (5) Development of Quality Management Systems. Finally, it is emphasised that QMS Development needs to be integrated with HR Development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the directive genre in the Japanese and Australian workplace: a systemic functional approach</field><field name="creator">Mizusawa, Yumiko</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with how tenor relations impact on the language of the workplace, particularly as the workplace is typically organised hierarchically (Iedema, 1995) and is concerned with getting things done. In other words, the workplace is about administrative practices of guidance, surveillance and compliance (Iedema, 1995). In most cases, these social acts of guidance, surveillance and compliance are realised by discursive practices or workplace genres. Specifically, this study investigates the discursive practices of compliance, known as Directives, with a view to understanding the effect tenor relations have on the language choices of workers in Japan and Australia. The effect is described by using the tools of systemic functional grammar, particularly from the perspective of the interpersonal metafunction. The two corpora are analysed from &#8216;around&#8217; (the lexicogrammar) and from &#8216;above&#8217;, (the semantics). The results show that, while the language and meanings of Directives in both languages are highly sensitive to tenor relations, the nature of this sensitivity differs. In general terms, in the workplace, it seems that the Japanese language is more interpersonally oriented, while English is less so, with a tendency to be rather more ideationally oriented. The results go some way to supplying linguistic evidence for the claim that Japanese society in general is hierarchical (Nakane, 1970), while Australian society is less so.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'legalisation' of education : a study of New South Wales teachers and their professional development needs in the area of law</field><field name="creator">Newlyn, David J</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the legal knowledge held by teachers of New South Wales Government schools and the need for continued professional development in this area. The study commenced in 1997 and primary research concluded in 2000. The Australian experience seems to be mirroring international experiences, particularly those of the United States of America, which have seen an increase in the legalisation of the field of education. From this increase there emerged a need for a systematic programme of instruction to address the problem of a lack of legal knowledge held by teachers in order to adequately perform their professional duties as teachers and protect themselves and their employer from potential legal liabilities.The main purposes of this study were to determine the degree of legal knowledge that teachers in the State of New South Wales possessed, the need for the development of a course of instruction to address the perceived problem of a lack of legal knowledge and to investigate the methods available to address this problem. The study then proceeded to develop and trial a systematic curriculum designed to provide a background for teachers to education and the law.This was a multimethod ethnographic exploratory study that integrated aspects of both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. An initial focus group interview schedule was developed and then trialled with a group of teachers in order to gauge their experiences and knowledge of the law. This interview schedule was then refined and trialled with a larger sample of teachers drawn from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. From those focus groups there emerged clear evidence that the majority of teachers lacked knowledge of the law as it affected the performance of their professional teaching duties. What legal knowledge teachers did possess was often based on myth or misunderstanding.Therefore there emerged a need to canvas the views of the dominate stakeholders in the field of education to gain their interest/views on developing a course of legal instruction devised to address this problem. Additionally the question of which elements of the law would be necessary in such a course was also addressed. To this end the views of the teachers, their union and their government employer were all engaged. It became clear that there was general support, particularly high amongst the teachers, for the need for such a course of instruction.This study then moved on to develop a course of instruction which could be used at either the pre or post service levels of teacher professional development. The study examined a number of potential models of curriculum and the conclusion was reached that no single model of curriculum could be used to devise a successful and progressive course. Instead the curriculum devised was based upon a hybrid model using elements from the process and dynamic models of curriculum. This curriculum was then trialled with a sample of teachers. At the end of the trial, course participants were asked to complete a brief survey and their comments were reported to show that the majority believed they had engaged in a positively rewarding experience, which made them more aware of how the law was a pervasive influence on their teaching.Overall the findings indicate that there is a definite need for pre service and practising teachers to have a degree of legal knowledge which is provided in a professional manner. There is broad support for such a course of instruction amongst the teaching profession and its dominant union body. Unfortunately there was not the same degree of enthusiasm shown by the government employer.The study concludes with a statement that there needs to be a unilateral effort between the teachers, their union and their employer towards a common goal of instructing teachers about the law if such a course of instruction is to gain credibility and acceptance amongst the members of the teaching profession.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">State-society interaction and the survival of the state: the case of Papua New Guinea and Japan</field><field name="creator">Monden, Kazuhiro</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with questions of how state-society interactions of two different states, a weak state &#8211; Papua New Guinea &#8211; and a strong state &#8211; Japan &#8211; have influenced responses to their respective internal and external challenges, particularly those caused by the anarchic and economic competitive nature of the post-Cold War international environment, globalisation and fragmentation. It is also a study of state endeavours for the survival of these two states. The investigation was founded on the view that traditional state explanations of international relations do not satisfactorily account for the complexity of how state-society interactions in these two countries influence their internal and external efforts towards their state survival. The thesis is also innovative in that there have been almost no studies that have researched the two countries, side by side. Section One of the thesis provides a theoretical framework and explanatory tools &#8211; a theoretical framework in international relations through examining globalisation and fragmentation. In exploring the bases for the survival of the state, this thesis investigates the link between domestic political conditions and foreign policy responses by employing the explanatory tools of the state-in-society analysis and foreign policy behaviour analysis. By so doing, the studies presented in this thesis enable the capture of the dynamics of intensified state-society interactions in two different states, and show how these influence the survival of the state. In particular, it considers the difference between a weak state and a strong state. A weak state is limited in its state strength in terms of compliance, government legitimacy and participation and ability to create social cohesion. On the other hand, a state that can maximise its state strength is a strong state. It is argued that both kinds of states have different abilities when responding and adapting to the challenges of globalisation. Section Two explores domestic and foreign policy in PNG. The first study is a critical examination of the interaction between the state and society in a weak state &#8211; PNG. It is argued that a state that is being challenged by domestic social forces is weakened, but also that a weak state is not necessarily synonymous with a weak society. The second part of Section Two offers a critical and comprehensive examination of the foreign policy responses of PNG and how it has responded to its external challenges. It is shown to be a country with limited available state resources and foreign policy options. Therefore, it is also argued that PNG's foreign policy behaviour must be considered from the point of view of the ongoing need for the survival of the state, that is, &#8216;friends to all, enemies to none&#8217;.Section Three is a critical examination of how particular social forces penetrate the policy-making of a state in domestic politics and in the foreign policy arena in Japan. It is argued that Japan's hierarchical structure is a fundamental cause for the intensified state-society interaction, and results in certain social forces penetrating the policy-making of the state by gaining proximity to the highest authorities of the state. In domestic politics, it is argued that the penetration of policy-making by certain social forces weakened state capacity, and ultimately resulted in the annihilation of non-conservative politics that led Japan's political transformation in the 1990s. In the foreign policy arena, it is argued that the penetration of policy-making by particular social forces occurred because Japan's Official Development Assistance provides relative material power that the state leaders and elite can mobilise as a powerful diplomatic tool, minimising its foreign policy vulnerability, while maximising its strategic foreign policy objectives. It is therefore argued that Japan&#8217;s state-society interactions determine its external responses. This thesis has shown how state-society interaction in PNG and Japan has influenced various responses for their survival. The studies throughout the thesis show that while the state that is a strong state has greater capacity than a state that is a weak state, a society in a weak state possesses greater resilience and tenaciousness than its counterpart society in a strong state.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and synthesis of novel anti-malarial agents</field><field name="creator">Yepuri, Nageshwar Rao</field><field name="description">A new convergent methodology has been developed for the synthesis of the anti-malarial lead compound ADAM (24). A series of 41 derivatives were successfully synthesized, 35 of which were new compounds; all of which related to ADAM (24).

A preliminary structure activity relationship analysis study was performed, which suggested that while 4,6-diaminopyrimidine analogs are inactive, if one of the two amines are alkylated then anti-malarial activity is returned. In order to generate a more thorough analysis, more compounds need to be synthesized by modifying the side chain. The SAR study also suggests that the heteroatom nitrogens in the pyrimidine ring are required for anti-malarial activity. The entire range of derivatives based on 5-benzoyl-4,6-dichloropyrimidine are inactive. The replacement of the phenyl substituent with an isopropyl group resulted in good anti-malarial activity but less than the parent compound. Novel synthetic dimerising methodology mediated by thallium(III) trifluoroacetate has been developed for the synthesis of biindoles. The methodology included the development of 2,2- and 2,7-biindoles, and 2,7,7,7-triindole. A series of 41 new indole derivatives were synthesized and screened for anti-malarial activity, of which three showed significant anti-malarial activity. During this study, the dimerisation of indole mediated by triflic anhydride was demonstrated for the first time. There are two other interesting synthetic results were observed, the triflic anhydride-mediated bi-pyrroloindole formation and the formation of the 1,2-dihydropyridineindole. Most compounds synthesized here were further tested in a series of additional biological assays, and a number of them showed activity against HIV reverse transcriptase, integrase, tuberculosis, anti-fungal and anti-cancer. In particular, the biaryl derivatives showed moderate activity against tuberculosis and fungal, which may be able to investigate further. A couple of biaryl compounds also showed significant anti-cancer activity. [Note: this abstract contained scientific formulae that would not come across on this form.

Research in RE seeks to understand how such descriptions might be generated, what the appropriate languages are for representing such descriptions, how changes to such descriptions might be managed and support might be provided for ensuring that such descriptions satisfy several normative quality criteria. A key pre-requisite for automated, or semi-automated, tool support for RE process is the ability to make these descriptions machine-processible. This is especially important in the context of devising tool support for the difficult process of requirements inconsistency handling. The key thesis presented in this document is that the notion of semantic markup (as devised in the Semantic Web initiative), when applied to requirements specifications in semi-formal or informal notations, can form the basis for automated, or semi-automated, tool support for inconsistency handling. In support of this thesis, we present several examples of extracting machine-processible descriptions of semi-formal and informal requirements specifications. We present some general methodological guidelines for how this might be achieved and present the outlines of a new generation of end-user markup tools, which, embedded in CASE environments, might ease the process of annotating specifications with such markup. We then present the design and implementation of a system that detects (and in part, helps resolve) inconsistencies in such specifications. We believe that this can form the basis for a new research program in requirements engineering exploring the deployment of semantic markup techniques in specifications. An initial version of our work has been reported in [Chen et al., 2003}.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of a novel ars gene cluster in sinorhizobium sp.</field><field name="creator">Su, Chenwei</field><field name="description">Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic metalloid that has been widely used in agriculture, industry and medicine throughout the world. As it occurs quite commonly throughout the environment, many living organisms have established a tolerance or resistance to its biologically toxic effects. The most common form of resistance in bacteria is centred on the efflux mechanism that is controlled by the arsenic resistance (ars) genes. Diversely arranged ars genes have been widely found on both chromosomes and plasmids of various bacteria. A Sinorhizobium strain (As4) isolated from the soil of arsenic-contaminated cattle dip-sites in Northern NSW, Australia, is able to actively grow in the presence of high concentrations of arsenic. Further examination led to the identification of a novel ars gene cluster (As4 ars gene cluster) that contains six or more genes, including a trxB gene that co-functions with the arsC gene. The first five genes are organised in a unique order &#65533; arsRBCDA when compared to the common order of arsRDABC found in other ars operons such as pR773. Computer analysis predicted that more than one transcription unit might exist in this gene cluster with arsRBC and the downstream genes (arsDAtrxB) transcribed separately. A previously conducted Northern blot analysis seemed to support this view, but no definitive conclusion could be reached without further experiments. This thesis describes the design, construction and use of a series of reporter gene plasmids, in which the promoter P(subscript arsR) and arsR gene or/and putative promoter P(subscript arsD) and arsD gene were fused upstream to the promoterless lacZ gene of plasmid pUJ8. Activity of the different constructs was monitored by a ?-galactosidase assay. The results indicated that the putative promoter P(subscript arsD) may not exist, and that the expression of the ars genes were regulated by ArsR and ArsD, which can be induced by arsenite. The transcript identification by RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that the mRNA transcription could read through the predicted putative transcriptional terminator between arsC and arsD, indicating that the As4 ars gene cluster was transcribed under the control of a single promoter, which is in line with the results from the reporter gene analysis. Bioinformatic analysis of the ArsR, ArsD and ArsA proteins of the As4 ars gene cluster was undertaken to examine specific consensus sequences. Alignment of the As4 ArsD with seven other ArsDs shows that the As4 ArsD protein lacks a particular pair of cysteine residues, which have been demonstrated to be required for induction in pR773 ArsD, suggesting the regulatory mechanism of As4 ArsD may be different from that of pR773. Bioinformatic analysis of the non-coding region in front of arsD in the As4 ars gene cluster revealed some specific sequences, including two inverted repeats, and that a putative regulatory protein-binding site exists within this region. Therefore, some suggestions as to the function of the region and the regulatory mechanism of the As4 ars gene cluster are made. It is possible that the cluster can be transcribed to both a short mRNA (arsRBC) and a long mRNA (arsRBCDAtrxB) depending on the concentrations of inducers, with ArsD binding to the putative regulatory elements in front of arsD to interfere with the transcription of the downstream genes. Alternatively, it may be that the inverted repeats in front of arsD can form a stem-loop to regulate the downstream genes at a post-transcriptional level. The phylogenetic analysis and comparison of As4 Ars proteins with their counterparts encoded by other ars operons also indicated that unlike the arsRDABC operons which exist on the plasmids of Gram-negative bacteria, the As4 ars operon possibly originated from an arsRBC operon of a Gram-positive organism by acquisition of an arsDA operon at the end of arsC.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A genetic algorithm for multiple resource-constrained project scheduling</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Qiang</field><field name="description">The aim of this paper is to present a new genetic algorithm approach for large scale multiple resource-constrained project-scheduling problems. This research area is very common in industry especially when a set of activities needs to be finished as soon as possible subject to two sets of constraints, (?) Precedence constraints, and (?) Resource constraints. The literature reveals that previous researches have developed numerous scheduling methods and techniques to overcome the complex nature of this problem. However, there are still no promising methods that guarantee optimal solutions as well as computational feasibility. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are very promising Artificial Intelligence approaches to this problem in terms of the computational feasibility and the quality of solutions. However, the most common models of GA are very difficult to implement in scheduling problems. On the other hand, using specific and proper design of GA can make scheduling problems tractable. The emphasis in this research is on investigating the complexity of scheduling problems and developing a new GA approach to solve this problem in such ways that the advantages of GA are fully utilized and the design of GA is based on the nature of scheduling problems. In order to make this research more practical and challenging, we extend the type of resources constraints to multiple types rather than only one resource type.

The model applies to aggregate network traffic generated by a population of users accessing the Web on the Internet. The new model is relatively simple and allows for both the accurate estimation of peak HTTP request rate and the development of two new rules of thumb concerning HTTP request rate. Previous models of HTTP request rate have generally been single user models of a form that are both complex to transform into a model of aggregate traffic and apply to the estimation of peak aggregate HTTP request rate. One comparable model of aggregate HTTP traffic models HTTP request inter-arrival time rather than HTTP request rate and is shown to over estimate peak HTTP request rate. There are few existing rules of thumb concerning HTTP request rate. The two rules proposed here are the first for the estimation of either standard deviation or peak HTTP request rate at the second time scale. The new model for the marginal distribution of aggregate per second HTTP request rate is based on the P&#65533;lya-Aeppli probability distribution. The selection of the P&#65533;lya-Aeppli distribution can be justified from observed distributions of HTTP request rate of individual Web users and the number of active users per second in a population of Web users. The results are based on the analysis of five independent traces of Web traffic. One trace, collected by the candidate, is of per-user Web traffic generated in a postgraduate research laboratory at the University of Wollongong (UOW) between 1994 and 1997. The other four traces are large independent traces of aggregate Web traffic collected between 1996 and 2002.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthropods and fire: studies in a southeast Australian heathland</field><field name="creator">Tap, Patrick M</field><field name="description">The studies described in this thesis were aimed at unravelling the relationships between fire and arthropods. This has been investigated in a number ofstudies in the literature. Some studies reported finding fewer arthropods in burned than in unburned sites, others reported finding more, and still others found no difference. Factors that may help to explain this variety of outcomes include differences in arthropod taxa and habitat type, time since fire, and methods and duration of sampling. I analysed the frequencies of studies reporting fewer, equivalent or more arthropods in collections from burned compared to unburned sites for eight categories (i.e. taxon, taxonomic group, trophic level, habitat type, season of fire, censusing method, time since fire and duration of sampling) and found some support for the hypothesis that differences between burned and unburned sites are taxon-dependent. However, few of the studies examined had an experimental design of sufficient power to allow a critical analysis of responses to fire. Most studies were short-term (i.e. &lt; I year) and lacked knowledge of pre-disturbance conditions. Few studies had sufficient replication or adequate controls. Furthermore, few studies investigated the mechanisms underlying described changes.I sought to overcome these methodological problems VIa studies of arthropod communities in heathland located within Barren Grounds Nature Reserve, near Kiama, NSW. The studies comprised: (i) an initial comparison of a site burned by a wildfire in January 1983 and an unburned site, with one set of prefire and 34 sets of postfue samples collected between October 1982 and March 1985, analysed to assess differences between sites; (ii) subsequent reburning of half of one of these sites in March 1985, with a further 13 sets of postfire samples collected between the time of the experimental bum and January 1987, analysed to assess differences between sites; and (iii) a replicated manipulative experiment (i.e. particular combinations of burning, slashing, mowing and vacuuming) initiated in December 1985, with four sets of post-treatment samples collected between January 1986 and January 1987 analysed to assess treatment effects. In all three studies, arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps (larvae not examined) and data for major groups analysed using Analysis of Variance.In the first field study, 21 taxa were identified among 15,883 macroarthropods collected from the burned and unburned sites. The majority of individuals comprised Formicidae (72%), Araneae (8%), Diptera (7%), Orthoptera (3%), Coleoptera (4%) and Opiliones (1%). In addition to the macroarthropods, Collembola (12,752) and Acarina (8,233), referred to as microarthropods, were counted for eight dates. Comparisons of the mean numbers of individuals trapped at each sample date revealed the following postfire differences between ii burned and unburned sites: (a) Overall, significantly more Acarina, 'total macroarthropods', Formicidae, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, but fewer Collembola and Diptera, and equivalent numbers of Araneae were trapped in the burned than in the unburned site; (b) For all groups except Araneae, there was a significant interaction between site and sample date with each macroarthropod group showing a consistent pattern of peaks in numbers of captures in warm periods of the year and troughs during cool periods; (c) The taxa also differed in the timing of the differences between sites with captures of Formicidae, Araneae, Coleoptera and Acarina peaking soon after burning (within 5 to 48 days); and Collembola, Diptera and Orthoptera peaking much later after burning (around 190, 380 and 700 days, respectively).  For all major macroarthropod groups except Araneae, differences in captures between sites were still apparent at 2 years after burning. Interpretation of the role of fire in producing differences reported in the first study was limited by two main constraints: (i) paucity of prefire data for each site, and (ii) lack of replication of treatments. The first of these two problems was addressed in the second field study when half of the 'unburned site' from the first study was experimentally burned. Data obtained from trap grids in the burned and unburned halves were compared to the data collected in the site during the 29 months prior to treatment. Most taxa present before burning, were present after burning. Overall, after the experimental fire, 16 taxa were identified among 2816 macroarthropods trapped from burned and unburned halves. The majority of macroarthropods comprised Fonnicidae (68%), Araneae (13%), Diptera (8%), Opiliones (3%), Orthoptera (3%) and Coleoptera (2%). Comparisons of the mean numbers of individuals of the major taxa trapped at each sample date revealed the following patterns: (a) Overall, as in the first study, significantly more 'total macroarthropods', Formicidae, Orthoptera and Coleoptera were trapped in the burned than in the unburned half of the study site, numbers of Araneae trapped in each half of the site were not different, but unlike the first study, the same was also true for Diptera; (b) Prior to burning there were no groups for which significant differences between half-sites were detected; (c) For all groups except Araneae and Coleoptera, there was a significant interaction between half-site and sample date for the period following the experimental fire; (d) The taxa differed in the timing of the differences between half-sites. For example, captures of Araneae, Diptera and Formicidae peaked soon after burning (i.e. within 1 to 5 days) while Orthoptera peaked much later (481 to 644 days). For all major macroarthropod groups, differences in captures between sites were still apparent at 1.8 years after burning.The second constraint of the wildfrre study (i.e. lack of replication of treatments) was addressed in a manipulative experiment that evaluated the role of vegetative cover in the postfire response. The following eight treatments were established in a study area comprised iii of 64, 5 x 5m plots (i.e. 8 replicates per treatment). The treatments were: (i) Control; (ii) Burned only; (iii) Burned then vacuumed; (iv) Burned, vacuumed then covered with slashed vegetation; (v) Scorched (approximately one-third of plot area burned); (vi) Slashed then most cuttings removed; (vii) Slashed. mown, then all cuttings removed; and (viii) Slashed then all cuttings left. The data analysed were from collections undertaken at 16, 77,242 and 403 days after initiation of the treatments. Overall, 18 taxa were identified among 60,952 macroarthropods trapped. The majority comprised Formicidae (90%), Araneae (4%) and Diptera. (2%). The additional examination of the effects of burning, by comparing Burned only and Control plots, confirmed the general patterns observed in the first two studies.Comparisons of the data from each of the eight treatments revealed the following general patterns: (a) Significant differences among the eight treatments were found for all the taxa tested excepting Hemiptera; (b) Differences were significant at all four dates for 'total macroarthropods', Orthoptera and Formicidae; at three dates for Diptera and Hymenoptera (other than Formicidae); and at two dates for Araneae, Thysanoptera and Coleoptera; (c) For some groups, most individuals were trapped in treatments where vegetative cover was removed (ie. by burning or slashing), and least in treatments where cover was partially removed or added after burning; this pattern was apparent at all four dates for 'total macroartbropods', Orthoptera and Formicidae; and at two dates for Thysanoptera; the reverse was true, at one date, for Coleoptera; no particular pattern was apparent for Araneae, or Diptera; (d) Comparisons within modes of disturbance (e.g.' burned vs. other burned', 'slashed vs. other slashed') showed that differences between plots occurred most often where levels of surface cover were very different (e.g. Burned only vs. Burned, vacuumed then covered with slash); (e) Comparisons between modes of disturbance generally showed that there were few differences for partial removal of cover, but for substantial or complete removal ofvegetation cover, they differed in only half the comparisons.The studies outlined in this thesis confirm various patterns that have been reported in the literature on the relationships between fire and arthropods. That is: (i) there is not an elimination of arthropods; (ii) many taxa are trapped more readily after fire; (iii) for some taxa this increase occurs soon after burning (eg, Araneae and Fonnicidae); and (iv) for other taxa, the increase occurs some time later (eg, Orthoptera, Diptera). Patterns and directions of differences between burned and unburned areas were also found to vary between taxa, thereby adding additional weight to the hypothesis that fire responses are taxon-dependent. Details of the mechanisms behind observed differences are more difficult to resolve. The randomised block burning-and-slashing study suggested that, for Formicidae and Orthoptera, the presence or absence of vegetative cover, as much as burning per se, is an important variable that influences the postfire environment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Help-negation for suicidal thoughts in sub-clinical samples of young people</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Coralie Joy</field><field name="description">Across the popular and academic literature, it is widely recognised that young people with persistent suicidal thoughts are at high risk for suicide completion. It is also accepted that seeking and receiving appropriate help offers protection against the development of acute forms of suicidality, along with suicide completion. Yet, as promising as appropriate help-seeking appears for suicide prevention, a growing number of studies suggest that suicidal ideation itself may impede the help-seeking process. There is evidence that acutely suicidal samples will negate or avoid available help, and there are indications that the help-negation process may occur in samples before levels of suicidal ideation become acute and require clinical intervention. With implications for suicide prevention and clinical practice, findings of help-negation suggest that if the effect can be found in sub-clinical (i.e., non-acutely suicidal) samples, help-negation can be identified as a risk-factor for youth suicide. Moreover, if factors contributing to the help-negation effect can be identified, it may be possible to prevent the help-negation process from occurring. This thesis explores the help-negation effect in four studies with young people at sub-clinical levels of suicidal ideation. Two studies were conducted with university students and two studies, with high school students. The help-negation effect is indicated by negative associations between suicidal ideation and intentions to seek help for suicidal thoughts from a variety of specific sources, along with a positive association between suicidal ideation and intentions to seek help from no-one. Study 1 used a sample of 302 first-year university students, Study 2, a sample of 269 private high school students, Study 3, a second sample of 351 first-year university students, and Study 4, a sample of 105 public high school students. Studies 1 to 3 found that higher levels of suicidal ideation related significantly to lower intentions to seek help for suicidal thoughts from a range of sources, and higher intentions to seek help from no-one. Study 4 found that higher levels of suicidal ideation related significantly to lower intentions to seek help from family for suicidal thoughts. Suicidal ideation was measured by the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ; Reynolds, 1988) and help seeking intentions, by the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ; Deane, Wilson, &amp; Ciarrochi, 2001; Wilson, Deane, Ciarrochi, &amp; Rickwood, 2003). In addition to the help-negation hypothesis, this thesis examines the impact of several variables on the help-negation effect. Studies 1 and 2 examine the possibility that hopelessness and/or prior help-seeking experience might either explain or strengthen the help-negation relationship in university and/or high school students. Hopelessness is measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS; Beck, Rial, &amp; Rickles, 1974) and prior help-seeking experience, by the GHSQ. Similar results in both Studies 1 and 2 found that neither hopelessness nor prior help-seeking could fully explain the help-negation relationship over and above the impact of suicidal ideation. In Study 1, there was no evidence to indicate that hopelessness or prior help-seeking moderated the help-negation relationship in university students. However, Study 2 found that hopelessness might contribute to the overall strength of help-negation effect in high school students. In Study 2, although hopelessness was unable to fully account for the help-negation effect, a small moderation effect was found, indicating that higher levels of hopelessness were associated with a greater reluctance to seek help for suicidal thoughts as levels of suicidal ideation increased. On the basis of Study 1 and 2 results, it was hypothesised that hopelessness might contribute to the strength of the help-negation effect, at least in adolescent populations, through negative appraisals about help as a suitable and effective way to manage suicidal thoughts. It was also hypothesised that some young people may not seek help for suicidal thoughts because they do not recognise they have a problem or they view suicidal thoughts as not in need of solution. Studies 3 and 4 explore the possibility that problem-solving appraisal and/or problem recognition might either explain or strengthen the help-negation effect, as for Studies 1 and 2, in samples of university and high school students. Aspects of problem-solving are measured by the short form of Frauenknecht and Blacks (1995) Social Problem-Solving Inventory for Adolescents (SPSI-A). Similar results for Studies 3 and 4 indicated that neither problem-solving appraisal nor problem recognition could fully account for the help-negation effect over and above the impact of suicidal ideation, and neither variable moderated the help-negation relationship. However, additional results in Study 4 found that total problem-solving capacity might explain adolescents help-negation from family. In study 4, the negative relationship between students levels of suicidal ideation and their help-seeking intentions for family became non-significant once total problem-solving capacity was controlled. Together, the results of Studies 1 to 4 confirm the robust nature of the help-negation process in sub-clinical youth samples and suggest that help-negation is not merely the result of hopelessness, prior help-seeking experiences, or aspects of poor social problem-solving, but a function of other variables that are associated with suicidal ideation and help-seeking intentions. Results are discussed in terms of individuation and autonomy, help-seeking fears, coping style, and personality characteristics. The thesis concludes by highlighting a number of questions for subsequent research. It is proposed that answers to these questions may provide explanations for the help-negation effect together with specific strategies for prevention and points for more effective early intervention and clinical practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data analysis and anode materials for lithium ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Matthew John</field><field name="description">In order to improve the capacity of lithium ion batteries higher capacity anode materials are required to replace the existing carbonaceous materials. The higher capacity materials must however also have a good cycle life. Many materials have been investigated to try and find a material offering such a desirable combination of properties. A number of materials are investigated as possible anode materials for lithium ion batteries including intermetallics with compositions based on FeAl3, Al47Fe15Si38, Al20Fe5Si2, Al9FeSi3, FeSi and FeSi2 along with other materials such as Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, Bi2Sr2Ca0.3Y0.7Cu2O8, and nanometre SiC. The intermetallic materials for the investigation were prepared through the arc melting of the constituent elements together followed by ball milling. The Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 and Bi2Sr2Ca0.3Y0.7Cu2O8 materials were also ball milled but were initially prepared through the spray drying of nitrate solutions with subsequent sintering operations. The SiC materials were obtained through commercial suppliers. Although many of the materials offered a high initial discharge capacity the capacity was not maintained over the following cycles. All the materials did however demonstrate the dramatic influence that the microstructure can have on the electrochemical properties of the material. Given the variability of the electrochemical performance with the alteration of the microstructure, improvement of the cycle life through exploration of microstructural variation may be possible. Although a range of intermetallic compositions were examined and there were differences in the experimental methods used to examine them the results do suggest that for intermetallic materials compositions with under 60 weight percent of active material and a specific surface area less than 180 m2/g should be examined.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of water-droplet impact on hot galvanised steel surfaces</field><field name="creator">Bierbrauer, Frank</field><field name="description">Hot-dip galvanising is commonly used in industry to increase the corrosion resistance of cold-rolled steel products for commercial use such as roofing and walling of buildings.  Traditionally, the zinc coated steel surface is characterised by a relatively smooth surface with large spangle relief which is detrimental to corrosion resistance. One of the techniques to modify the surface appearance consists of a water-mist spray solution which allows for the creation of a large number of nucleation sites giving rise to micro rather than macro spangles, thereby producing a much smoother surface. In addition, controlling the spray parameters allows the hot, zinc coated, steel surface to be &#8216;roughened&#8217; facilitating its bonding to concrete or for lamination. The proper control of water droplet impact parameters such as impact velocity, droplet diameter and crater size is essential for a successful implementation of this technique. Certain aspects of the second of these processes, the production of rough, non-skid galvanised steel sheet surfaces, has been addressed by this thesis.Although an experimental investigation of the effect of such water droplet parameters on the formation of zinc surface characteristics such as crater diameter and depth would provide a great deal of valuable data it is fraught with difficulties. The presence of hot metal surfaces exceeding 450oC and the boiling and evaporation of water droplets taking place at very small timescales (microseconds) all combine to make an experimental study difficult to implement not to say unsafe. On the other hand computer simulations with a properly constructed mathematical model are a valuable tool for the investigation of these parameters.A comprehensive modelling of the process would include the process of heat transfer: such as conduction through a vapour layer, internal droplet and vapour convection, radiation from the hot surface, solidification of the zinc liquid layer; as well as the fluid dynamical aspects: such as surface tension at the droplet-air, droplet-zinc and zinc-air interfaces, the droplet impact phenomena such as spreading and splashing and the formation of impact craters and wave propagation in a thin viscous zinc layer. As a first stage in the modelling exercise this thesis will concentrate on an investigation of single water droplet impact on a thin liquid zinc layer with a steel substrate which provides a simplified and computationally tractable model of the spraying process.The objectives of this thesis are twofold: firstly, the development and construction of an accurate, robust mathematical model and, secondly, the solution of the model for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid layer of zinc on a steel substrate. This model must be able to deal with rapidly deforming moving interfaces and maintain stability in the presence of very large density and viscosity ratios. This moving boundary problem requires the tracking of three fluid interfaces while also maintaining incompressibility. The Godunov-Marker-Particle Projection Scheme developed in this thesis is able to satisfy these requirements. Through a combination of approximate projection methods, Godunov convective differencing, Marker-Particle interface tracking and velocity filters the method is able to treat viscous, multi-fluid free surface flows. The modelling of free surface flows with more than two separate immiscible fluids, to the author&#8217;s knowledge not yet published in the literature, is a secondary aim of the thesis. A major part of the thesis deals with the thorough testing of each aspect of the combination of numerical methods used: firstly, the Poisson solver with discontinuous coefficients and homogeneous boundary conditions used in the approximate projection method, analytical solutions for the construction of an initial solenoidal velocity field, testing of the projection and velocity filters and kinematic tests of the Marker-Particle method for tracking of fluid interfaces; secondly, dynamical tests of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for: an exact solution, the Lid-Driven Cavity and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The combined method is also successfully tested on the limited two-fluid droplet-solid and droplet-liquid impact problems before solving the thesis problem.It is shown that, for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid zinc layer, impact crater growth, diameter and depth, are linearly dependent on impact velocity. For a given impact velocity, crater diameter is not effected by increasing zinc layer depth although crater depth is linearly dependent. The time at which the droplet commences penetration of the zinc layer is inversely dependent on impact velocity and the maximum crater diameter and depth are nonlinearly dependent on impact velocity. The model shows that, within the convective timescale, droplet impact on thin liquid zinc layers can be approximately described by droplet spreading on a solid zinc surface. The droplet is shown to spread preferentially to the zinc layer splashing after completion of spreading. This shows that adjustment of the droplet impact velocity or zinc layer depth can vary the surface roughness appropriately.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agent-based peer-to-peer grid computing architecture</field><field name="creator">Tang, Jia</field><field name="description">Grid computing as an emerging technology has made great achievements in scientific computation. Leveraged by other technologies, such as cluster computing and web services, Grid computing for the first time seamlessly integrated large numbers of interconnected computers and provided Internet-scale computing resource sharing, selection, and aggregation. The sheer numbers of desktop systems today make the potential advantages of interoperability between desktops and servers into a single Grid system quite compelling. However, these commodity systems exhibit significantly di_erent properties than conventional server-based Grid systems. They are usually highly autonomous and heterogeneous systems, and their availability varies from time to time. We call such an environment an open environment. This thesis aims at bridging the gap between conventional Grid computing and its potential application in open environments by proposing an agent-based peer-to-peer Grid computing architecture, whilst also providing reasonable compatibility and interoperability with conventional Grid systems and clients. We introduce developments in Grid computing and highlight the targeted research questions concerning Grid computing in open environments. Using these questions as a basis, we review the architecture of the conventional computing Grid and related standards. We indicate that the conventional Grid has five problems, which are barriers to the deployment and application of the Grid in an open environment. Aiming at solving these problems, we propose a hybrid solution, which is a combined solution that employs both client/server computing architecture and peer-to-peer computing architecture. This solution abandons conventional super-local Grid architecture, and is more e_cient, flexible and robust in open environments. We also introduce a multi-purpose task model to handle state persistence and provide help v for task decomposition. Furthermore, we employ multi-agent technology to construct the underlying components of our Grid architecture, which brings flexibility and robustness. Based on the hybrid solution, we develop the architecture to a pure peer-to-peer architecture. In the new solution, we make improvements to the task model so that it provides additional support to task decomposition and inter-task communication in a transparent manner. We develop two frameworks for message passing and routing, and for resource management respectively. These frameworks, together with various intelligent and evolving mechanisms, promote the new adaptability and performance to a higher level. We widely adopt Web Services and other Grid standards in both solutions to maintain compatibility and interoperability with existing Grid systems and clients. Finally, we discuss the remaining problems with Grid computing in open environments, and outline potential research directions. In summary, we show that Grid computing architecture, integrating peer-to-peer computing and multi-agent technologies, presents good scalability, e_ciency, flexibility, and robustness for Grid computing in open environments in comparison with conventional Grid computing architecture.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Content distribution networks over shared infrastructure : a paradigm for future content network deployment</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thanh Vinh</field><field name="description">In this thesis we propose and explore the Overlay Distribution Network (ODN) concept as an alternative, more cost effective and more flexible deployment approach for Content Distribution Networks (CDN). Currently CDNs are established by deploying a dedicated server infrastructure spanning the Internet, which is prohibitively expensive. With ODN, we propose to lease transport and server resources from server and network providers to establish an overlay network of virtual servers and connecting virtual links, which is then used to deliver content in a similar manner to traditional CDNs. Such deployment strategy is expected to be less costly and could allow content network topologies and capacities to be adjusted on-the-fly according to demand. The aim of this thesis is to address the research issues that arise as a result of this new deployment approach. One of the major issues considered is ODN provisioning, which involves topology planning, resource dimensioning and content replica placement. ODN provisioning is significantly different from and more complex than its traditional CDN counterpart due to the nature of the shared infrastructure environment. ODN provisioning would not only have a different optimization objective but also require topology planning, resource dimensioning and content replica placement problems, which are currently addressed independently, to be addressed jointly. To address this ODN provisioning challenge, we develop a provisioning framework that could be used to formulate ODN provisioning models that meet these new requirements. ODN provisioning models for a number of key content distribution applications, including web content distribution, pay-per-view content distribution and live streaming multimedia distribution, are then developed and studied. The models are formulated as mixed integer linear programming optimizations that aim to determine the optimal ODN topology, capacity and content replication pattern, which deliver satisfactory service performance at the minimum cost or maximum profit. As the above ODN provisioning models belong to the NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial) class of problems, they have extremely high complexity and cannot be solved efficiently for realistically large networks. To tackle this difficulty we develop heuristics that aim to find near optimal solutions with less computation effort. Experimental results show that our proposed heuristics are efficient and able find solutions reasonably close to the optimal (within 36% for the web ODN provisioning problem and 20% for the pay-per-view and live streaming multimedia ODN provisioning problems). Our study also demonstrates that provisioning could become significantly inefficient if the heuristics were not designed properly. For example in the web content ODN provisioning problem, a greedy heuristic adapted from existing CDN replica placement heuristics could produce ODN topologies up to 2.5 times more costly compared to a Lagrangian heuristic designed based the problem formulation structure. As part of the ODN provisioning study, we also explore the use of content clustering within the ODN provisioning process. By grouping similar content items together into clusters, which are then considered as a single item during provisioning, content clustering would help reduce provisioning complexity and allow the provisioning models to handle problems with significantly larger number of content items. We show that clustering methods previously developed for CDNs do not work well in the ODN environment. Thus we propose a new hierarchical clustering scheme, where content items are clustered based on first delivery resource requirements and then spatial demand distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this clustering scheme has significant performance improvements over the existing ones. In this thesis we also look into the future and study the ability of the ODN to support applications that require QoS network paths among servers. To enable better support for such applications, we propose to enhance the ODN architecture with switching capabilities that allow ODN owners to control the flow of traffic within their ODN backbone. We examine and demonstrate the benefits of such capabilities using both quantitative and qualitative studies and then develop a shared switch architecture that could be used to provide such support in a shared infrastructure environment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Campus portals : a framework for development accommodating end-users' online activities</field><field name="creator">Fuangvut, Tharitpong</field><field name="description">A Campus Portal is an exciting recent phenomenon forming part of the new generation of online services for all stakeholders in institutions of higher education. Conceptually the general notion of a Portal should be to be distinguished from that of other Webbased applications and the traditional Intranet of the institution. The literature review in Phase One of this research indicates that the major distinguishing characteristics of a Campus Portal are: (i) personalisation, by which end-users are only able to access information and online services pertinent to their activities, and (ii) customisation, by which end-users are able to select their preferred information channels and optional online services. The major objective of this research is to propose a development methodology specifically suitable for Campus Portal projects. While there are many accepted development methodologies for traditional and Web-based Information Systems, no clear body of knowledge on the development of Campus Portals has yet been recognised. Additionally, as this is a new area, the definitions, terms, concepts and important issues agreed to by academic researchers and practitioners, are still evolving. This research, therefore, needs to clarify and identify some important issues regarding Campus Portals and their development, prior to composing the development methodology. In the second and third phases of the research, two studies were carried out, a preliminary study and a case study. These generated more understanding of the issues and extended the body of knowledge on Campus Portals, especially concerning their development. The preliminary study explored and investigated the online services and Campus Portals of 40 higher education institutions&#65533; sites in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK and Canada. The findings of the preliminary study show that there are no standard patterns in the function of personalisation and customisation in Campus Portals. A set of research questions were then put forward to drive further investigation into design and implementation issues regarding the personalisation and customisation functions of Campus Portals. The case study was conducted in an Australian university among the major stakeholder groups, namely, the development team and the end-users (students and academic staff). For the study of the development team, interviews were used to gather information on their current practices and their vision for the future direction of the Campus Portal. Students were the primary focus of the end-user study, from whom data was collected using a survey to build up usage patterns of their online activities. In addition, a group of academic staff were interviewed to obtain data from their perspective to identify and clarify some important issues. The results and findings in this phase of the research contribution to the body of knowledge on Campus Portals and their development. In the final phase of the research, the review of existing development methodologies was continued filtering them through a set of identified criteria based on the findings of the two studies. Finally, the most appropriate development methodology was selected and modified in order to support the requirements identified in this research as critical for the development of a Campus Portal. The result was proposed as a Campus Portal Development Methodology (CPDM) fulfilling the main objective of the research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of oxide scale deformation and surface roughness transformation in hot strip rolling</field><field name="creator">Tang, Jianning</field><field name="description">A layer of oxide scale is inevitably formed on the strip surface due to the high temperature of the hot strip rolling process. Experimental result indicates that the oxide scale surface is rough no matter what the original state of the steel surface is. The oxide scale layer and its surface roughness play an important role in the hot strip rolling process. They may affect the friction and heat transfer and consequently affect the rolling force, torque and energy consumption of the rolling process. Surface roughness is also an important index of rolled strip quality.Hot rolling process and many involved factors have been studied by many researchers. Many models were developed to describe hot strip rolling process and various phenomena in the process. But a model that actually describes the geometrical profile of the rough surface has not been reported. A model that includes oxide scale layer and its surface roughness can better describe the rolling process so that the transformation of the surface roughness can be better understood. The goal of this research is to establish such a model and obtain the required information of the surface roughness transformation and scale layer deformation.In this thesis, a mathematical model is presented to describe the profile of the surface asperity. The algorithms to generate 3D rough surface or 2D rough surface section through the model are also presented. The model can generate random surface roughness and yet the profiles generated are still relatively simple for the convenience of further FEM analysis. The comparison of generated and scanned surface profiles shows that the model can generate a rough surface that fits very well the actual rough surface of the oxide scale of the strip.A circular roll model and a flat roll model, which include the oxide scale layer and profiles of the rough surface, have been developed to simulate the hot strip rolling process. With these models, deformation of the oxide scale layer and the transformation of the surface roughness in the rolling process can be calculated. Other important rolling parameters such as pressure distribution and real area of contact ratio can also be obtained through such models. Comparing the parameters obtained through simulation with those from the experiments, the models developed are effective in calculating these parameters. A developed thermo-mechanical coupling FEM analysis has also been implemented with such models.Many factors may affect the deformation of oxide scale layer and the surface roughness transformation in the hot strip rolling process. The effects of these factors such as &#1048766; Flow stress of oxide scale and steel materials &#1048766; Initial roughness &#1048766; Reduction &#1048766; Work roll surface roughness &#1048766; Scale layer thickness &#1048766; Lubrication &#1048766; Voids inside the scale layer &#1048766; Coefficients of friction on the interfaces of tool-scale and scale-steel &#1048766; Wavelength of the asperityon the scale layer deformation and the surface roughness transformation have been evaluated through the developed models. Simulation results compare closely to the experimental results, which are obtained from the experiments in Gleeble 3000 and experimental rolling mill Hille 100, in scale surface roughness change and other parameters for the hot strip rolling process.The oxide scale layer may crack before or inside the roll bite. The development of the pre-existed openings in the oxide scale layer is simulated. The effect of the ratio of the initial opening width over scale layer thickness, frictional coefficient on the tool-scale and scale-steel interfaces, profile roughness of the interfaces and the lubrication on the propagation of the crack in the rolling process is explored. A model of the crack generation from a weak position in the oxide scale layer has also been developed and the final crack width is in agreement with experimental results.After careful calculation and comparing with the experimental results, a series of conclusions is drawn and further work for the research in this area is recommended.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a spatial technical writing technique: the application of concept mapping and sentence diagramming</field><field name="creator">Ha, Hung Manh</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s era of dynamic information technology, technical documents are becoming bigger and are updated more frequently than ever before. As a result, people have to spend a huge amount of time and efforts to digest these technical documents. At present, traditional technical writing uses word-after-word narrative writing to produce technical documents. The resulting narrative document often has language ambiguity and an inefficient concept manipulation problem which can cause a lot of difficulty for readers. In this thesis, it is proposed that concept mapping and sentence diagramming are two techniques that have the potential to effectively solve the inefficient concept manipulation and the structural language ambiguity problems of natural language narrative. The purpose of this research is therefore to offer a solution to the language ambiguity and inefficient concept manipulation problem existing in the traditional narrative technical documents. Specifically, it seeks to answer the question: is it possible to create a new technical writing technique that has its structure similar to the sentence diagramming technique, but is simpler for readers to understand, and can help readers to efficiently manipulate concepts in a text in a manner similar to that of a concept map? A developmental research method approach was adopted. The research was conducted in two phrases. The first phrase was to develop a new and more effective technical writing technique called &#8216;spatial technical writing&#8217; (STW) based on concept mapping and sentence diagramming techniques. The second phrase was to conduct a small exploratory study using students to compare the STW technique with traditional x narrative. The exploratory study used a small pilot experiment with basic quantitative and qualitative measurements. The quantitative result showed that students achieved a slightly higher mark on comprehension of the narrative text test than the spatial text test. The probability analysis showed that the pilot experiment was not significant. The qualitative result revealed that the main reason that students did not do as well on the spatial text test was because they did not thoroughly understand the STW symbols used in the pilot experiment. Due to the lack of an experimental budget; the pilot experiment couldn&#8217;t test all STW symbols, and the students didn&#8217;t receive enough training to understand STW sufficiently. These two confounding variables distorted the pilot experiment and made the results of pilot experiment inconclusive. However there was enough encouragement to continue the research. The result of this pilot experiment will be used to refine the STW technique, and to plan a full-scale experiment in the future. Finally, the implication of this research is that; if the Internet based STW software is developed, it can help people to digest technical knowledge in ashorter time and with less effort than traditional narrative.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between teacher learning and school culture</field><field name="creator">Bean, Wendy M</field><field name="description">On school culture and teacher learning.'It is a culture with very high expectations from both parents and staff.

The study was set within the qualitative research paradigm and involved focused observation, recording, analysis and checking for reliability through the use of credible measures. The research revealed the complex relationships between professional development, teacher learning and school culture. The findings of this study indicated that the choice of professional development activity, the actual processes and structures within that chosen activity, teacher attributes, that is, attitudes to learning, and the school culture all have a significant impact on the teacher learning that takes place. Further, the grounded theory showed how the school culture could be observed through the lenses of the school community, values and beliefs, processes in place and conditions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerline easements: ecological impacts and effects on small mammal movement</field><field name="creator">Strevens, Tanya C</field><field name="description">Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognised as the two primary threats to biological diversity worldwide. Powerline easements are linear habitat features that occur in all land tenures, including national parks. Where they occur in areas of natural vegetation, the vegetation is periodically mowed to maintain short grassy conditions. This creates a stark discontinuity with the natural vegetation in the area.With the creation of powerline easements comes the simultaneous generation of large tracts of &#8216;edge habitat&#8217; at the boundary between the easement and natural vegetation. In these regions, ecological processes and abiotic conditions can vary considerably from those in the bushland interior, with potentially negative effects on biodiversity. It is important, therefore, to understand the magnitude of the effects of powerline easements. By generating a series of scenarios using GIS, I explored this in a 5,735km2 region of New South Wales that is rich in conservation reserves but highly fragmented by linear anthropogenic features. While the area of habitat replaced by powerline easements was not great (0.57% of all habitat in the study area), the total area of habitat likely to be ecologically affected by these features is very extensive, up to 14,070ha. Powerlines make a substantial contribution to the subdivision of native bushland in this study area.Linear features, such as powerline easements, can inhibit the movement of small mammals. Isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction as a result of environmental stochasticity (e.g. bushfire, disease), and are also liable to loss of genetic diversity. To quantify the barrier effect posed to small mammals by powerline easements, I conducted a mark-recapture study at four sites over a 2-year period. This revealed an extremely low rate of easement crossing by the two common small mammal species, Rattus fuscipes and Antechinus stuartii, even where vegetation in the linear opening had grown tall and dense. There was some evidence to suggest that when animals did cross from one side of the easement to the other, it tended to be when vegetation was denser. There were generally very few captures of animals in the easements themselves, even where numbers were substantial in the adjacent forest. This suggested that competitive exclusion did not explain the infrequent easement crossings. However, one site in which easement vegetation was well-established, individuals were captured relatively regularly in the easement. As a first step in developing a strategy to mitigate the barrier effect observed, I sought a better understanding of the habitat preferences and movement behaviour of my study species. Using the spool-and-line technique, I followed the paths of spooled animals through the habitat and, at intervals, scored the vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the spool trail. I compared these results to availability of these habitat features in the habitat in order to quantify preferences of the two species for particular microhabitats. Rattus fuscipes responded positively to logs and to higher densities of shrub cover. A preference for areas with higher densities of shrub cover was also identified. Antechinus stuartii exhibited a significant association with leaf litter, and preferential use of larger logs and trunks.Based on the knowledge of these habitat preferences, I constructed two habitat corridors in the easement at each of the four study sites. These &#8216;linkages&#8217; were composed of rows of logs and branches that linked the natural vegetation on the two sides of the easement. After initial experimentation with straight linkages, I incorporated kinks to test more effectively whether spooled animals would follow the course of these structures to the shelter of the adjacent habitat or would ignore the favoured habitat characteristics provided in the linkages. Antechinus stuartii used the linkages more than R. fuscipes; they were less inclined to move away from it and into the easement. While some R. fuscipes individuals did use the linkages either partially or entirely, others strayed from them into the open easement. They strayed significantly further when shrub vegetation in the linkage was dense. Rattus fuscipes was less likely to leave the linkages when they were straight than when there were kinks incorporated into them. The level of ground vegetation had little effect on the distance that R. fuscipes moved away from the linkages following release.The path taken by animals released on linkages, as well as in the open easement was described using a measure of &#8216;tortuosity&#8217;; the numbers of angles in each of four size classes per unit distance. It was then possible to compare the nature of the movement paths of animals in the open easement, on the habitat linkages, and in the adjacent habitat. Overall, the greatest number of turns per metre was made in the open easement, with fewest in the forest habitat. For both R. fuscipes and A. stuartii, the trend was for more of the smallest angles in the open than the habitat, and more large angles in the habitat. I found no significant difference between the open easement and the linkage in terms of the proportions of turns in each angle category for either species.Finally, I carried out a series of translocations of R. fuscipes and A. stuartii to test whether easement crossing could be induced in individuals that usually showed no evidence of inclination to travel into the easement. Selection of habitat characteristics and the tortuosity of the movement path were recorded. More than half of the individuals translocated to the opposite side of the easement returned to their side of origin in 1-5 days. Others may have returned after trapping was concluded or were simply not recaptured during the trapping session. Thus, animals can and will cross the powerline easements. Translocated animals exhibited a more tortuous movement path than animals in familiar habitat, which may be related to searching behaviour as the animal investigates its new environment, perhaps selecting a travel path for the return journey to its home range.Powerlines are a little-studied source of habitat fragmentation, despite the widespread nature of their distribution. Given the barrier effect that has been demonstrated in this study and the potential ecological consequences of this and also of edge effects, these habitat features deserve greater attention. While corridors may in some situations mitigate the barrier effect for native animal species, linkages across powerline easements constructed in this study had little impact on the number of easement crossing events. This suggests that our understanding of what characteristics of natural habitats need to be incorporated into corridors to make them more suitable is insufficient. Closer examination of the factors that influence the movement behaviour of small mammals in a variety of habitat situations will provide useful insights into how management actions could be improved.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic annotation of digital photos</field><field name="creator">Shao, Wenbin</field><field name="description">Content-based image retrieval searches for an image by using a set of visual features that characterize the image content. This technique has been used in many areas, such as geographical information processing, space science, biomedical image processing, target recognition in military applications and bioinformatics. Many approaches have been proposed to reduce the gap between the low-level visual features and high-level contents. In this thesis, a multi-class automatic annotation system is developed to bridge the semantic gap. Given an image, the proposed system will automatically generate keywords corresponding to the image contents. The system is evaluated using a large image database consisting of over 16000 images collected from various online repositories.The proposed multi-class annotation system is based on salient features and support vector machines (SVMs). A new feature called gradient direction histogram is proposed for image classification. Instead of relying on a single feature, the SVMs in our system can automatically select the most suitable features from a pool of six MPEG-7 visual descriptors and the proposed gradient direction histogram. Multi-class SVMs are constructed using two-class SVMs in different combinations.We have examined several multi-class support vectormachines including one-versus-all SVMs, pair-wise SVMs and decision directed acyclic graph SVMs. The results confirm that the pair-wise and decision directed acyclic graph SVMs are suitable for multi-class applications. In pair-wise SVMs, we propose a voting scheme named confidence score voting. Our results show that, compared to majority voting, confidence score voting improves the classification accuracy. Combining salient features leads to a significant improvement in the classification rate.The proposed system is compared to k-nearest neighbours and neural networks using the same dataset. The results show that the proposed system outperforms these two classifiers in the four-class classification problem. The research project also investigates the system performance when the input image is cropped, resized or rotated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fears of early Childhhod: Writing in response to a study of Maurice Sendak</field><field name="creator">Sorin, Reesa Sheryl Malca</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at a series of stories written for children by Maurice Sendak.

These credential systems are very useful in anonymous communication as they have an interesting common feature which is the ability to combine encryption with access control. This feature allows participants to protect their credentials from being disclosed while running the protocols, which makes these credential systems a natural fit for privacy-preserving and anonymity-oriented applications. Since these systems have many similarities, interest has arisen in converting them from one to another. Consequently, a series of OSBE schemes based on ElGamal family signatures was proposed, along with a generic construction of SH from OSBE. According to this generic construction, any ElGamal family signature based OSBE scheme can be converted to SH within three communication moves, with the exception of the ElGamal and DSA signatures. To complement the previous result, we propose two three-move SH schemes based on ElGamal and DSA signatures, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the question of extending the two-party SH to a multi-party setting. We observe that almost all of the SH schemes can be constructed from particular key agreement schemes. Hence we implement an efficient ID-based Authenticated Group Key Agreement (AGKA) scheme, from which we can construct a multi-party SH scheme. Very recently, a new multi-party SH scheme has been proposed based on an unauthenticated group key agreement scheme ahead of our implementation. However, we note that there exists a drawback in this scheme, which may cause the leakage of a valid member's group affiliation in a failed multi-party SH protocol. Therefore, we propose a Group Secret Handshake (GSH) scheme that resists against this attack, and prove that our scheme is secure.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication of in-situ MgB2 thin films on Al2O3 substrate using off-axis PLD technique</field><field name="creator">Wu, Yi Sun</field><field name="description">In Chapter 1, I briefly discuss some fundamental theories and the history of superconductivity. A few examples are given for superconductor applications. At Chapter 2, a literature review of MgB2 is presented, with some discussion on its discovery, as well as the current research on this binary superconductor. In Chapter 3, the experimental system and other types of laboratory measurement and analysis equipment are introduced, such as those used for critical temperature Tc and critical current Jc measurements, microstructural analysis using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), etc. From Chapter 4 through Chapter 7, various ways of improving the fabrication of MgB2 thin films are discussed along with the corresponding results. In Chapter 4, I first report investigations on the vacuum level and background pressure in order to create an optimised environment inside the chamber for the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of MgB2 thin films on Al2O3 (Sapphire) substrates. I found that a vacuum of 9x10-8 Torr inside the deposition chamber was necessary before deposition to generate a stronger plasma of the ablating materials, but that a high purity argon background gas had to be introduced up to a pressure of 120m Torr to fabricate high quality MgB2 thin films. This result was employed in the experiments in the rest of this report. In Chapter 5, the effects of changing the annealing parameters, time (Tann) and temperature (Tann), are reported. The combined results from Tc measurements andXRD showed that the films with longer dwell times, up to 9 minutes at a moderate sintering temperature, have higher Tc and better crystal growth. We found that for films sintered at 700 &#730;aC, critical current densities, Jc, as high as 2x10-6 Acm-2 were achieved at 10K and 0.5T. However, Jc drops as the magnetic field increases. It is proposed that the improved Jc in low fields was due to the fine grains and enhanced density of the sample. In Chapter 6, I discuss the fabrication of MgB2 thin films with the addition of elemental Si. Silicon is a semiconductor and is very reactive with Magnesium to form Mg2Si, which can act as a source of pinning centres in our thin films, making it possible to improve the Jc dependence in magnetic field. The drawback of this is higher resisitivity and weaker grain connectivity, so a moderate amount of Si addition must be chosen. Also, the Si was added by using a switching target mechanism which will produce thin films of partial multilayer structures. Although the time for the Si deposition was short, the Si layers embedded in between the MgB2 layers were thin and usually broke during a high temperature sintering process. However, the defects which formed in between these layers generally had a two dimensional structure and their effect on the pinning properties due to this geometry is also discussed. A film with about 5 wt% of Si added was observed to have slightly decreased Tc and weaker field dependence.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of the thermal environment, clothing and auxiliary body cooling in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Joanne Nellie</field><field name="description">Extensive research into the physiological impact of wearing thermal protective clothing has been conducted for many years. However, the current literature does not provide a consensus concerning the interaction of heat strain and cognitive function. This project sought to investigate the problems associated with personnel working in uncompensable environmental conditions while wearing Australian Defence Force (ADF) protective clothing. Four separate investigations were conducted. The first was a field based study evaluating the thermal influences of operating a helicopter simulator. The second was a laboratory study evaluating the impact of wearing body armour on physiological and cognitive function. Thirdly, a theoretical evaluation of, the problems associated with performing work in an uncompensable heat stress environment and, the physical characteristics of various coolants and cooling systems were investigated. Finally, a laboratory investigation on the physiological and cognitive consequences of wearing a personal protective ensemble while performing exercise with and without an activated liquid-cooling garment. A significant reduction in flying performance was evident when pilots were heated to a mean skin temperature (TGsk) of~39EC compared to the other two conditions (~33EC and 37EC, P less than 0.05), using a water perfusion garment to achieve these target TGsk. However no obvious detriments in cognitive performancewere observed for the two laboratory based studies even though subjects were exposed to a significant thermal load, as determined by increases in TC, TGsk and fc (P less than 0.05). For the final study, where thermal strain was significantly higher in the hot-dry trial without cooling (P less than 0.05), resulting in a terminal rectal temperature that was 1.6EC higher than the thermoneutral condition, the liquid-cooling garment (water temperature 15EC) successfully prevented all detriments in physiological function observed during the hot-dry trial without cooling. It can therefore be concluded from this investigation that, individuals exposed to extreme environmental conditions while wearing protective ensembles, are at risk of developing increased thermal strain that may lead to heat illness. In terms of cognitive function assessment, this project failed to determine specifically, which areas of cognitive function are in fact adversely affected. However, a reduction in thermal strain can be achieved with the use of an auxiliary cooling device</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of inherently conducting polymers in ionic liquids</field><field name="creator">Mazurkiewicz, Jakub</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, the effect of ionic liquid (IL) or classical electrolyte (CE) employed on the redox behaviour of many inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) was investigated with the ultimate goal of producing flexible batteries. ICPs can be used in a range of unique applications, and also to replace many metal conductors or inorganic semiconductors. Commercialisation of ICPs has, however, been limited. Ion and solvent transport in ICPs during redox cycling almost universally leads to breakdown of redox activity and desired properties of the material. ILs comprise of neat ions in the form of a room temperature melt. ILs show great promise as novel electrolytes to enhance the stability of ICPs beyond that observed in CEs and paves the way to commercialisation of ICP devices.

The redox cycling stability of polypyrrole was increased over those of CE systems in the IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIPF6). The electroactivity in this system showed no degradation over 900 redox cycles. The use of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (bis) trifluoromethanesulfonimide (EMITFSI) also improved the redox stability of polypyrrole in comparison to the CE systems. The stable potential windows of polypyrrole were significantly improved in both IL systems compared to CEs. The transitional behaviour between ILs and CEs was investigated by diluting ILs in a common neutral solvent electrolyte, propylenecarbonate (PC). In such IL / CE mixtures,differences were noted in the electrolyte conductivity profile and ICP electroactivity with respect to concentration of IL. BMIPF6 exhibited a significantly higher degree of ion pairing than EMITFSI, and the strong ion pairing property of BMIPF6 is thought to be responsible for unique electrochemical observations absent from the ICP in EMITFSI systems. N-doping is an attractive feature of some ICPs and has promise in charge storage applications, providing significant driving potential differences of two or more volts against p-doped electrodes. As ILs were found to enhance redox stability of common pdoping processes in ICPs, investigations were conducted in Chapter 4 to see if the same was true for inherently unstable n-doping processes. Poly-3-p-flourophenylthiophene (P3PFTh) was chosen as a model n-doping system, due to its well published n-doping behaviour in classical electrolytes. Surprisingly, n-doping responses of P3PFTh in EMITFSI were very poor. The reasons behind this were explored by testing other n-dopable polymers in EMITFSI to isolate whether EMITFSI was inherently preventing n-doping, and P3PFTh was tested with different ILs to investigate P3PFTh / EMITFSI incompatibility. EMITFSI used as an electrolyte was found to decrease electroactivity of the n-doping processes in most polythiophenes, with the exception of polybithiophene (PBiTh). The stability of n-doping PBiTh in EMITFSI did not, however, improve to an extent that would allow derivative devices to be practical. Spectroelectrochemical Raman studies of the n-doping processes of polythiophenes in EMITFSI were conducted in-situ to reveal behaviour that may be responsible for poor electrochemical responses. Raman studies showed that both the p-doping and n-doping process in polythiophenes occurred with a &#8216;reverse&#8217; mechanism of ion expulsion upon doping (whereas doping processes of ICPs in CEs usually occur by ion insertion). The Raman studies also indicated that the physical structure of polythiophene had a large effect on the resulting electrochemistry, to an extent that impeded doping processes. The structure-activity relationships of P3PFTh were investigated by CV using a range of growth and cycling electrolytes. Observations were analysed chemometrically to identify the effects on electrochemical parameters of electrolyte component (anion or cation), whether the dominating effect was from growth or cycling electrolyte, and which particular doping / dedoping process was affected by these parameters. Chapter 5 describes electrochemical charge storage devices based on IL electrolytes using various substrates, polymers and configurations. The highest capacity device was based on polyaniline doped with ferrocene sulphonic acid on carbon fibre textile for both anode and cathode, with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) separator and EMITFSI electrolyte. The flexible charge storage device produced in this way had a maximum charge capacity of 58 mAh/g, but degraded quickly on cycling. The most stable device was constructed similarly to the highest capacity device, but used polypyrrole and poly- 3-methylthiophene electrodes, with maximum charge capacity of 17 mAh/g, remaining unchanged for 60 cycles.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of shipping and other vessel based activities in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area</field><field name="creator">Aston, James Peter</field><field name="description">The Great Barrier Reef sustains a variety of commercial and recreational activities and livelihoods including fishing, tourism, recreation and shipping. Those activities pose a source of harm to the biodiversity, use and amenity values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The threat of day-to-day shipping operations on the Reef&#8217;s ecosystem is largely unquantified but could represent a not inconsequential contribution to the overall levels of contaminants entering the Marine Park, potentially diminishing the amenity or water quality at sites which are already affected by other activities or susceptible to influxes of land sourced pollutants. There is also the potential for more serious impacts to the outstanding natural, social and economic values of the region following a major shipping accident. While the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is the principal custodian of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the administration of a suite of measures to regulate all ships and vessel activities in the region is shared with two other Commonwealth government authorities and one state government authority. The complexity of international and domestic shipping and environmental protection laws presents many challenges for the region&#8217;s responsible management. This thesis examines the environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the Reef from the operations of ships and other vessel based activities and the practical application and effect of regulatory measures that have been developed and implemented to remedy those impacts. It describes the origins, development and implementation of the key ship routeing initiatives in the form of compulsory pilotage, a vessel traffic service and provisions under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 to control use and access to high conservation zones. It also analyses recent developments at international and national law prescribing actions that can be taken to deal with operational vessel sourced waste discharges, the administrative arrangements for dealing with a maritime casualty as well the preparedness and response to oil and chemical spills. A significant part of the intellectual value of the thesis is derived from analysing the operation and interaction of international, Commonwealth and Queensland State marine pollution legislation and identifying issues which could affect the efficacy of those laws and related measures in protecting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The findings of the research support the premise that shipping and other vessel based activities within the Great Barrier Reef are generally conducted to a high standard. Nonetheless, as shipping and other vessel based activities continue to expand within the region, so does the risk of an accident or marine pollution event. It is suggested that the ship regulatory authorities should judiciously apply the precautionary principle and keep under review the widest possible range of ship safety, marine pollution prevention and environmental standards and measures available under international law to ensure the Great Barrier Reef remains a national and international icon.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/64</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a model for the continuing professional development of teachers: a qualitative investigation</field><field name="creator">Lalitha, Hettiarachchige Done Asie</field><field name="description">This study reviews the current short term basis professional development of teachers in Sri Lanka. The status of the Sri Lankan program is reviewed in detail with a review of international literature. In this study, theories and principles which provide the basis for teacher development and effective teacher professional practices are used to formulate the theoretical framework. The teacher development models studied within this framework are reviewed in relation to the nature of the Sri Lankan model to identify the elements which would be useful for incorporation to improve the model of short term basis continuing professional development of teachers. This study falls within the qualitative research paradigm. However, some simple quantitative analysis is included where the need was felt to highlight points of relevance. The respondents in this study are teachers, principals, teacher educators, program developers and implementers. The sample studied included a review of the role of the teacher centres which are considered central to all short term basis continuing teacher development in Sri Lanka. The data gathering techniques include focus group meetings, individual interviews, observations, document review and field notes. This study focuses primarily on the academic aspects of short term basis continuing professional development and not on administrative management aspects. Therefore, the sources for data collection were selected from sources of academic contribution. However, the data related to administrative and management aspect revealed by the academic staff were reviewed. Short Term Basis Continuous Professional Development (STBCPD) is taking place outside the schools controlled by the teacher centres. The findings reveal that this system has considerable limitations as well as advantages. Owing to various factors, teacher development inside the school is also problematic and cannot be carried out systematically within the school. It has become difficult to assess either teacher development or changes of the students&#65533; performance that can be attributed to short term basis continuing teacher development practices as currently practiced. The study recommends an integrated model of short term basis continuing professional development integrating teacher centre and school-based practices, implementing adult learning principles and approaches and mechanisms to assess performance. Further, the integrated model provides for sustainable and appropriate coordination among the responsible stakeholders in the field of short term basis continuous development of teachers in Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of yeast-based methods to screen for plant cytokinin-binding proteins</field><field name="creator">Wang, You</field><field name="description">Cytokinin is an important plant hormone that controls many aspects of plant growth and development. A great amount of research has been done regarding its function and recently some significant process made on its signal transduction pathway. However much remains to be discovered and in particular the identity of tokininbinding proteins that function as signal transducing receptors would be valuable information. This study aimed to develop two yeast-based methods, to search for plant cytokinin-binding proteins.To establish the yeast three-hybrid (Y-3-H) system and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) screening, four different novel 6-benzylamino purine (BAP)- dexamethasone conjugates and two kinds of biotinylated BAP conjugates were synthesized, respectively. The suitability of these specially designed cytokinin derivatives for use in the study of cytokinin-binding proteins were demonstrated by their activities in competing with the proven cytokinin signal molecule BAP in inducing a response in vivo in the Amaranthus bioassay.The design of the Y-3-H system was based on that reported by Licitra and Liu (1996), with modifications that included use of a different yeast host strain to allow positive selection for the LEU2-containing fish plasmid and creation of a new hook plasmid to make the expression of HIS3 in yeast host L40 useable as a reporter gene.  Hybrid plant-animal hormone molecules (baits) created in Chapter II allow the animal hormone moiety to be anchored to a fusion of a DNA binding domain (DBD) with an animal hormone receptor produced by hook plasmid. The DBD can then be held in juxtaposition with a transcriptional activation domain (AD) as part of fusion protein produced by fish plasmids to create a functional bipartite transcription factor, if the AD is fused with a plant hormone receptor protein. The novel hybrid hormone thus acts as a bridge between the DBD and AD and allows transcription from reporter genes that allow the identification of individual cells in a population transformed with a plant fusion library. Individuals that have received a receptor able to bind plant hormone can then transcribe genes that allow prototrophic growth while the majority of cells are auxotrophs. Such cells can also transcribe the LacZ gene that allows hydrolysis of the substrate 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylb-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to a blue product. The genes that encode the cytokinin-binding proteins can then be recovered from cells with those properties. All the components, as far as could be tested, were verified for their functions before assembling together for test.A quite different approach, based on the capacity of FACS to recognize and separate microscopic particles, was also used to recover yeast cells that were expressing Arabidopsis cDNAs that increased cytokinin binding. In this screen, the plant proteins did not need to be fusions with a transcriptional AD domain. If any yeast cell expressing cytokinin-binding protein on its outer membrane, FACS should be able to identify the cell from the whole population of cells expressing plant cDNAs by the increased retention of biotinylated BAP (synthesized in Chapter II) and its consequent binding of the fluorescent streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE). Then the sorted cell can be tested to confirm that its properties are altered by the introduced gene and the identity of the cytokinin-binding protein is revealed by sequencing that gene.Test screens have been conducted with the two methods. An Arabidopsis cDNA library and a maize cDNA library that were constructed in fusion with a transcription AD have been screened with the Y-3-H method, while some His-independent clones were observed, none of them could activate the other reporter gene LacZ. A non fusion cDNA library of Arabidopsis screened by the FACS method has resulted in some primary positives that warrant further testing. These results together with possible future improvements of the screen methods have been discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus influence on the response of  pasture plants to salinity</field><field name="creator">Cho-Ruk, Kanjanarat</field><field name="description">Soil salinity is a growing global problem, as the presence of salts in soils is known to impact on the growth of various plants. One feasible means suggested for limiting the impacts of salinity is the use of nutrient fertilisers. This project was initiated to access whether the use of phosphate fertiliser would benefit the growth of pasture plant species. The interaction of P and salinity in relation to the growth of pasture plants was studied using a series of experiments. The investigations included pot experiments, using sand cultures with salinity impositions, and natural saline soils in the greenhouse, plant nutrient uptake in saline conditions, by assessing tissue mineral contents. Soil P adsorption under saline conditions was also determined to assist in explaining the results of the pot experiments. P adsorption isotherms were measured for 3 NSW soils in various concentrations of NaCl. Different methods of salt addition (direct addition of salt solution, salt incubated soils, and different periods of time of soil in contact with salt solution) were applied to the studied soils. Salt addition increased P adsorption significantly in all 3 soils. However, there was no significant difference in P adsorption when varying the concentrations of salt (0.003-0.12mol/L NaCl). Salinity increased P adsorption in soils but further increases in NaCl concentration did not increase P adsorption. Extended contact time between soils and NaCl solution appeared to reduce the overall P adsorption capacity in soils. Plants from 5 pasture species were grown in pots with suboptimum, optimum, and high P levels in saline cultures to compare yields. Salinity affected plant seed germination in all species by reducing the numbers of sown seeds germinated and slowing the germination rate. At the highest salinity level used (12 dS/m), all seeds failed to germinate. Considering the germination rate, the salt tolerance ranked from ryegrass, birdsfoot trefoil, orchard grass = red clover and white clover. Under normal experimental conditions in sand culture, 25 ppm P as NaH(subscript2)PO(subscript4) solution was determined as the optimum P level for all pasture species. Insufficient and excessive levels of P caused injury in plants and affected yields and plant tissue mineral contents. Ryegrass with various salinity treatments (0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 dS/m) showed that salinity reduced ryegrass yields significantly as the degree of salinity was increased despite the optimum P additions (25 ppm). Salinity impacts varied during the plant growth development. When plants grew older, their salt tolerance improved, and the plants showed more tolerance to salinity as they reached maturity. Salinity also reduced P uptake by ryegrass plants. Plants responded positively up to certain limits to P additions (17 and 25 ppm) in non-saline treatments. In saline treatments, plants responded differently over the whole range of added P. Positive results were obtained when P was added up to 17 and 25 ppm. Further increases in added P did not increase plant yields; indeed, negative results or no change were obtained. Therefore, over a wide range of studied P, plants showed both positive and negative effects as well as no effect of P in saline conditions. Increasing added P increased P content in plant tissues. In all treatments where salinity was imposed, salinity increased Na and Cl contents in plant tissues. However, the effects of salinity on other mineral constituents were highly crop specific. In a natural saline soil culture, there was no mass response of red clover and ryegrass yields to P additions. Increased P level in the treatments did not show any plant capacity to overcome the effect of salinity. Plants still showed symptoms of salinity injury, such as yellowing and leaf burn. Salinity therefore was the main retarding factor. Increasing P fertilisation in a natural saline soil increased P content in plant tissues. This current study indicates that the interactive effects between salinity and P depended on P range and salinity level. Plants responded differently over a wide range of P at low and medium levels of salinity. However, P additions at any concentration were not able to assist plants overcome the effects of salinity at extremely high saline conditions, as poor soil structure and plant physiological disorders limited plant responses to added P. Limiting the development of soil salinity is the major way to reduce its impact on crop production.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital rights management for smart containment objects</field><field name="creator">Fares, Tony Yussef</field><field name="description">Copyright law has been created to satisfy a variety of objectives including promoting knowledge in communities and encouraging authors and content producers to create more content. Originally, copyright measurements were proposed as means of controlling access to content. Over time, they have been defined as the degree of control authors or distributors can exercise over their works. Technologists and smart-device manufacturers identified such new rights management market, and invented new encryption algorithms and devices with the belief that technical solutions alone could provide full content protection. A clear differentiation must be drawn between the actual and expected results of rights management technologies. These technologies may reduce unauthorized content access, but cannot fully protect content. This is because security devices may be circumvented and security solutions may be attacked through their weakest point.Further research about copyright management revealed that this is not a new concept.  Copyright issues and infringements have already been in existence in different shapes and forms since the pre-digital age. The growth in Internet use led to the definition of a new form of rights management known as Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is defined as the management of intellectual property exchanged in digital form. DRM, after more than twenty years since information digitization started, is still considered by most businesses as complex, expensive, and hard to adopt. Most content anagement businesses perceive DRM automation as an unnecessary step since it may increase complexities and costs in communications with other peers, suppliers, or customers. DRM is complex for a variety of reasons and one of the major contributors to the complexity is the lack of standardization among various DRM products available on the market today.Given such DRM complexity, this dissertation has been developed to include objectives that address two main aspects of DRM: First, providing a comprehensive, yet simple, definition of DRM. This has been achieved through the definition of a DRM framework called the Holistic Rights Framework (HRF), which covers social, legal, and echnological facets of DRM and their relationships. HRF is intended to provide a useful model that can be used as a reference by anyone interested in or impacted by copyright legislation. The HRF may provide additional benefits for technologists through better understanding of legal and social factors and implications related to DRM, thus resulting in better-designed products with the possibility of higher consumption or usage.Second, this dissertation addresses one example of the HRF technical facet: the integration of Rights Expression Language (REL) and Content Packaging. This section describes how an extension to a REL (i.e. XrML) and Content Packaging (i.e. IMS Content Packaging) has been achieved. The result is a set of methods or APIs that can be invoked as a web service to manage rights across containment objects. Those APIs may also be invoked by rendering application-toquery rights before rendering content. Such rights management and control over the smallest sub-object in each containment object preserve authors&#8217; rights and encourage them to produce more. This concept contributes to digital objects&#8217; re-use and helps in preserving owners&#8217; rights over their creation when they are exchanged or organized as part of a containment object. It also helps consumers by giving them the choice to access only the information they want rather than accessing the whole containment object, thus costing less. In addition, it is complemented with a few examples illustrating its applicability and usage in real life. Those examples cover how a user or an object may automatically query or set rights across a containment object using the developed API. A proof of this concept has been achieved through the development and delivery of a set of APIs and demonstrators capable of invoking various DRM-related methods on a containment object.The contribution to knowledge by this research is summarized in two main areas: 1) conceptual; through the new definition of a DRM framework with the intention to increase awareness among various DRM stakeholders towards DRM facets; and 2) technical; through integrating REL and Content Packaging that preserves content producers&#8217; rights and encourages them to produce more.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A predictive GIS methodology for mapping potential mining induced rock falls</field><field name="creator">Zahiri, Hani</field><field name="description">Coal mining operations impact on various types of natural features, including cliff lines, steep slopes and natural watercourses. The introduction of longwall mining has led to subsidence depression due to the changing geometry of the mined out area. Subsidence can destabilise cliff lines and increase the probability of rock falls and cliff collapse. The current process for managing subsidence in New South Wales (NSW) involves the preparation of a Subsidence Management Plan (SMP). One approach for managing the results of subsidence is to develop pre-mining methodologies for assessing potential mining impacts. This thesis deals with a quantitative Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based methodology for mapping potential mine subsidence-induced rock falls along cliffs and steep slopes along the Nepean River Gorge. The proposed methodology is developed using Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) method within a GIS framework to derive a probabilistic model of rock falls associated with mining-induced subsidence. The thesis uses ten (10) known mining-induced rock falls associated with longwall workings along the Cataract River to evaluate the impact of restricting mining to a region greater than 50 m of the Nepean cliffs. The results represent significant reduction of probabilities of rock fall occurrence when mining is conducted in this way.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated methodology for stress-based fatigue assessment of steel railway bridges</field><field name="creator">Sorrenson, Peter James</field><field name="description">Ageing infrastructure is a widespread problem, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Reliable structural integrity and remaining life assessment are essential for the resolution of the problem. Ageing railway bridges is a particularly difficult subset of the ageing infrastructure problem. There is a complex array of issues that face integrity and remaining life assessment of railway bridges. The structural conditions of railway bridges may change from site to site, even where bridges are supposedly of the same design. Structural conditions may also change over the life of any particular bridge. Dynamic interaction, between railway vehicles and railway bridge structures, has a dramatic effect on structural response and therefore remaining life. This dynamic interaction often requires complex modelling techniques in integrity assessment. For assessment of railway bridges, different assumptions and different methods of assessment are often used, making repeatable and verifiable assessment difficult. In this research, in order to work toward addressing the problem of ageing steel railway bridges, a clear, repeatable methodology for high-level structural assessment has been formulated. The method integrates state-of-the-art modelling, testing and fatigue code tools, and uses dynamic digital data for testing, modelling and assessment. The method is demonstrated by assessment of the steel girder approach spans of the Mullet Creek Railway Bridge, Dapto, NSW, Australia. The method developed in this research begins with a finite element sensitivity model, that is a finite element model that permits variations in joint fixity and support conditions. This model is tuned and validated, using transient digital data from the dynamic field-test response of a slow moving vehicle of known load, through a dynamic analytical model intermediate step. The dynamic field-test response of normal traffic is then recorded and axle loads are identified from the digitised measured response, using the dynamic analytical model as a transfer function. Identified loads are applied to the tuned finite element sensitivity model and the dynamic stress history generated for virtually any bridge component. Dynamic stress histories are then entered directly into a software system, which estimates remaining life via several international fatigue codes. After verification of the finite element sensitivity model against dynamic field-test results, loading and structural conditions may be adjusted and the integrity and remaining life of the structure evaluated for virtually any combination of structural and loading condition. In the demonstration of the method, three components of the Mullet Creek Railway Bridge approach spans have been chosen for structural integrity and remaining life assessment. Structural conditions and applied loading conditions have been altered and the impact of the changes investigated. From the structural integrity and remaining life assessment, two locations have been identified as fatigue critical and recommendations have been made for structural changes and ongoing inspection. The most significant contribution of this research is expected to be the complete methodology, its clarity and repeatability, its integration throughout and the way in which it deals with the difficult problem of true dynamic response. Other contributions have been made within individual steps of the methodology, where attempts have been made to extend current research. These contributions include: the development of a technique for modelling the dynamic response of structures in finite element software; a dynamic analytical model for beams with rotationally stiffened supports subjected to moving distributed loads; extension of load identification theory to distributed loads on non-simply supported beams; and a comparative study of several key international fatigue codes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of kindergarten children's multiliterate practices in their homes</field><field name="creator">Turner, Margaret</field><field name="description">Children who enter kindergarten bring to the school environment, a wide range of abilities in literacy. Prior literacy experiences in the home and the wider community have been shown to contribute towards these wide ranging abilities and, consequently, future success in literacy at school.Our society today, though, is changing rapidly. Our task, therefore, as educators is to prepare our children to function in a future civilization created by the biggest leap in technology since the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago. We have entered a time when advances in technology are having an important effect on literacy development. The literacy needs and demands of a changing society must be addressed in school when children are very young.This inquiry was an exploration at three Sydney metropolitan schools of kindergarten children&#8217;s multiliterate practices in their homes. The inquiry endeavoured to establish the relationship between these practices and the socioeconomic backgrounds and gender of these children. It also endeavoured to establish the relationship between the kindergarten children&#8217;s practices and skills with the expectations of policy and curriculum documents in the first year at school of the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education and Training (DET).  The following research questions guided this inquiry:*	What are the multiliterate practices in the homes of kindergarten children at three Sydney metropolitan schools? *	What is the relationship between these multiliterate practices and socioeconomic background? *	What is the relationship between these multiliterate practices and gender?*	How do the multiliterate practices and skills of these kindergarten children relate to the expectations, in the first year at school, of current policy and curriculum of the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education and Training (DET)?The inquiry was qualitative in nature and employed mixed methodologies of ethnographic techniques, case study and narrative inquiry.There were three phases in this inquiry; the initial phase that involved surveying 123 kindergarten parents in three schools; the immersion phase that involved observing five case study children in their homes as they engaged in a range of literacy practices including print and paper-based literacies and techno-literacies, and the analysis of the NSW DET documents relevant to literacy learning in the first year at school. It was found that while socioeconomic background and gender differences existed, all kindergarten children experienced a wide range of multiliterate practices in their homes that comprised print and paper-based literacies and techno-literacies. It was also found that parents held different views about the role that techno-literacies played in learning to read and write and these views seemed to mirror those of early years teachers, namely that print and paper-based skills were more highly valued for young emergent readers and writers.It was also found that assessment of kindergarten children on entry to school did not recognise young children&#8217;s techno-literacy skills in their out-of-school worlds and while curriculum documents included an extensive range of techno-literacy experiences and expectations of learning by the end of the first year at school, schools needed to do more in providing teaching and learning programs that valued young children&#8217;s multiliterate experiences.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of mental health problems and types of treatment used in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Koka, Betty E</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea (PNG) is culturally diverse with an estimated 800 distinct languages and a population of 5 million people. These diverse cultures and languages influence help-seeking behaviour, expressions of illness, presentation of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment decisions. In addition to the complex influence of culturallinguistic factors on mental health and illness, inadequate resources limit PNG&#8217;s specialist mental health services. PNG has one psychiatrist per million people and one registered psychiatric nurse for every 70,000 people. As a result, the bulk of mental health care is provided by general health workers in various types of health care facilities in the community. Little is known about the types of mental health problems and treatment approaches adopted by health workers in the field. There is evidence from studies in other developing countries that general health workers lack understanding and knowledge in mental health issues and this limits their ability to make appropriate diagnoses and deliver appropriate treatments. Earlier studies in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have described mental health problems seen by psychiatrists. However, the types of mental health problems and treatment approaches used by general health workers have not been assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the types of mental health problems and treatments that general health workers work with in PNG. The study also sought to assess general health workers levels of knowledge and confidence in understanding and managing mental health problems. The study recruited 209 general health workers including, health extension officers (HEOs), nursing officers (NOs) and community health workers (CHWs) from a range of health care settings. This study used a three-part questionnaire that included a combination of structured questions written in both English and Neo-Melanesian (Tok Pisin). Part 1 assessed health workers knowledge and confidence in diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. Part 2 asked them to provide a detailed review of the three most recent mental health cases they had managed. Part 3 involved pre-post workshop assessment of knowledge and skill using participant responses to three video case vignettes that were role-played in Tok Pisin. Data was collected from the four regions of PNG at four 5-day long regional mental health-training workshops. Pre-post training measures were collected to evaluate the difference of training at improving diagnosis and treatment approaches suggested by participants in response to the video-case vignettes. The results showed that general health workers had received little training in mental health issues and that they tended to lack confidence in identifying and managing mental health problems. Respondents provided data on 282 patients and results indicated that patients on their caseloads frequently received both western and culture specific diagnoses. The most common diagnoses were schizophrenia, depression, substance use disorder, sorcery and spirit possession. The most common treatment approach used was medication. Medication use appeared to be based on what was available rather than effectiveness and appropriateness. Those diagnosed with a culture specific disorder were almost twice as likely to receive traditional treatment and even half of those who did not receive a culture specific diagnosis went on to receive some form of traditional treatment. Psychological treatment (counselling) was also commonly used as part of the treatment process. Pre-training measures assessing video case vignettes had high numbers of &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; responses suggesting a lack of confidence and knowledge regarding diagnosis and treatment planning. At the post-training assessments the number of &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; responses decreased suggesting increases in confidence, but there were also increases in the provision of the &#8220;correct&#8221; diagnosis and more appropriate treatments for some cases. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to training needs of general health workers and the provision of culturally appropriate treatment approaches. Specifically, suggestions are made for better integrating policy recommendations regarding the implementation of traditional treatment of mental health problems with western mental health approaches.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Animating the mind: an analysis of animation as a representational mode for learning</field><field name="creator">Hewson, Lindsay</field><field name="description">The relative value of animation as an educational medium depends on a number of factors within the medium itself, the manner in which it is integrated with an overall educational design, and with the levels of expertise possessed by the learner in the subject domain and with the medium.  This study began to compare animation with informationally equivalent text and graphic modes of presentation in Chemistry, but in doing so, uncovered the roles of expertise and metacognition in its effective use. An initial pilot comparative study with undergraduate Chemistry students revealed that higher-ability students had preferred text-only instruction and lower-ability students had been drawn to the animated version. The text-based instructional group performed significantly better in a standard post-test than did the graphic or animation groups. Subsequent redistribution of the sample in a main study overcame this bias and no significant difference in student performance could be attributed to the mode of presentation used.  Follow-up interviews with both high- and low-ability students, as well as the expert/teachers of the group revealed the cognitive functioning of each group in response to the animated and text-based instruction and suggested ways to improve the use of animation in learning. A range of visual literacy skills and a level of metacognition combined with explicit instruction and practice with the medium are essential for learning from animated instruction.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New material: a novella, and the accompanying exegesis, How to log into the book: cyborgs and fiction</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Lucy</field><field name="description">The novella New Material explores the intersections between fictional space, cyber space and mythic space, through three characters&#8217; narratives: Jo, his cousin Mei and Lee Wei Hong.  Set in Singapore in 2007, the novella is narrated by each of these characters, whose voices interrupt and layer one another&#8217;s stories.  Jo is a teen hacker and computer expert who lives fully immersed in a networked world.  Mei has come from Australia to stay with Jo&#8217;s family, fleeing her parents&#8217; divorce.  She is an avid reader and uses fictional space as an escape route from her troubled family.  Thirdly, the older Lee Wei Hong, an offset printer, whose narration takes the form of a statement to the police.It is seeing himself as his online avatar through his cousin&#8217;s eyes that Jo begins transformation and when Mei insists they need to experience a rainstorm Jo comes into contact with physical reality in a way he has been avoiding.  Mei&#8217;s journey through Singapore leads her to explore her roots and she and Jo come to know one another better through talking about their shared grandmother&#8217;s spiritual heritage.  However, Jo&#8217;s double-dealing with gamers online leads him to be assaulted in a back alley.  Strangely, the alley is full of paper. The night of the hungry ghosts sees Jo and Mei immersed in the novel they salvaged.  The narrative entangles the two of them, as they become part of the story.Lee Wei Hong&#8217;s confession is the lead-up to his &#8216;crime&#8217;.  During the course of his day he reads and falls in love with a book, the physical book that he has been working on.  When he discovers that his work will not be available to the public, but that the novel will only be available online he is moved to act.  In a state of passion he takes the printed pages of the review copy his company has, and throws them off the tenth storey of the National Library.  This is his criminal act.These are the pages that Jo and Mei have found, read and also been inspired to act upon.  Through his hacking Jo has unearthed a series of emails that read well as fiction.  He and Mei decide to send them on to the author to influence his next book. Exegesis &#8211; How to Log into the Book: Cyborgs and FictionAbstractThe exegesis situates the novella New Material in the surrounding landscape of literary fiction writing and theoretical posthumanism in two ways.  First, it discusses the novel within the framework of two other novels, Peter Carey&#8217;s My Life as a Fake and Jeanette Winterson&#8217;s The PowerBook, both of which deal in very different ways with the cyborg within fiction, as both constructed character and constructed author.  Secondly, the exegesis draws on the work of theorists and researchers Elizabeth Grosz&#8217; Space, Time, Perversion - the Politics of Bodies, Donna Haraway&#8217;s "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology and Socialist Feminisim in the Late Twentieth Century", N Katherine Hayles&#8217;  How We Became Post-Human: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics and Sherry Turkle&#8217;s Life on Screen; Identity and the Age of the Internet.  These four writers&#8217; works are used as metaphorical global positioning systems to discuss the novella New Material, and map the territories where its concerns overlap with those of the Carey and Winterson novels.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of colour polymorphism in the painted dragon, Ctenophorus pictus</field><field name="creator">Healey, Mo</field><field name="description">Many studies of colour polymorphism across a range of taxa have shown that morphs proliferate by operating different reproductive tactics. To investigate whether this is the case with our model species, the Australian painted dragon lizard Ctenophorus pictus, we characterised a number of morph-specific traits. We demonstrate that red-headed males beat yellow-headed males in staged contests for females and that this is linked to what appears to be a convention of red dominance in male-male interactions set very early in ontogeny, long before colouration has developed. Red dominance was also observed in the field, where red males have territories with higher perch density and begin their territory defense three weeks before yellow males in some years. Red males also have higher testosterone levels than yellow males, which may provide a potential proximate link to the behavioural differences between them. 	In female choice experiments on single males of different colours, females did not preferentially associate with a particular morph. However, when females were allowed to choose between pairs of males of the same versus different colours, they preferred to associate with male pairs that were polymorphic. We suggest that this may be the result of selection arising from polyandrous mating benefits and show experimentally that polyandry results in increased hatching success.	Sperm competition trials in the lab showed that although yellow males copulated for a shorter period of time, they sired three times as many offspring as red males. Our mating experiments also showed that yellow males had significantly larger testes in relation to body condition than red males and that sperm storage played a highly significant role in male reproductive success.	These morph-specific differences are indicative of different reproductive strategies, with red males being more coercive or better mate guarders than yellow males, whilst yellow males may employ a sneaker type strategy to gain matings. However, we could not verify the distinct differences in morph-specific reproductive tactics in the wild that we would have predicted from our trials in captivity.	For example, inherent red dominance could result in yellow males being marginalised to poorer quality territories in terms of access to females, food, perch sites or shade. However, with a territory acquisition experiment in the wild, we found no significant effect of colour category per se, although on average red males remained closer to the release sites (our proxy for territory acquisition ability) than yellow males. We would also predict ongoing disruptive selection on space use, with red males defending well-defined territories and yellow males having larger and more loosely defined territories. Selection analysis showed that selection on space use in a natural population was not disruptive in either of the two years studied. Thus, divergence of male reproductive strategies in our model species does not seem to be related to differences in space use or territoriality.	If yellow males employ a sneaker strategy, we would expect them to sire more offspring per copulation and have a greater proportion of offspring from clutches with mixed paternity. However, we show that the frequency of mixed paternity in the wild is low (&lt; 20 %), and that all morphs on average have the same number of offspring sired per year.	A contributing factor to this difference in results could be habitat constraints on the evolution and expression of morph-specific behaviour and their evolutionary divergence in painted dragons. Habitat heterogeneity in our population (along a man-made fire trail) may be too low to allow each morph to exploit their optimal strategies, and we show that polyandry is significantly more common on territories where vigilance opportunities are relatively poorer.			Painted dragons are also polymorphic in bib colour. Red males with a bib are in better body condition than red males that lack a bib, which contrasts sharply to yellow males, in which males with a bib are in poorer condition than yellow males that lack a bib. In a field experiment we found that males without a bib lost within-clutch paternity significantly more often to rivals than bibbed males. We increased the work load of males and compared &#8216;loaded&#8217; males against controls with respect to how they maintained body mass during the mating season. Unexpectedly, bibbed males consistently lost more body weight across all treatments and controls. Thus, higher quality signalers may be more efficient at converting signals into fitness, in spite of higher marginal costs. 	During the last three months we have managed to stimulate cryptic females to express their underlying colouration using testosterone implants, and we are currently collecting data that could allow us to elucidate the genetic inheritance of this fascinating colour polymorphism.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/71</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the effect of non-clinical change on Australian GPs? : a survey of regional and rural general practitioners</field><field name="creator">Dalley, Andrew</field><field name="description">Australian General Medical Practices have undergone substantial change over the last two decades. This thesis identifies those changes and examines how a cohort of regional and rural general practitioners has responded to them. It also identifies the impact of environmental change on the GPs, their practices and their patients.The methodology is largely qualitative, based on interviews with 20 practicing GPs in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions of Australia. Case studies were developed with the assistance of a group of GP academics from each mainland state, meeting as an electronic Delphi group. The case studies were selected to be of relevance and importance to most GPs in order to stimulate discussion about a defined environmental change.The data were categorised using a stem-based framework supported by the software product Nvivo. Themes were identified and refined as the transcript of each interview was analysed.  Themes were then categorised according to the response of the GPs&#8217; to change and the impact of change on the GP, the general practice and the general practice patient.The findings help in understanding how a cohort of GPs have responded to changes in their environment, how government has introduced reforms, and what response can be made to benefit the longer term delivery of primary care services in Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detailed molecular analysis of antibiotic resistance regions within a collection of multi-drug resistant Salmonella spp. from Australian sources</field><field name="creator">Levings, Renee S.</field><field name="description">Salmonella spp., in particular Salmonella Typhimurium is an important zoonotic pathogen both here in Australia and internationally. Over the past few decades the use of antimicrobials in human, agricultural and aquacultural settings has created significant selection pressures, giving rise to multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria, including Salmonella. The acquisition and dissemination of the genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance has been largely attributed to mobile genetic elements, including Class 1 integrons and the gene cassettes they contain. The initial aim of this study was to examine a collection of 136 multiply resistant Salmonella of different serovars from varying Australian sources (predominately animal and to a lesser extent human) for the presence of Class 1 integrons and to identify the gene cassettes present. Using PCR to amplify up specific regions within the Class 1 integron structure, 51.4% of the isolates examined were found to contain the Class 1 integron associated intI1 integrase. All of these, apart from 11 isolates, contained cassette arrays which were characterised using restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The gene cassettes identified among the collection were almost solely responsible for resistance to trimethoprim and aminoglycosides. The dfrA5 gene cassette (responsible for resistance to trimethoprim) was the most prevalent cassette, particularly among the bovine isolates. Three new gene cassettes responsible for resistance to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim and lincosamides (aacCA5, dfrB6 and linG, respectively) were identified. SGI1 (Salmonella Genomic Island 1), a 43 kb chromosomal island known to contain a large multi-drug resistance integron, In104 was found to be present in 10 experimental isolates and associated with 4 new serovars, namely Kiambu, Dusseldorf, Cerro and Emek. The integron in the Salmonella Emek strain was found to have inserted via transposition at a unique site within the island backbone and this structure has been named SGI2. This unique insertion site suggests that SGI2 has evolved independently of SGI1.A second collection of multi-drug resistant  almonella Paratyphi BdT+ isolates sourced from human infections in Melbourne and the corresponding home aquaria of infected patients were examined for clonality and the presence of SGI1. All S. Paratyphi BdT+ from infected individuals were indistinguishable from the isolates from their respective fish tanks, using IS200 profiling techniques and pulse field gel electrophoresis of XbaI digested chromosomal DNA. SGI1 (containing the aadA2 and blaP1 gene cassettes) was found to be present in all the S. Paratyphi BdT+ isolates examined. This is the first definitive molecular study showing that ornamental fish tanks are a reservoir for multiply resistant Salmonella  aratyphi BdT+. Studies examining the  molecular mechanisms involved in  antimicrobial resistance, and the way in which mobile elements are incorporated and clustered into large multi-drug resistance regions such as SGI1, provide useful information needed for the ongoing surveillance of multiply resistant Salmonella and other bacterial pathogens involved in outbreaks domestically and internationally.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of over reinforced HSC helically confined beams</field><field name="creator">Elbasha, Nuri Mohamed</field><field name="description">The technology of high strength concrete and high strength steel have improved over the last decade although high strength concrete is still more brittle than normal strength concrete. As this brittleness increases, particularly with the use of over reinforced sections, they may, suddenly fail without any warning.The research reported in this thesis deals with the installation of helical confinement in the compression zone of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams. This study is divided into three parts as follows:1) State of the Art &amp; Literature Review This part deals with state of the art and literature review. Helical confinement is more effective than rectangular ties, compression longitudinal reinforcement and steel fibres in increasing the strength and ductility of confined concrete. Helical reinforcement upon loading increases the ductility and compressive strength of axially loaded concrete due to resistance to lateral expansion caused by Poisson&#8217;s effect. Based on this concept helical reinforcement could be used in the compression zone of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams. The effectiveness of helical confinement depends on different important variables such as helical pitch and diameter. Thus there is a need for an experimental programme VI to prove that installing helical confinement in the compression zone of an overreinforced concrete beam enhances its strength and ductility and to study the behaviour of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams subjected to different variables.2) The Experimental Programme &amp; Test Analysis This part deals with an experimental programme and analysis of test results. Extensive experimental work was done because the beams should be full size in order to accurately represent real beams. Twenty reinforced concrete beams, 4 m long &#61655;&#61472;200 mm wide &#61655;&#61472;300 mm deep were helically confined in the compression zone and then tested in the civil engineering laboratory at the University of Wollongong. In this programme the following areas were studied: the effect of helical pitch, helical diameter, concrete compressive strength and longitudinal reinforcement ratio, on the behaviour of over-reinforced HSC helically confined beams.3) Analytical Models to Predict the Strength &amp; Ductility This part deals with the analytical models used to predict the strength and ductility of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams based on the findings of this study. A comparison between the experimental and predicted results shows an acceptable agreement. This study concludes that helical reinforcement is an effective method for increasing the strength and ductility of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiation hardness study of high purity silicon and the development of a radiation damage monitoring system for silicon devices in mixed radiation fields</field><field name="creator">Reinhard, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an experimental study into the radiation hardness of high purity silicon. This material is principally used in the manufacture of silicon based microstrip detectors and other similar devices. Radiation detector test structures which had been fabricated on the base of different types of silicon were exposed to ~1 MeV neutrons. This was done to determine the role of different impurities in the formation of radiation induced crystallographic defects within the silicon lattice. Oxygenated silicon, nitrogenised silicon and silicon containing the standard residual impurities was investigated. The effect of the deep level states associated with the defects on the detector electrical properties was also studied. At the relatively high neutron fluence employed, up to 7.5x10(superscript 13) n.cm(superscript -2), the conventional capacitance based Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) technique is not applicable. In order to detect and measure the properties of the defects a new technique was used known as Optical Deep Level Transient Conductance Spectroscopy (ODLTCS). Spectral features identified in the ODLTCS spectra were attributed to known radiation induced defects in silicon through the comparison of the measured energy levels of the associated deep level states and the measured introduction rates with data contained in the literature. Using ODLTCS the kinetics of the growth and contraction of particular defect concentrations in each of the irradiated detector types was measured as a function of room temperature annealing. Correlation in the evolution of the radiation induced C(subscript i)-O(subscript i) and the short term annealing of the effective impurity concentration (N[subscript eff]) was observed. Based on this finding a microscopic explanation for the improved radiation hardness of oxygenated silicon is described. Other possible mechanisms of defect engineering were also investigated. No deep level defect identified from the ODLTCS spectra could be attributed to the long term reverse anneal of N(subscript eff). This suggested that the responsible defect had a energy state outside the ODLTCS detection limit of less than (0.16 eV) as measured from either the conduction or valence band edge. Significant reduction in the production rate of the V-O defect was observed in nitrogenised silicon. Evidence supporting possible metastability of the V-O defect was also obtained. Another important aspect of this research was the development of technologies for use in the on-line monitoring of radiation damage to silicon devices in mixed radiation fields. It is shown that a PIN Dosimeter diode which has been calibrated in an epithermal neutron beam in terms of (?, see abstract in 01Front file) can be used to measure (?, see abstract in 01Front file) in a fast neutron field. This finding supports the use of a PIN Dosimeter Diode for measuring (?, see abstract in 01Front file) in neutrons fields with any arbitrary energy spectra. The response of the PIN Dosimeter Diode in a high energy electron field in terms of (?, see abstract in 01Front file) is studied. Based on experimental findings it is reasoned that PIN Dosimeter Diode can provide a universal means of measuring dose associated with Non Ionising Energy Loss (NIEL) in silicon when exposed to any mixed radiation field in terms of (?, see abstract in 01Front file). Sensors for measuring does due to Ionising Energy Loss (IEL) in SiO(subscript 2) when exposed to mixed radiation fields were also investigated. It is shown that an IEL sensor based on photodetector is not suitable in a radiation environment containing NIEL type radiations. An alternative sensor in the form of MOSFET is found to suitably radiation hard against dose associated with NIEL and able to measure IEL over a wide range of response. Based on the MOSFET and PIN Dosimeter Diode results a Radiation Damage Monitoring System is designed for the measurement of damage to electronic devices in mixed radiation fields. The system was implemented in the Belle experiment at the KEK B-Factory in Japan, and within the lepton collider at SLAC in the USA.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sea control &amp; maritime power projection for Australia: maritime air power and air warfare</field><field name="creator">Menhinick, Richard T</field><field name="description">Australia is a maritime nation in one of the most complex open ocean, littoral and archipelagic maritime regions in the world. The sea is the defining physical characteristic in the region. The overwhelming significance of this is that Australia has no land borders. This is a strategic advantage that must be better understood to avoid it becoming a strategic liability. Strategic realities endure. There are many more effective ways to overcome Australia other than via a military invasion. However, defence against such an invasion is currently the prime force structure determinant in Australian defence planning. As an alternative to this, Australia should better appreciate that a mature maritime capability would provide the mobility and power projection to deter aggressors engaged in operations against Australias interests at distance from Australia itself. Such an understanding would lead to the implementation of a credible maritime strategy. Underpinning such a maritime strategy is the strategic concept of sea control. Sea control requires control of the air. Without sea control maritime power projection cannot occur and forces cannot be operated ashore. Additionally trade to and from Australia can be interdicted at will. However, the central role of sea control for Australias strategic security remains obscured by Australias consistent continentalist approach. It is time to bring maritime strategy to the fore, to re-engage the aircraft carrier issue and to stress the fundamental imperative for capable surface combatants. This would ensure that sea control is the enabler that underpins Australias defence policy. A mature Australia should relegate the vitriolic single-service oriented debates that concluded in 1983 about aircraft carriers to that era. A study should be conducted to rigorously review the technology, operational concepts and strategic realities of 2003 to 2040, with respect to Australias maritime strategic circumstances. As the Australian Defence Force makes decisions on new projects that will affect force structure for the next 30 years, a maritime sea control and power projection requirement should input significantly to the new aerospace combat capability, Project Air 6000, and the project for the maritime air warfare capability, Project Sea 4000.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into thermionic cooling for domestic refrigeration</field><field name="creator">Lough, Benjamin C.C.</field><field name="description">Thermionic refrigeration using semiconductor heterostructures is examined theoretically and experimentally. A theory of single-barrier devices is first developed where two classes of single-barrier devices are defined and compared. So-called class 1 devices are found to always perform better. A theory of multiple-barrier devices based on class 1 barriers is then developed using a numerical solution. Experimentally, three generations of 10-barrier devices based on A1(subscript x)Ga(subscript 1-x)As-GaAs heterostructures were made and electrically characterised. This material is by no means ideal (as will be discussed) but was used to availability and because, at the commencement of this work, had never been used for this purpose before. Thermal measurements were made to determine if any cooling occurred at room temperature. No cooling was observed but the electrical characteristics allowed for examination of the models developed. It was found that the earlier models used did not accurately model the I-V characteristics of the devices. This was attributed to the fact that the initial models did not take space-charge into account. A more robust numerical model is developed in which the I-V characteristics of devices are predicted much more accurately. This model is then used to design new generations of devices. The work concludes by recommending a next generation design in which substantially more cooling is expected compared to the samples examined here. The probability of cooling being observed in the future is therefore increased. The types of devices described here will always be hindered because of heat conduction. Other methods incorporating thermionic emission, such as an opto-thermionic system in which removed heat is given off as light, may ultimately prove to be the best solution. This aside, it is hoped that the work presented here will contribute to the understanding of the field.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The solitary notations</field><field name="creator">Kuo, Hsiu-Li</field><field name="description">This study investigates imagery from twentieth century art presenting the fluctuation of the human psyche, and historical western imagery revealing the mortal condition of human corporeality. The exploration of the interdisciplinary historical aspect of Surrealism (Rubin: 1968, Alexandrian: 1970, Bigsby: 1972), womens art (Orenstein: 1973, Chadwick: 1985), anatomical illustration (Roberts: 1992, Cazort: 1996), and death-related photography (Sante: 1992, Burns: 1990, 1998, OConnor: 1999) is an attempt to attain a coherent sense of being a human in the natural world. The Solitary Notations explores the concept of unveiling what has been concealed. Examining what is hidden underneath the visible in both a cultural and metaphorical sense is investigated in both theoretical and creative research. This study includes Surrealist art that explored the unconscious realm of human personality. It also selects work of women artists influenced by Surrealism, such as Frida Kahlo, Remedios Varo and Claude Cahun. The background to the representation of the female body in a dominantly male culture is researched through historical analysis, revealing womans unique psychic state and knowledge. The anatomists such as Andreas Vesalius, Bernhard Siegfried Albinus, and William Hunter explored human bodies to know the intricate structures underneath skin. Death-related photography from the mid nineteenth century to the twentieth century revealed the unfathomable nature of human existence in documentary images that extended scientific and psychological approaches to the body. My creative work has a focus on the imagery that evokes the message of decay, solitude, and metamorphosis. Ruminating about such imagery and creative process is an attempt to express artistically how human self-affirmation can be achieved, and how I can gain an identity of the solitude of self through my imaginative photography, tableaux and assemblage.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV counselling, mental health and psychosocial care in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Casey, Kathleen Barbara</field><field name="description">Rationale: International research has demonstrated that in order to retain a skilled and healthy cadre of willing health-workers there is a need to monitor and develop strategies to mitigate adverse impact of this work and improve the quality and effectiveness of client and patient mental health care.  Aims: (i) Monitor and evaluate Thailand&#8217;s national HIV mental health and psychosocial care program. (ii) Measure the impact of HIV mental and psychological care on health care providers. (iii) Examine the relationship between occupation-related psychological morbidity and the recruitment, training, clinical supervision and work-practices of HIV mental health service providers. (iv) Develop, implement and evaluate a training curriculum that addresses the demands of the HIV client population in Thailand.  Method: In Study 1, 826 government hospitals, 1000 government health centres, and 1135 non-government organisations and private providers participated in: semi-structured, key informant interviews; focussed group discussions; and criterion-referenced appraisals of health policy and service delivery.  Study 2, a small exploratory, qualitative study, utilised a schema of five key stressors commonly associated with HIV care to analyse responses gained from HIV counsellors and employed semi-structured interviews and focussed discussion groups. Study 3, a cross-sectional study, explored the relationship between training, work practices, Locus of Control of Behaviour and the self-reporting of signs and symptoms of psychological distress. 803 HIV counsellors completed a series of questionnaires including the Thai version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the Locus of Control of Behaviour Questionnaire and the Thai HIV Counsellors Survey (THCS).  Study 4 involved the development, delivery and evaluation of a series of short courses designed to train 79 health workers to provide HIV counselling.  The training was evaluated by pre and post knowledge examinations and anonymous evaluations.  Results: Study 1 found that policy and legislation failed to adequately guide the practitioner in a number of key areas including: testing and counselling of minors; testing without informed consent; confidentiality of medical records and disclosure of HIV status; and &#8220;duty of care&#8221; in terms of threatened suicide or harm to others.  Furthermore, it was found that epidemiological data had not been adequately considered in terms of providing specific psychological support services, and developing counselling curriculum, and that the conduct of Thai based psychological and operations research had been limited. Whilst there was good national coverage of HIV testing counselling services, psychological services to address HIV issues across the disease continuum were limited and frequently provided by individuals without adequate training.  There does not appear to be any systematic mechanism for monitoring and evaluating HIV mental health and psychosocial care.  This study also revealed that Thailand is limited in its ability to provide adequate HIV field-experienced, trained mental health care personnel who can teach in the necessary languages that would enable sharing of the Thai health sector experience within the region.  Study 2: The respondents identified a number of workplace stressors including: fear of contagion; client-professional boundary issues; difficulties with being identified as working in the sphere of a highly stigmatised disease; the experience of multiple losses, in a context of perceived inadequate training; role expansion; and perceived lack of recognition and reward.  Participants also identified a number of work and socio-cultural influences which were perceived to mitigate the impact of the work.  Study 3: Failure to take up counselling duties after training was primarily associated with counsellors having too many competing non-counselling duties (31.2%; n=108), and being deployed to other workplaces in a non-counselling capacity (22.8%,n=79).  Over 81% (n=441) of respondents who indicated that they were continuing to work as counsellors reported signs and symptoms of psychological disturbance on the GHQ-28 screening at a level that warranted further mental health assessment. There was a significant positive correlation between GHQ-28 &#8220;caseness&#8221; and Locus of Control of Behaviour scores (r =.118; p&lt;.001).  Decisions to leave counselling were positively associated with self reported psychological disturbance (r =.324; p&lt;.001) and the perception that their work was not helpful to clients (r =.108; p&lt;.001).  Study 4:  The results clearly showed that the curriculum, and method of training resulted in both perceived and measured change in knowledge and skills and were reported to have resulted in improvements in the trainees&#8217; perceived self confidence to meet the demands of their clients.  Conclusion: The studies identified the many challenges inherent in providing effective HIV counselling, mental health and psychosocial services in Thailand.  This research suggests that delivering HIV psychosocial care services in Thailand has potentially an adverse impact on: the health and well being of care providers; the quality of care received by clients and patients; and ultimately on the ability of the health system to retain its skilled personnel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interviewer effects in household surveys: estimation and design</field><field name="creator">Von Sanden, Nicholas Darby</field><field name="description">Although interviewers play an important role in the collection of high quality data, the presence of the interviewer may result in an unintended correlation between responses in surveys. The interviewer effect can greatly increase the variance of results derived from surveys and is not considered in standard variance estimates. The impact of interviewers on total survey error should be estimated so that survey data can be interpreted appropriately. Previous studies examining the interviewer effect have generally relied on fully interpenetrated designs, in which a minimum of two interviewers are randomly allocated to each spatial area. Interpenetration provides repeated measurement of spatial areas which allows spatial and interviewer effects to be disentangled. However, conducting an interpenetrated survey is an expensive process that is not often applied in practice. This thesis presents a review of techniques for estimating the interviewer component of total survey error and establishes a general framework for examining the interviewer effect in household surveys. The framework is applied to explicitly consider the relationship between the survey design and estimation of the interviewer effect for the first time. We demonstrate how the interviewer effect can be estimated in a variety of new scenarios, including designs in which the interviewer and spatial effects were previously considered confounded. We then consider the potential gain from incorporating the longitudinal and spatial information available to the survey designer. The concept of partial interpenetration is introduced and clearly defined. Methods for estimating the interviewer effect in partially interpenetrated surveys are then considered. Partially interpenetrated survey designs will now allow us to estimate the interviewer effect and its contribution to total survey error more efficiently and cost-effectively as a regular part of the survey process. Procedures for preparing cost-optimal partially interpenetrated survey designs for the estimation of the interviewer effect are introduced and the gains from estimating the interviewer effect in partially interpenetrated surveys quantified. Regular estimation of the interviewer effect will result in higher quality surveys and will have positive implications for ongoing monitoring leading to more appropriate interviewer training, questionnaire design and cost-effective surveys.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the design of turbo codes with convolutional interleavers</field><field name="creator">Vafi, Sina</field><field name="description">Random interleavers are amongst the most effective interleavers for turbo codes. However, due to their random permutations, a compact representation of the code specification is a major obstacle. Thus, to date, much research has been conducted on the design of deterministic interleavers having performances close to random interleavers. These interleavers are mainly constructed as block interleavers, which allows the code to be analyzed as a block code. In contrast to block interleavers, there are non-block interleavers. These utilize a reduced number of memories in their structures and have self-synchronization with their deinterleavers; this simplifies their design. Because of their non-block structures, turbo codes constructed by these interleavers must usually be analyzed in terms of the continuous performance. Previous research confirms that the codes&#65533; continuous performance is similar to their block performance, but at the expense of increased complexity of the code analysis and decoding. In order to analyze a turbo code constructed with non-block interleavers as a block code, it is necessary to consider the applied interleavers as block interleavers. This is accomplished by the insertion of stuff bits at the end of each input data block, returning the interleaver memories to zero state. This thesis is related to the application of convolutional interleavers which are the most popular non-block interleavers for turbo codes. It introduces convolutional interleavers as good deterministic interleavers that can perform similar or even better than previous deterministic and random interleavers. The thesis presents two different structures of block-wise convolutional interleavers, created on the basis of distribution of stuff bits in the interleaved data. On the basis of convolutional interleaver properties, a simple algorithm is introduced to analyze code performance at different signal to noise ratios. The code analysis is confirmed with simulation results, which allow selection of the most suitable interleaver. Different models of the selected convolutional interleavers are verified. These models are constructed based on changing the period and space values, which are introduced as the constituent parameters of convolutional interleavers. The performance of interleavers with different periods and a space value 1 are investigated. For a similar number of stuff bits, these interleavers are compared with interleavers constructed with shorter periods and highest fixed space values than 1. Convolutional interleavers with variable space values operating as generalized convolutional interleavers are also presented and their performance is compared with interleavers using the fixed space value. Turbo codes constituted with the mentioned interleavers are analyzed using different input bitstreams. Based on the analysis, suitable modifications are proposed for each model of interleaver so as to improve the turbo code performance through a reduced number of stuff bits. The performance of the modified convolutional interleavers is compared with good deterministic and random block interleavers. The results demonstrate that with an acceptable number of stuff bits contributed to each interleaved data, convolutional interleavers provide similar or improved performance when compared to block interleavers. Finally, the application of designed convolutional interleavers in Unequal Error Protection (UEP) turbo codes is presented. Based on the code specifications and interleaver properties, three different techniques for UEP are suggested to improve protection of priority data, while reducing the overall number of stuff bits inserted into the interleaver memories.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of environmental disclosures made by Chinese mineral extraction corporations</field><field name="creator">Lu, Ying Jun</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates environmental disclosure practices of the mineral extraction industry in China by analyzing annual reports of companies listed on both ShangHai Stock Exchange and ShenZhen Stock Exchange.The population of this study is all listed firms classified into mineral extraction industry by both ShangHai and ShenZhen stock exchanges over a three year period from 2005 to 2007, yielding a sample of 80 usable observations.

Moreover, contrary to the accepted, conventional, but untheorised practice of coeducational classrooms. This study demonstrates that the single-gendered primary school class does have the potential to provide a unique learning environment. The teachers in this study encouraged confidence building and social cohesiveness as essential, foundational attributes of the learning group. When the teachers became aware of the potential for single-gendered classes to develop as internally cooperative groups, they designed a pedagogy that was highly relevant to each gender. It achieved these attributes because it was high in motivational potential and conducive of social harmony. Thus these findings provide important information for current teachers and a new direction for the pre-service education of teachers. The research literature demonstrated that the most accurate indicators of diminished literacy achievement at primary school exit points in Australia were low socio-economic status, masculinity and rurality. Furthermore, these issues were identified in many studies as being problematic, long-standing correlates, and there was little evidence in the literature of productive school initiatives specifically directed to overcoming such problems. However, the literature did provide answers explaining why single-gendered classes might be productive, suggesting that classroom teachers have the potential to influence children more significantly than might their home environments. Furthermore, some evidence was found that when children were separated according to gender, during their middle years of schooling, they could be given specific instruction that would serve to assist them later in their education. A combination of these ideas offered a way of understanding the positive interactions that were occurring as a result of the new initiative, the single gendered classroom in a coeducational school. I found two schools where single-gendered classes had been established within state-run coeducational primary schools. The research was a case study, with an initial focus on understanding the process of teaching writing in four, single-gendered classrooms in low socio-economic state primary schools. As the study progressed, my attention became increasingly drawn to the problem of understanding the very positive social and educational dynamics of the single-gendered groups, and the general literacy pedagogy that began to emerge in each of the classrooms. Those aspects of the research became the primary concerns of this study. Data were derived from my ongoing conversations, tape-recorded interviews with the teachers, field-notes of weekly classroom observations, and teachers and students completed questionnaires. The discourse of interviews was linguistically analysed and recreated to form narrative accounts of my interactions with teachers. The teachers stories not only demonstrated their satisfaction with the results of the single-gendered classes, but also revealed their mixed understandings of the reasons that might explain the success of the venture. The teachers accounts provided valuable insights that contributed to the development of a grounded theory that explains why the organisation of primary school children into single-gendered classes has the potential to create highly productive learning settings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human behavioural skills modelling and recognition</field><field name="creator">Sun, Chao</field><field name="description">Human behaviour can be considered as the ensemble of various activities performed by an individual towards performing a particular task. There are many factors influencing human behaviour including culture, attitudes, emotions, values, ethics, and so on. In this work, the concept of 'human behaviour' in the context of human psycho-motor behaviour is studied. This work is primarily concerned with the development of a system to learn, distinguish and recognise various pre-defined human behavioural tasks. As an initial constraint, the challenging goal, subject to the limitation of hardware, is to model various human behaviours with only one integrated inertial sensor. The motions are captured with the sensor and recorded as streams of multi-dimensional sensory data, which are subsequently analysed into certain patterns. Since only one point on the human body can be measured with that sensor at a time, there are not sufficient motion data to enable the generation of new synthetic behaviours (which might be possible with multiple sensors). It is not really possible to develop a comprehensive model of complex behaviours under this condition. Thus, this work has focussed on building a system to model the behaviour of a specific part of the human body, and in turn to recognise and compare these behaviours. The experimental rig consists of an inertial sensor mounted on the subject providing kinematics data in real-time. Through this sensor, the behavioural motions are transformed into continuous streams of signals including Euler angles and accelerations in three spatial dimensions. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms and other techniques are implemented to analyse and build models of human behaviours in this work. An intrinsic classification algorithm called MML (Minimum Message Length encoding), and a popular unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM (Fuzzy c-Means) are used to segment the complex data streams respectively, formulating inherent models of the dynamic modes they represent. Subsequent representation and analysis including FSM (Finite State Machines), DTW (Dynamic Time Warping), Kullback-Leibler divergence and Smith-Waterman sequence alignment have proved quite effective in distinguishing between behavioural characteristics that persist across a variety of tasks and multiple candidates. The hypothesis pursued in the thesis has been validated based on two machine learning algorithms for unsupervised learning namely MML and FCM. Each of these methods is capable of producing a range of primitives from the motion training data. However, the outcomes of regular expression and Dynamic Time Warping analysis results indicate that MML provides better results compared with the FCM algorithm in terms of identifying behaviours.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheduling in packet switches with relaxed constraint</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Lixiang</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I present a series of new scheduling algorithms for an ATM-like crossbar input-queued switching fabric of an IP router.

Such forces (Hammer and Champy, 1993, pp. 17) are related to organisational survival factors such as market share and price premiums, cost reductions, quicker response to new market demands, quicker response to competitor practices, operating equipment effectiveness, cycle time reductions and reductions to inefficiencies and material requirements. As a result, manufacturing organisations now have an increased focus on specific competitive advantages, geographic spread and location, management of costs, relations with customers and suppliers and by no means least, the treatment and development of people (Porter, 1990, pp. 40~41). As well, in some industries more than others, there has been a progressive change in focus away for separate, arms-length entities along a common supply chain to a more integrated and collaborative view. (Christopher, 1998, pp. 5). Supply Chain Management (SCM) as such, is by now recognised by many organisations as a means by which they can gain competitive advantage and improve their business results (Spekman et al., 1998, pp. 630). Effective SCM therefore can become a strategic factor in a firm's success (Cohen and Roussel, 2005, pp. 9). This is particularly the case as more companies link their advantages together and start to operate as supply networks of interdependent supply chain partners as opposed to separate, stand-alone entities (Spekman et al., 1998, pp. 632). Associated with such an approach is the integration of intra and inter-businesses processes in order to achieve such business-to-business linkage. As illustrated by companies such as Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart, Shell Chemical and Georgia-Pacific Corp, an effective supply chain network can competitively outperform the standalone model (Lummus and Alber, 1997, pp. 10, Cohen and Roussel, 2005, pp. 10). This superior performance manifests itself as performance advantages on a number of key supply chain performance measures (Shin et al., 2000, pp. 330). Consistent with the theme of supply chain management, this research deals specifically with the order fulfilment processes operating within a supply chain and in particular the integration of those processes both horizontally and vertically within the chain. The key belief is that higher levels of such integration will assist organisations to improve their supply chain and overall business performance. The major objective of this work therefore was to answer the question: 'How much and in what ways does the integration of supply chain logistics processes in manufacturing organisations impact upon business performance?' The methodology used to address the above research question consisted firstly of conducting an exhaustive literature review. From that review, the main research hypotheses and three theoretical frameworks were proposed. The hypotheses and theoretical frameworks captured the ideas and findings of numerous researchers and writers with respect to variables and relationship structures that may help answer the research question. The main research hypotheses developed and tested therefore were as follows: H1: That the integration of supply chain logistics processes does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. H2: That the application of supply chain management principles does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. H3: That the application of human 'social' principles/approaches does significantly and positively impact supply chain and business performance. Following the literature review, a survey instrument was designed and tested, contact details of target participants were obtained and finally the sequence of questionnaire related letters (including the questionnaire) was mailed out. Responses were assessed for suitability (completeness and reasonableness), entered into Excel and later imported into SPSS ver. 13.0 for analysis. 210 usable responses were obtained from 230 returned questionnaires sent to 1050 supply chain professionals in 990 companies worldwide. The results of the data analysis (principally via the use of structural equation modelling) showed conditional support for each of the research hypotheses and good support for the first of the proposed theoretical frameworks. Because of this, a simulation model of the first theoretical framework was developed such that the research results can: (a) be seen visually and in a dynamic way, (b) be used by others to test their mental models of supply chain 'DNA' against and to improve the robustness of their supply chain improvement plans and initiatives and (c) be used by educators to demonstrate dynamically the relationships between supply chain lever and outcome variables. The second and third theoretical frameworks proposed were not supported. Factor analysis was undertaken in order to reduce highly related variables to fewer underlying constructs. The factor analysis confirmed that such data-reduction was possible for the study's chosen variables such that the 10 dependent variables could be reduced to 5 variates and the study's 32 independent variables could be reduced to 8 variates. The research conclusions are described including identification of conditional support for the three above hypotheses, confirmation of the best-fit theoretical model and affirmation that integration of supply chain logistics processes does positively influence both supply chain and business outcomes.

Traditionally, heat stress equations have been used to identify scenarios likely to cause heat illness, based on the environmental conditions, and estimates of workload. However, as individuals respond differently to the same heat stress, it is often considered more appropriate to directly measure physiological responses (strain) so that behavioural changes may be used to reduce thermal strain. This project aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the development of a personal heat strain monitor, by evaluating a suitable surrogate index of core temperature for use in a working environment.This index was an insulated skin temperature (Tskin-insul), located laterally to the T2-T4 spine. Using linear regression modelling, we have found this Tskin-insul to closely approximate changes in oesophageal temperature (Tes). In this research, we applied these regression model to pre-existing data from our laboratory, resulting in 83% of the variance in Tes being explained on the basis of Tskin-insul, with a standard error of the estimate of 0.15&#176;C on individual trials. With multiple-linear regression analyses using physiological and psychophysical measures as potential predictor variables, the standard error of the estimate fell to 0.10&#176;C. Due to variation in the intercept and slope values, no single prediction equation was able to be derived for all situations, and this technique was considered impractical for use in a commercial monitor.By combining data collected at the same air temperature, four sets of equations were developed for each of three ambient temperature ranges. The predictor variables in these equations were: (i) Tskin-insul only (simple linear regression modelling); (ii) Tskin-insul and heart rate; (iii) Tskin-insul, heart rate, mass and sum of six skinfolds; and (iv) perceived exertion, Tskin-insul, mass and sum of six skinfolds. It was possible to predict Tes to an acceptable accuracy (standard error of estimate &lt;0.2&#176;C) using Tskin-insul, heart rate, body mass and sum of skinfolds in a multiple linear regression analysis.When these equations were trialed on independent datasets (air temperature $30&#176;C), all the equations developed for use in air temperatures of 30-36&#176;C resulted in the standard error of the estimate being &gt;0.2&#176;C. The equations developed on data collected at 40&#176;C had a similarly high error, with the most accurate equation, which utilised only Tskin-insul as a predictor variable, having a standard error of the estimate of 0.05&#176;C above the maximum recommended level. The prediction equations utilising additional variables recorded standard error of the estimate values exceeding twice the recommended maximum level.These prediction equations were examined in relation to their efficacy for use with industrial heat strain guidelines. The equations developed using Tskin-insul, heart rate, mass and sum of six skinfolds were the most accurate equations at measuring a 0.8&#176;C and 1.0&#176;C change in Tes, at air temperatures of 30&#176;C and 40&#176;C. The prediction of an Tes measurement of 38.0&#176;C and 38.5&#176;C revealed that equations using Tskin-insul as the only predictor variable were most accurate. The equations for use at an air temperature of 36-40&#176;C were considered sufficiently accurate for use in a personal monitoring system, with those developed for 30-36&#176;C deemed to be unsuitable in the present form.The prediction equations were trialed in two heat strain indices: the Physiological Strain Index and the Cumulative Heat Strain Index. The predicted Tes measurement was inserted into these indices. It was found that the prediction equations using Tskininsul as the only predictor variable in the Physiological Strain Index, created a result that could be considered desirable in the air temperature range of 30-40&#176;C. It was determined that, due to the level of inaccuracy of the equations, it was not possible to use surrogate measures of Tes in the Cumulative Heat Strain Index. Future research should primarily focus on reducing Tskin-insul measurement error, with the measurement then being trialed across a broad range of conditions to examine its efficacy for use in a personal monitoring system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative ecology of rare and common species in a fire-prone system</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Mark K.J.</field><field name="description">Due to escalating rates of extinction around the world, it is important to focus research and management on those species most at risk. Factors such as climate change and human population growth are also placing increasing pressure on species that are currently more common and widespread. Understanding the ecology of common species as well as those species that are already threatened is therefore central to conservation biology. In particular, studies targeting species for which little or nothing is currently known can increase our general ecological knowledge and also help to identify species with critical life history traits that could be limiting under future environmental scenarios. The Ericaceae family in Australia (formerly Epacridaceae) is an example of one such group of species. Our current understanding of the ecology of the Ericaceae in this region is poor, even though species within this family make up a significant proportion of the understorey in temperate, fire-prone plant communities. To address this gap in our knowledge, I selected several obligate-seeding shrub species within the genus Leucopogon (Ericaceae) as the focus for this study in south-eastern Australia. Obligate-seeding species such as these, with soil-stored seed banks, have been the subject of far fewer studies than their counterparts that resprout or have canopy-stored seed banks. I used a demographic approach, aimed at providing fundamental ecological data for a rare species, Leucopogon exolasius, and some common and more widespread congeneric taxa, in order to explore processes that potentially limit their relative abundance. Plants of obligate-seeding species are killed by fire, so persistence of populations is dependent primarily on regeneration from stored seed. Fundamental to understanding any aspect of seed ecology is being able to determine whether a seed is viable and dormant or inviable. Taking this primary step in this study was complicated by the fact that the adequacy of the most common method used for checking seed viability, the tetrazolium test, is hard to assess for difficult to germinate species such as Leucopogon, and there are no data assessing its applicability for most Australian species. I therefore compared the results of the tetrazolium test with a simple cut test. When estimating the proportion of viable seeds, a strong correlation was found between the two methods for the three species of Leucopogon used (r &gt; 0.9). The cut test and tetrazolium test both also produced good estimates of viability of seed lots when compared to germination potential of non-dormant seeds retrieved from burial. The results not only supported the use of the less laborious cut test as a reliable method for estimating seed viability throughout this study, but also provided information to assist the accuracy and applicability of the tetrazolium method, previously unavailable for this group of native Australian species. Dormancy-breaking cues for species within the genus Leucopogon are poorly understood and appear to be complex, with laboratory studies often resulting in little or no germination. Due to the difficulties experienced in germinating Leucopogon in other studies, I initially established dormancy class in order to identify the mechanisms responsible for controlling dormancy of the three study species. Assessment of seed morphology and preliminary laboratory germination experiments led me to classify the primary dormancy of L. exolasius, L. setiger and L. esquamatus as morphophysiological. Further germination trials revealed that seasonal temperatures overcame primary dormancy and controlled the timing of germination, as has been found for other species with a physiological dormancy component. Despite the fact that the study species display a flush of post-fire seedling emergence in the field, fire cues did not break primary dormancy. Once seasonal temperatures overcame primary dormancy, however, there was a trend for smoke to enhance germination. Knowing if fire is responsible for breaking dormancy, or whether it simply enhances levels of post-fire germination for seeds in which dormancy has been overcome by other factors, is important for a greater understanding of plant population dynamics. Dormancy had not previously been classified for any species from this fire-prone region, and it was unknown whether physiological dormancy was a common trait, or perhaps a potential cause of rarity. It was also unknown whether a lack of response by Leucopogon seeds to fire cues was particular to these species, or a consequence of physiological dormancy mechanisms generally. To investigate this, I estimated the relative proportions of dormancy types for shrub species which occurred in fire-prone habitats in south-eastern Australia. I also assessed the literature for evidence of the effects of fire cues on species with a physiological dormancy component. Representatives of all dormancy classes were found to occur in the region, in proportions similar to that estimated for other fire-prone regions around the world. Over 50% of shrub species had a physiological dormancy component, whilst over 40% had physical dormancy. Additionally, when the assessment was confined to threatened species, the relative proportion of physiologically dormant species represented increased, indicating that dormancy type plays a role in determining rarity. Seasonal temperatures, not fire cues, were the main factors that broke physiologically related dormancy mechanisms. Physiological factors, and therefore seasonal temperatures, are likely to be important in controlling the dormancy and patterns of post-fire germination of many species in fire-prone regions.Obligate-seeding species are dependent on recruitment from the seed bank for populations to recover after fire. Longevity of seeds stored in the soil is therefore a particularly critical life history trait of the study species. Two points were addressed in this part of the study. Firstly, I estimated the relative seed bank longevities of the L. exolasius, L. setiger and L. esquamatus. A short-lived seed bank in relation to typical fire return intervals for the region would indicate this as a cause of species rarity. Secondly, I wanted to determine whether primary dormancy was required for seed bank persistence, and whether the distinction between dormancy and persistence affects our understanding of seed bank dynamics in fire-prone regions. Using in situ seed burial trials, I found that all three species had persistent seed banks, with estimated halflives between 3.5 and 5.5 years. Laboratory germination trials and embryo measurements of retrieved seeds showed that primary dormancy was broken during the first year of burial, and I concluded that specific requirements were therefore needed for germination. These results supported the findings from the previous germination Chapter, and supported the conclusion that fire cues that are observed to promote germination in situ are not necessarily the ones that break dormancy. Most studies in fire-prone regions have failed to distinguish between these two factors, with attention subsequently diverted away from mechanisms actually controlling dormancy and seed bank dynamics.Realising the potential importance of seasonal germination cues highlighted by previous Chapters, I formulated the hypothesis that seasonal emergence patterns are more likely for species with a physiological dormancy component than their physically dormant counterparts. In regions like south-eastern Australia, which has no distinct rainfall season, seasonal germination could delay post-fire seedling emergence, and subsequently hinder recruitment, depending on the timing of the fire event. I therefore assessed the impact of seasonally delayed emergence and fire season on recruitment success of the three study species, and ascertained how vulnerable they are to changes to fire season. Post-fire seedling survival and growth were measured after the same fire event, comparing the physiologically dormant Leucopogon species (displaying seasonal emergence) with physically dormant or &#8220;hard-seeded&#8221; species (displaying season-independent emergence). I found that Leucopogon emergence was delayed compared to physically dormant species and, as a consequence, both survival and growth were significantly reduced. Intra-specific comparisons of Leucopogon species after winter and summer fires, indicated that seasonal germination requirements delayed seedling emergence by 12 months after winter fires, in relation to other co-occurring species, and by 3 to 6 months after summer fires. Seedlings emerging after summer fires grew and matured more quickly than those emerging after winter fires. Because species with physically dormant seeds have quick emergence tied closely to fire, whereas the speed of emergence of physiologically dormant species is dependent on fire season, I concluded that fire might not have been the primary force selecting for physiologically dormant species. Season of fire could strongly influence the persistence of the study species, and other seasonally emerging species. The final aim of this study was to assess any potential causes of rarity In addition to the fundamental ecological data already collected for several key life history traits, data on fecundity, dispersal mechanisms and seedling survival and growth were also analysed and used in a comparative assessment, to establish whether there were any plausible causes of rarity of L. exolasius. Compared to the two common congeners, L. setiger and L. esquamatus, as well as to other obligate-seeding species in the region, L. exolasius had a markedly longer primary juvenile period. This raises the likelihood that short inter-fire intervals cause local extinction of populations of this species by killing plants prior to maturation and seed bank replenishment. Seasonal emergence, identified during the analyses of physiological dormancy mechanisms, also had the potential to increase the length of the maturation period. Local extinction of the Emu, a large bird and primary long distance dispersal mechanism for fleshy-fruited species, may have limited opportunities for range expansion and recolonisation. The investigation of critical life history stages during this study has led to the conclusion that L. exolasius persistence appears to be bound to fire frequency. More surprising, however, is the finding that fire season could potentially influence persistence considerably, not only of L. exolasius, but of a large proportion of species with physiological dormancy that occur in fireprone regions. Consequently, the ability of L. exolasius, and many other species, to persist in the future would be compromised by changes to the fire regime. The impacts of implemented fires and the effects of climate change are both forecast to promote higher fire frequency and cause changes to peak fire season. These changes could represent significant threats to L. exolasius populations, as well as to many other obligate-seeding species in the region with long primary juvenile periods and physiological dormancy. Further research into the effects of seasonal dormancy and germination requirements, particularly in relation to fire season, could help to gain a greater understanding of plant population dynamics and persistence in fire-prone regions. A greater understanding of dormancy mechanisms generally in fire-prone regions could also shed further light onto questions such as the evolution of species in relation to fire.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bush fire patchiness</field><field name="creator">Heemstra, Simon</field><field name="description">All bush fires are patchy at some scale and to some degree. In their most obvious form, bush fire patches are unburnt islands of vegetation within a fire boundary. Bush fire patchiness is an important part of the fire regime, because it can affect ecological processes such as local extinction and recolonisation and can contribute to the post-fire resilience of populations of animals that need vegetation cover. During a fire, the survival of plants and animals can often depend on the degree of patchiness. Unburnt patches may therefore affect the post-fire dynamics of plant and animal populations. Continuity of fuel loads is a major contributor to bush fire behaviour including the intensity and rate spread of the fire. Further, the degree of patchiness is one measure of the effectiveness of a hazard-reduction fire in reducing fuel and thus modifying subsequent wildfire behaviour. An understanding of the patchiness of fires is of critical importance for landscape bush fire risk management. Quantifying patchiness is no simple task, partly because of the continuous range of scales at which patchiness occurs and partly because patches cannot always be readily detected by remote sensing techniques, especially in forested systems in which canopy scorch is not closely aligned with burning of the understorey. Moreover, remotely sensed data are expensive at the fine resolution required to detect the small scale patterns that are ecologically relevant (i.e. of the order of metres). In such systems, a method of rapidly assessing patchiness in the field is much needed. The first aim of this study was to develop a field technique for the quantification of patchiness. The second aim was to determine the effectiveness of the technique in estimating overall patchiness in a site, using a simulation model based on a range of known patch sizes and distributions. The third was to use field estimation of patchiness to investigate the environmental parameters that influence the patchiness of fires. A range of methods was assessed and transect sampling the post bush fire landscape using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to produce a spatial model within a Geographic Information System (GIS) was found to be an accurate and simple method for assessing the patchiness of a fire. This method was time efficient and cost effective. It produced an output that provided a clear description of the overall patchiness of a site as well as the relative distribution of the sizes of the patches. The spatial model can display the distribution of proportion of areas burnt within the landscape. I tested the statistical effectiveness of this transect sampling method using spatial modelling within a GIS. I wrote a program to simulate thousands of transect samples on a range of different spatial arrangements of patches within a landscape. This simulation revealed that the minimum number of transects required to provide an estimate of the actual 'patchiness' is dependent on the type of fire and range between 5 and 10, to obtain 90% accuracy of the estimate of the patchiness. The empirical transect data from each site was used using GIS to develop a spatial model assessing the relative influences of a range of topographic and environmental variables on the patchiness of a fire. The relative influence of these variables was different for each fire. From this analysis, a map was produced from a GIS that described the spatial distribution of patchiness within a given fire. This transect data was graphed to indicate the relative distribution and abundance of unburnt patches. The studies performed indicate these methods have important applications for managing biodiversity and wildfires.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Giving games a day job: developing a digital game-based resource for journalism training</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David J</field><field name="description">Computer simulations have been commonplace in some industries such as the military, medicine and science and educators are now actively exploring their potential application to a range of disciplines.

This thesis comprises two parts: a) the written component which describes the production of the hypertext-based journalism training scenario and, b) a prototype copy of the training scenario on CD-ROM. The Flood scenario depicts the flooding of a fictional city called Lagoon, and is based on real news stories, media releases and audio-visual material gathered during major floods in the Central West of NSW in August 1990. In its present form Flood is designed as a multi-path learning narrative, which participants must pursue and unravel in their search for news stories. My intention has been to develop a more engaging activity than is currently the case for many traditional, paper-based, approaches to journalism training exercises. Flood is also specifically designed for flexible delivery via the Internet or CD-ROM. This approach makes it especially well suited for both on-campus and distance education students. The Flood resource is at this stage a limited prototype designed as a teaching aid. A theoretical framework combining the roles of researchers and producer is discussed in the thesis. An overview of the use of simulations in journalism education contextualises the practical project, and the place of Web-based scenario simulation within an emerging teaching framework digital game-based learning is considered. There is also an examination of historical precedents for the application of technology in Australian journalism classrooms. The Flood prototype has been trailed at Charles Sturt University with on-campus undergraduate students in 2001 and 2002, and with distance education postgraduate students in 2002. Descriptions of these trials, and details of the student feedback, are provided. This project also includes an experimental narrative element, the use of a software artificial intelligence character known as a chatterbox to explore possibilities for providing a more personal and engaging experience. One of the key design intentions of this project has been consideration of ways to allow participants to develop their own lines of questioning, rather than forcing them to simply follow pre-determined paths. The thesis concludes that digital materials such as the Flood package are worthy of future development to complement the face-to-face instruction in reporting tasks, internships and classroom simulations traditionally used in journalism education and training. Computer simulations are a means for providing students with a controlled exposure to the journalistic process. However, simulation and reality are clearly two different experiences, and digital game-based learning in its present form does not provide a complete substitute for journalism as it is practised in the workplace.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game of two halves: preparing young elite rugby players for a future beyond the game</field><field name="creator">Price, Nathan</field><field name="description">The rise to professionalisation in 1995, and the increasing globalisation of rugby has changed the way the sport is viewed and engaged in by talented young athletes. The shift to a more professional work environment, high salaries, and the increased opportunity for young men who, once they leave school, and sometimes before, to seek employment in this workforce, has altered the way young players look, think and behave. With the shift to professionalism, the situation for young elite rugby players has become critical. Many view rugby as a career option, sacrificing education and training in pursuit of lucrative contracts, unaware of the realities of the occupation in which a relatively high number of players &#8216;don&#8217;t make it&#8217;. Those young players who are unsuccessful in their pursuit of a rugby career are often left directionless with no education or training in an alternative occupation or profession. In elite sport, retirement can be extremely difficult to cope with if athletes are not adequately prepared, or have not planned for such an event. This lack of preparation can leave athletes vulnerable to the challenges of retirement. The need for knowledge in this study relates to how young elite rugby players make sense of rugby as work, how they understand themselves as athletes, and how they make sense of their opportunities for a life outside rugby. The opportunities, barriers and needs for career development, planning and education to prepare young athletes for a life outside elite rugby and the ways these young men negotiate their lives and their alternatives are largely unknown. This thesis examines the experiences of young men who are part of the first generation of players who will only experience rugby in its professional format, and provides them with a voice as they pursue work as professional rugby players. More specifically, this study explores issues such as rugby as an occupational choice for young men, how players perceive, and are subsequently prepared for, a life outside rugby, their identification with the sport, and their needs and concerns as elite young rugby players. To gain a further understanding of the resources and opportunities available to assist in the development of these young men and their preparation for a life outside rugby, the study also explores coaches&#8217; and managements&#8217; perspectives and the ways in which they approach these relatively new issues facing young athletes. Investigation in this area of young athletes&#8217; experience has been limited, with the majority of research v focusing on recently retired athletes, or those more established in their professional sport career, as opposed to those beginning to embark on, or pursuing a career in professional sport. There has been little research into the career experiences of elite young rugby players as a basis of understanding how best to prepare them for their future experiences both during, and post-elite athletic performance. The study employed a largely qualitative methodology, interviewing twenty-five young elite rugby players (18-22 years of age) in New Zealand and New South Wales, and eight coaching and management staff from rugby union and the wider sports industry. The use of semi-structured in-depth interviews enabled a rich understanding of the experiences of elite young rugby players from the perspectives of the players, coaches and management. A mixed mode approach was used to a limited extent, where additional quantitative data was collected through the use of a questionnaires provided to one group of participants. The main themes that emerged from this inquiry formed key considerations for the preparation of elite young rugby players in their future beyond rugby. These considerations highlighted the career development needs, barriers, opportunities and experiences of elite young rugby players as they pursued a career in professional rugby. Among others, the analysis of interviews identified an identity heavily invested in rugby, unrealistic predictions of their future rugby life cycle, the structure of the work, and support from their clubs and academies as key inhibitors to players career development and post-rugby planning. The study revealed that the involvement in elite rugby largely does not facilitate the accomplishment of developmental tasks that athletes require later in life. In many cases these young men are sacrificing the potential breadth of their future selves in the pursuit of a rugby career. Thus, the study points to the need for a greater focus in the support, assistance and resources for young elite rugby players in their career development and planning for their post-rugby future. These young men are in many cases at risk of having no tangible entry into an occupation or career should they not succeed in professional rugby.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial maintenance data collection and application: developing an information strategy for an industrial site</field><field name="creator">Evans, Roy F</field><field name="description">This work involved the evaluation of the efficacy of industrial information management. The study was prompted by the observation that contemporary society seemingly struggles to effectively utilise and manage the volumes of information that new technologies are delivering. It is reasonable to assume that industry, as a mirror of contemporary society, may be struggling to manage the convergence of equivalent information technologies. Traditionally, within industry, structured organisations of people use work processes to record plant history in computerised work management systems. This work employs a socio technical perspective to examine conflict that is likely to be occurring within such structured groups of people. Social (socio) in respect of participants&#8217; behavioural changes, technical in respect of understanding data selection for machine condition management.Field research used constructivist evaluation methodology in three phases. Evaluation of current information management practice, in three electricity-generating power stations, was followed by an ethnological study to determine why industrial information management developed in the way that it had. By way of comparison, a third field research phase evaluated financial and medical information management processes. At the evaluated sites, industrial information management was found to be an inadequately developed concept. Processes were found to be managed without application of explicitly stated strategies or audit protocols. Staff considered recording of work to be a transactional process directed at monitoring human performance rather than being a process for analysis to facilitate plant condition management and to develop plant knowledge.Conclusions based primarily upon the ethnographical study indicate that the effects of informal social influence, power conflict, scientific work process and job design all contribute to an imbalance that develops between explicit recording and the complementary development of a tacit knowledge base. In contrast, medical ward management employed a combination of socio technical principles and informal double loop analyses to address corresponding conflict.Outcomes of the study indicate that an evaluative matrix, developed for the study, would be suitable for professional audit of site information strategies and processes. Complementing the evaluative matrix has been the development of a practical methodology, based upon socio technical principles, which would be suitable for the development of convergent site information and production strategies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/92</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy</field><field name="creator">Yahia, Abdusalam F</field><field name="description">The Socialist People&#8217;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a small oil-producing developing economy in North Africa. Its economy depends heavily on oil revenue. Oil exports accounted for 92-97 percent of annual total Libyan exports and contributed 40-60 percent of annual GDP during the period 1963-2006. The Libyan economy, like other Middle Eastern oil producers, has been subject to several strong external shocks resulting from fluctuations in oil prices since September 1973. Economic conditions of the Libyan economy worsened in the 1990&#8217;s as a result of international sanctions. Since the ending of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been implementing measures to reform and open its economy. Libya needs strong and sustained economic growth to meet the demands of its rapidly growing labour force, which require high investment in physical and human capital and an efficient use of the country&#8217;s resources. However, the achievement of these objectives depends on oil prices. The aim of this thesis is to find out the impact of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy during the period of 1963-2004. The thesis tries to contribute to literature by examining the effects of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth; Libyan investment; the patterns of Libyan imports and trade relationship with its major trading partners. This thesis also attempts to assess the impact of fluctuation in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balance of payments. Many researchers devoted their time and skill in tackling problems related to trade and growth. However, the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing economies came to the interest of some researchers only recently and more precisely since the oil embargo in late 1973.  Despite the growing literature on the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing countries in the Middle East, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature.  In particular no attempt has been made to examine the impact of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy and in particular on Libyan economic growth, Libyan gross fixed capital formation, Libyan imports, the feedback effects in Libyan trade with its major importers and effects of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balances of payments. Sophisticated economic models and econometric techniques have been utilized in this thesis in order to achieve its objectives. These models and techniques include single equation models, simultaneous equations models, forecasting models and co-integration analysis. The fluctuations in oil prices had very important effects on the Libyan labor force, sectoral employment, Libyan social and development indicators, contribution of various economic activities, Libyan expenditure, Libyan composition of foreign trade and Libyan balance of payments. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth using the &#8220;export as an engine of growth model&#8221; and applying a &#8220;Koyck distributed lag scheme&#8221; suggest that there are spread effects from oil exports to the rest of the economy. However, when both the component and inflationary effects are excluded (but not the real gain from the rise in export prices) the results suggest no evidence of spread effects. This conclusion is supported by sectoral output analysis. The use of co-integration analysis to examine the long-term trade relationship between Libyan GDP and its oil exports suggest that there is no long-term relationship between Libyan oil exports and non-oil GDP. In other words, the two variables do drift too far apart from each other over time. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on investment in the Libyan economy was assessed using an accelerator model of investment to capture investment behavior in the Libyan economy. It was revealed that the Libyan capital formation is strongly influenced by spending on components of aggregate demand other than investment and the downturn in oil prices had a serious adverse effect on investment. There seems to be an existence of some bottlenecks Also, investment in the Libyan economy was mainly autonomous public investment in infrastructure. To find out if there is a long-term relationship between investment and other components of aggregate demand (private consumption + public consumption + net exports) in the Libyan economy, the co-integration technique was used. The long-run elasticity of investment expenditure in the Libyan economy, with respect to Libyan expenditure on other components of aggregate demand, was higher than the short-run elasticity during the period of boom of oil exports. However, there is no evidence of long-term relationships between investment and other components of aggregate demand in the Libyan economy. The analyses of the trade relationship between Libya and its major trading partners, using a simultaneous-equations model, suggest that an increase in Libyan&#8217;s exports to a major trading partner contributes to growth in Libyan GDP. The increase in Libyan income expands its imports from its major trading partners. This in turn contributed to growth in the income of the trade partners. The level of Libyan imports from its major trading partners does not seem to have any significant effect on the level of the GDP of its major trading partners except Greece, Turkey and Tunisia. The relationship between imports of various commodity groups and per capita income in the Libyan economy during variety periods of fluctuation in oil prices were evaluated using two-digit SIT classifications and five forms of import income function. It has been indicated that the reduction in oil revenue during the period of low oil prices has completely upset the import-income relationship, which was developed during the boom years, while the rise in oil revenue has recreated an improvement in the relationship. Single and simultaneous-equations models are developed and tested to examine the impact of the external and internal forces on Libyan balance of payments. The results are used in forecasting the future behavior of this balance under various scenarios. The analysis indicates that the ratio of trade balance to GDP has fluctuated sharply with changes in the world price of oil.  The decline in oil exports combined with deficit in the services balance and net current transfers depleted the gains from trade surplus in the Libyan economy.  This resulted in a continuous decline in the current account surplus.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/95</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of nanostructured electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Park, Min Sik</field><field name="description">State-of-the-art rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology has now paved the way for advanced energy storage systems to take their place in a variety of portable electronics. High cell voltage, good cycle life, and an attractive combination of energy and power generation are on the verge of being guaranteed for high-power and large-scale applications, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles. This investigation examines the circumstances attending the development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery, to seek a better understanding of the factors affecting its electrochemical performance. The major objective of this work is to determine the advantages and drawbacks of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanostructured materials as alternative anode materials and to suggest promising structural modifications in order to improve their electrochemical properties. Another important objective is to identify the correlation between electrochemical performance and particle size minimization in the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) system, a promising cathode material, and to give further evidence supporting the incomplete room-temperature reaction mechanism. The selection and assembly of nanostructured materials have been considered as central issues in the development of alternative anode materials that possess higher capacity and better cyclic retention compared to commercial graphite. SnO2 has shown high capacity and a relatively low reaction potential with Li+, and is thus under consideration as a possible candidate for high-power and high-energy applications. We have synthesized various types of SnO2 nanostructured materials, such as nanopowders, nanowires, and nanotubes in this work, and their electrochemical properties have been carefully compared in order to demonstrate the effects of their morphological differences on the electrochemical performance, based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. By incorporating structural modifications into the SnO2 nanostructured materials, we have formed Carbon encapsulated SnO2 nanopowders and nanowires by simple decomposition of malic acid (C4H6O5) at low temperature, which effectively improved specific capacity and cyclic performance. Combining surfactant mediated synthesis and the sol&#8211;gel vacuum suction method, SnO2&#8211;mesoporous organo-silica nano-array (MOSN) nanocomposites were prepared for controlling the large volume variation of SnO2 during cycling, where the MOSN could act as a mechanical buffer, resulting in a strong enhancement of cyclic retention.On the other hand, the reaction mechanism and phase transition of LiFePO4 at room temperature have not been fully understood yet. In pursuit of extending our understanding, we have prepared LiFePO4/C nanocomposites with different particle sizes and characterized their fundamental crystal structure, which is directly related to the electrochemical behavior. Considering the fact that the room temperature phase diagram is essential to understand the facile electrode reaction of LixFePO4 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1), here, we have suggested experimental evidence for isolation of an intermediate solid solution phase at around x = 0.93 at room temperature, which strongly supports the incomplete miscibility gap model. More interestingly, the impacts of air exposure on the LiFePO4/C nanocomposites have been systematically investigated as a function of temperature. We found that Li+ could be spontaneously extracted from the host structure, even at room temperature under air atmosphere. This finding also can explain the room temperature phase transition of LiFePO4 and provide the reason for the undesirable Li+ loss that is induced by external factors at room temperature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and pre-processing of signals observed in optical feedback self-mixing interferometry</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xiaojun</field><field name="description">Since the laser technlology has been applied for providing highly precise measurement, laser interferometry based systems have found increasing applications in the distance, displace measurement and related applications. Recently, a simple construction of laser interferometer with the use of so-called optical feedback self-mixing interferometry (OFSMI) effect has become a popular technique in optical measurement field. In comparison with conventional interferometer, OFSMI enables simple, compact size and cheap interferometer devices to be implemented.This thesis studies the spectrum characteristics of OFSMI signals and outlines novel approaches to analysze and process the noisy signal at the time and frequency domain simultaneously. The work is motivated by the observation that, when OFSMI signal is  given at weak feedback regime (feedback parameter C _ 1), the signal is strictly bandlimited, consequently an linear band-pass filter can be applied to remove the noise disturbance while preserving the signals waveform unchanged. On the other hand, in case of OFSMI signal is obtained with C &gt; 1, an efficient denoising algorithm based on joint time-frequency representation (TFR) can be applied. It has been found that TFR approach provides an sufficient prospective for study the behavior of OFSMI signals for C &gt; 1.This work contributes to the framework of pre-processing and analyzing of OFMSI signals. This thesis focus on the spectrum characteristics and the noise attenuation at weak and moderate feedback regime. To achieve this, the ability of band-pass FIR filters and TFR methods in OFSMI signal processing have been evaluated and compared. The results of this work lead to an significant improvement to the performance of OFSMI based laser measurement system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of two respiratory monitoring systems used for 4D CT and respiratory gating</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Joanne</field><field name="description">Respiratory gating enables breathing synchronised activation of CT image acquisition and linear accelerator radiation output.  Two commercially available respiratory gating systems used for planning and treatment of thoracic and abdominal cancer are investigated. The strain gauged AZ-733V respiratory gating system (Anzai Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was used concurrently with the infrared Real-time Position Management system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) to measure the respiratory cycle of 15 volunteers. Correlation between systems was measured in six locations and the optimum position of the external surrogates determined based on signal amplitude, reproducibility of breathing waveforms and the coefficient of determination between Anzai and RPM signals. The mean value of R2 between the two systems was found to be 0.611, 0.788 and 0.925 when both markers were positioned at the xiphoid, midway between the xiphoid process and umbilicus, and at the umbilicus respectively. When positioned in separate locations results were varied, R2 values ranging from 0.345-0.965. Results highlighted the importance of external surrogate position to the respiratory signal obtained, and indicated that the external marker position on the chest wall needs to be reproducible between 4D CT scanning and treatment.  Recommendations are made that external surrogates must always be positioned at the umbilicus for the most clinically useful scans. Image distortion and artifacts were studied using the Anzai AZ-733V respiratory gating system in combination with the Siemens Sensation Open CT scanner. A moving respiratory phantom was constructed and the volumetric accuracy of retrospectively reconstructed 4D CT images for three moving test objects, across five frequencies and four amplitudes of movement was compared. Volumetric accuracy was found to be within 10% for retrospectively reconstructed gated objects moving with a period of 4 s, amplitude 1 cm.  Large deviations of 19.4-51.6% from the static volume of the objects were observed in gated images for periods of 3 s or less. Significant distortion and under sampling was observed in gated images of the objects moving with a period of 10 s. Artifacts were related to the partial projection effect and data sufficiency conditions outlined in literature (Keall 2004, Pan 2004, Dinkel 2007).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On exploiting spatial reuse in wireless ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Yan, Ziguang</field><field name="description">Wireless ad hoc networks have been increasingly popular in recent years with the development of mobile devices. However, both theoretical and simulation works show that the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks is bounded due to its nature of distributed and multihop. Spatial reuse is a promising technology to increase the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks by allowing more transmissions to occur simultaneously. In this thesis, we enhance 802.11 performances by exploiting the benefits of spatial reuse in wireless ad hoc networks which is achieved by transmission power control (TPC) and directional antennas. We first propose spatial TPC based on basic TPC to fully exploit the benefits of spatial reuse achieved by transmission range control. Simulation results show that spatial TPC achieves higher throughput and lower power consumption compared to 802.11 and basic TPC. We also develop four schemes of directional MAC protocols with the intention of overcoming the new hidden node problem faced by directional antennas. By extensive simulations under different topologies and traffic patterns, we find the directional RTS/CTS (DD) scheme outperforms 802.11 as well as other three schemes by fully exploiting the benefits of spatial reuse achieved by directional antennas.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of biaryl substituted isoquinolines based on the reticuline scaffold</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Stephen R</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the preparation of phenyl-, benzyl-, bisbenzyl- and phenylethylisoquinolines possessing a biaryl moiety, based on the structures of reticuline and laudanosine. The synthetic strategy involves the formation of an appropriately protected biphenyl unit followed by construction of the isoquinoline unit by converting the biphenyl into a 2-[3,4-dimethoxyphenyl]ethylamide, cyclising the amide under Bischler-Napieralski cyclisation conditions and reducing the resulting imine under conditions that will also reductively methylate the isoquinoline nitrogen. In Chapter 2, the bisbenzylisoquinoline 49 was the primary synthetic target. Formation of the biphenyl moiety was investigated using the Ullmann coupling reaction of halides 89 or the oxidative coupling of ester 97 to form the symmetrical biphenyl 94. The Ullmann reaction proved to be the best method for preparing dimer 94, isolated in 69 % yield. Oxidative formation of 94 was achieved with a best yield of 55 % with MoCl5 as the oxidant, however a chlorinated side product was also observed. Following formation of 94, the isoquinoline rings of 49 were built up by formation of the bisamide 100, which cyclised under Bischler-Napieralski to an unstable bisimine. Reduction afforded diastereomeric amines 102, separable by silica gel column chromatography, and reductive methylation of the major diastereomer afforded the bisbenzylisoquinoline 49. Compounds 102 and 49 were subjected to biological assay and found to be poorly biologically active. Our synthetic effort then turned to the preparation of phenyl-, benzyl, and phenylethylisoquinolines each possessing a biaryl moiety. Oxidative coupling, Pd-mediated arylation and the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction were selected as methods for biaryl bond formation, after which we could elaborate the isoquinoline skeleton. The focus of Chapter 3 was the formation of the biaryl bond by oxidative coupling. Ester 145 was selected as the substrate to optimise the oxidation conditions. The hypervalent iodine reagent PIFA proved the most efficient oxidant, yielding the desired biaryl product 146 in 85 % under mild reaction conditions. Nucleophilic ring opening of biaryl lactone 146, hydroxyl protection, Bischler-Napieralski cyclisation and reductive amination afforded benzylisoquinolines 149 and 152. A series of aromatics, linked by an ester tether were prepared, and subjected to oxidation with PIFA. In most cases intramolecular biaryl bond formation failed to occur, largely due to the difference in electron density of the tethered aromatics. Rather, intermolecular dimerisation occurred. Dimers possessing hydroquinone character subsequently oxidised to quinones, while esters possessing a p-methoxy substitution pattern were uniformly cleaved in a DDQ type fashion. In Chapter 4 our attention turned to the preparation of biaryl lactones using the Pdmediated arylation of mono-iodinated aromatics, tethered to an electron rich aromatic by an ester tether. The tether was constructed at specific lengths, such that the biaryl lactone formed would be either a 6-, 7-, or 8-membered fused ring system following biaryl bond formation. Heating of our monoiodinated esters with Pd(II) and a base in DMA in a sealed tube revealed formation of 6-membered rings to be the favoured outcome, particularly when the halogenated ring also possessed an electron withdrawing substitutient, thereby increasing the electrophilic nature of the palladium species following oxidative insertion into the aryl halide bond. Biaryl lactones 242, 243 and 245 were prepared under these conditions, however the lactone stability to aminolysis has prevented their conversion into phenylisoquinolines. Increasing the tether length by one methylene carbon revealed the fragility of phenol derived esters as compounds 258, 260, 262 and 263 all decomposed under the reaction conditions, preventing the formation of 7-membered lactones by this methodology. Increasing the tether length by a second methylene carbon revealed a propensity to form a Pd-enolate, resulting in the formation of cinnamate 265 and isochromans 268 and 275. The chemistry presented in Chapters 3 and 4 revealed some interesting results, however the oxidative coupling and Pd-mediated arylation reactions described did not offer a systematic methodology for the preparation of various isoquinolines possessing a biaryl moiety. In Chapter 5 the Suzuki cross coupling reaction was selected as the method of biaryl bond construction. Electron rich aryl halides 314, 325, and 340 were converted to aryl boronates with bis(pinacolato)diboron in the presence of a Pd catalyst. Boronates 315, 326 and 337 were cross-coupled with the electron deficient iodide 230 in uniformly good yields to furnish biaryls 316, 327 and 338, respectively. Deprotection of biaryl 316 afforded lactone the 317, a compound requiring AlMe3 assisted (Weinreb technology) aminolysis with amine 90. Alcohol protection, Bischler-Napieralski cyclisation and reductive amination afforded phenylisoquinoline 323. Amide boronate 326 crosscoupled exceptionally well with 230 after which Bischler-Napieralski cyclisation and reductive amination afforded the phenylethylisoquinoline 309. Deprotection of biaryl 338 revealed a primary alcohol that required a 2-step oxidation, Dess-Martin periodinane and then NaClO2, to generate the carboxylic acid precursor of the benzylisoquinoline 308. Amide formation, cyclisation and reductive amination converted acid 339 into the benzylisoquinoline 308 in respectable yield. Final compounds and strategic intermediates prepared in Chapters 2-4 were subjected to biological assay. These compounds were tested against 3-cancer cell lines for cytotoxicity in addition to assessment for anti-HIV activity, anti-microbial activity and CNS receptor binding potency. Chapter 6 presents the results of the biological data collected. Unfortunately, each of the compounds assessed were not active enough to xxxwarrant further investigation as therapeutic agents, or were totally inactive. We are yet to submit isoquinolines 308, 309 and 323, prepared in Chapter 5, for biological assay.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The controlled ball milling of titanium and carbon to form TiC</field><field name="creator">Lohse, Benjamin H</field><field name="description">The aim of this work is to improve the understanding of the reaction to form titanium carbide (TiC) during the high-energy milling of titanium and carbon powder mixtures because a more thorough understanding of this reaction is required if high-energy milling is to be developed as a commercially viable process for the production of TiC and/or TiC-Ti powders. Titanium and activated carbon powder mixtures with compositions of Ti100-xCx (x = 50, 40, 30) were milled under a helium atmosphere using a magneto ball mill. For Ti50C50 and Ti60C40 powder mixtures milled in the higher milling energy impact mode, the combined results of external mill temperature monitoring and X-ray diffractometry indicated that, after a specific milling period of tig, TiC was formed rapidly via a highly exothermic mechanically-induced reaction. However, contrary to the current understanding of mechanically-induced self-propagating reactions, Raman spectroscopy clearly showed the formation of non-stoichiometric TiC in Ti50C50 and Ti60C40 powders prior to tig. This result has not been reported in previous studies that used only XRD analysis to characterise the as-milled powders. It is now thought that a significant component of the heat generated at tig may be due to a combination of rapid grain growth and/or recrystallisation of the pre-existing TiC, rather than the direct formation of TiC. When milling Ti70C30 in impact mode, the reaction to form TiC proceeded gradually as milling progressed. It was found that, when milling powder mixtures with compositions of Ti100-xCx (x = 50, 40, 30) in the lower milling energy shearing mode, TiC was formed gradually as milling progressed. It was also found that, for the starting powder compositions investigated in this study, increasing the carbon content of the titanium and activated carbon starting powder mixture results in a slowing of the milling process. This slowing of the milling process is thought to be due to the volume of powder in the milling vial increasing as the carbon content is increased. This would have a similar effect to decreasing the ball to powder weight ratio, which is known to slow the milling process. This study also revealed that moisture adsorbed by the activated carbon starting powder could prevent, or at least delay, the reaction to form TiC during controlled ball milling. It is thought that the moisture adsorbed by the activated carbon may result in the formation of an oxide layer on the newly created titanium surfaces produced during milling, which prevents the reaction to form TiC. The above results demonstrate that controlled ball milling of titanium and carbon powder mixtures using a magneto ball mill can be used to produce nanocrystalline TiC and TiC-Ti powders. Such powders could be used for the synthesis of high-performance TiC reinforced titanium matrix materials.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of superconducting magnesium diboride conductors</field><field name="creator">Soltanian, Saeid</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis concentrates on the fabrication and characterization of MgB2 superconducting bulk wire and tape.

The tape shows a sharp transition with a transition width &#916;Tc of 0.2 K and a Tc0 of 37.5 K. An high transport critical current value of 1.7 &#215; 104 A/cm2 for both 29.5 K in 1 Tesla and 33 K in zero applied field has been achieved. The effects of sintering time and temperature on the formation and critical current densities of Feclad MgB2 wires is also investigated. MgB2 wires were sintered for different periods of time at predetermined temperatures. In contrast to the common practice of sintering for several hours, results show that there is no need for prolonged heat treatment in the fabrication of Fe/MgB2 wires. A total time in the furnace of several minutes is enough to form nearly pure MgB2. Jc of 4.5&#215;105 A/cm2 in zero field and above 105 A/cm2 in 2 T at 15 K has been achieved for Fe/MgB2 wires sintered for a short time. These findings substantially simplify the fabrication process, making it possible to have a continuous process for fabrication and reducing the costs for large-scale production of MgB2 wires. Ag and Cu clad MgB2 wires were also fabricated using an in-situ reaction method. The effects of a shorter than usual sintering on the critical current densities of Ag and Cu clad MgB2 wires were studied. For Ag clad wire Jc is improved by more than two times after the short period sintering process. Jc values of 1.2&#215;105 A/cm2 in zero field and above 104 A/cm2 in 2 T at 20 K have been achieved for Ag clad MgB2 wire which is only sintered for a few minutes at 800 oC. However, a remarkable degree of reaction has been found between the superconducting cores and the sheath materials, leading to the formation of Cu2Mg and Ag3Mg for copper and silver clad wires, respectively. The results show that the short sintering causes less reaction between the magnesium and the sheath materials and markedly improves the critical current density. Our results also show that iron is still the best sheath material for MgB2 superconductor wire and tape. Sixteen-filament stainless steel/Fe/MgB2 wires were fabricated by the powder-in-tube method followed by groove rolling. Magnetic critical current densities of 3.4&#215;105 A/cm2 in 0.5 T and about 1.9&#215;105 A/cm2 in 1 T at 5 K were achieved. Results on transport Jc of solenoid coils up to 100 turns fabricated with Cu-sheathed MgB2 wires using a windreaction in-situ technique are reported. Despite the low density of the single core and some reaction between the Mg and the Cu-sheath, our results demonstrate that the decrease in transport Jc with increasing length of MgB2 wires is insignificant. Solenoid coils with diameters as small as 10 mm can be readily fabricated using a wind-reaction in-situ technique. The Jc of coils is essentially the same as for straight wires. Jc values of 133,000 A/cm2 and 125,000 A/cm2 at 4 K and self field have been achieved for small coil wound using Cu-sheathed tape and Cu-sheathed wire respectively. The results indicate that the MgB2 wires have potential for large scale applications. The effect of chemical doping on the superconductivity and critical current density of MgB2 superconductor is investigated. Enhancements in the Jc field performance as well as the irreversibility field were obtained due to chemical doping with both C and SiC nano-particles. Doping MgB2-x(SiC)x/2 with x = 0, 0.2 and 0.3 and a 10 wt% nano-SiC doped MgB2 sample, led to slight decrease in Tc and significantly enhanced Hc2, Hirr and Jc at high magnetic fields. Compared to the non-doped sample, Jc for the 10 wt% doped sample increased by a factor of 32 at 5 K and 8 T, 42 at 20 K and 5 T, and 14 at 30 K and 2 T. At 20 K, which is considered to be a benchmark operating temperature for MgB2, the best Jc for the doped sample was 2.4&#215;105 A/cm2 at 2 T, which is comparable to Jc of the best Ag/Bi-2223 tapes. At 20 K and 4 T, Jc was 36,000 A/cm2, which is an order of magnitude higher than for the Fe/MgB2 tape. Our results show that there are two distinguishable but closely related mechanisms: increase of Hc2 and improvement of flux pinning that control the performance of Jc(H) in the samples. SiC-doping introduced many nano-scale precipitates and disorders at B and Mg sites, provoking a high resistivity of &#961; (40K) = 300 &#956;&#937;-cm (RRR = 1.75) for the SiC-doped sample, leading to significant enhancement of both Hc2 and Hirr with only minor effects on Tc. EELS and TEM analysis revealed impurity phases: Mg2Si, MgO, MgB4, BOx, SixByOz, and BC at a scale below 10 m and an extensive domain structure of 2-4nm domains in the doped sample which serve as strong pinning centers. The effect of nano-SiC doping on the critical current density and flux pinning of Fe/MgB2 wires is also investigated. The depression of Tc with increasing SiC doping level remained rather small. High level SiC doping resulted in a substantial enhancement in the Jc(H) performance. The transport Jc for all the wires is comparable to the magnetic Jc at higher fields despite the low density of the samples. The transport Ic for the 10 wt% doped Fe/MgB2 wire reached 675 A at 24 K and 1 T (Jc = 140,000 A/cm2) and 500 A at 20 K and 2T (Jc = 103,000A/cm2). The transport Jc for the 10wt% SiC doped MgB2 wire is 30 times higher than for the undoped wire. SiC doped MgB2 polycrystalline samples were fabricated using different grain sizes (20 nm, 100 nm, and 37 &#956;m) of SiC and different doping levels (0, 8, 10, 12, 15 wt %) in order to investigate the effect of the particle size of the starting SiC powder on the properties of samples. Results show that grain sizes of the starting precursors of SiC have a strong effect on the critical current density and its field dependence. The smaller the SiC grains are, the better the Jc field performance is. Significant enhancement of Jc and the irreversibility field Hirr were revealed for all the SiC doped MgB2 with additions up to 15 wt%. A Jc as high as 20,000 A/cm2 in 8 T at 5 K was achieved for the sample doped with 10 wt% SiC with a grain size of 20 nm. Results indicate that the nano-inclusions and substitution inside MgB2 are responsible for the enhancement of flux pinning. Polycrystalline MgB2-xCx samples with x=0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 nano-particle carbon powder were prepared using an in-situ reaction method under well-controlled conditions to limit the extent of C substitution. It was found that both the a-axis lattice parameter and the Tc decreased monotonically with increasing doping level. However, for the sample doped with the highest nominal composition of x=0.4 the Tc dropped only 2.7 K. The nano-C doped samples showed an improved field dependence of the Jc compared with the undoped sample over a wide temperature range. The nhancement by C-doping is not as strong as for nano-SiC doped MgB2. X-ray diffraction results indicate that C reacted with Mg to form nano-size Mg2C3 and MgB2C2 particles. A study of ac susceptibility, magnetic shielding and the sample size effect is presented in Chapter 6. Systematic ac susceptibility measurements were performed on MgB2 bulk samples. It is shown that the flux creep activation energy is a nonlinear function of the current density U , indicating a nonlogarithmic relaxation of the current density in this material. The dependence of the activation energy on the magnetic field is determined to be a power law (J ) &#8733; J &#8722;0.2 U(B) &#8733; B&#8722;1.33 , showing a steep decline in the activation energy with magnetic field, which accounts for the steep drop in the critical current density with magnetic field that is observed in MgB2. Magnetic shielding was investigated by means of transport critical current measurements for Fe-sheathed MgB2 round wires. Strong magnetic shielding by the iron sheath was observed, resulting in a decrease in Ic by only 15% in a field of 0.6 T at 32 K. In addition to shielding, interaction between the iron sheath and the superconductor resulted in a constant Ic between 0.2 and 0.6 T. This was well beyond the maximum field for effective shielding of 0.2 T. This effect can be used to substantially improve the field performance of MgB2/Fe wires at fields at least 3 times higher than the range allowed by mere magnetic shielding by the iron sheath. The dependence of Ic on the angle between the field and the current showed that the transport current does not flow straight across the wire, but meanders between the grains. The effect of sample size on the critical current density and the flux pinning of pure and SiC doped MgB2 bulk samples has been investigated. At high fields a systematic degradation of magnetic Jc and Hirr was observed as the sample size decreased. However, Jc remarkably increased on decreasing the sample volume at low magnetic fields below 1 T. The SiC doped samples show less sample size effect than the pure samples, indicating a larger n-factor and therefore a stronger pinning effect due to SiC doping.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the use of learning objects in the K-12 environment</field><field name="creator">Cotton, Wayne Grant</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been an international agenda to make electronic resources, in the form of learning objects, freely available to teachers and students via on-line databases or repositories. To date, much of the work on these resources has focused on the development of learning objects and the technical aspects of the storage and retrieval processes. Less attention has been paid to the way the learning objects are disseminated and how teachers incorporate the objects into teaching and learning activities. Several researchers (Bennett, Lockyer, &amp; Agostinho, 2004; Hand et al., 2004; Kang, Lim, &amp; Kim, 2003; Koper, 2001b; Laurillard &amp; McAndrew, 2003; Lukasiak et al., 2004; Wiley, 2003) suggest that using generic pedagogical frameworks, known as learning designs, may support teachers who wish to make use of these learning objects. This research study sought out to investigate these claims by designing, developing and evaluating a support system to aid K-12 teachers as they attempt to incorporate learning objects into learning designs. The theories underlying this support system approach are linked to Vygotsky&#8217;s (1978) concept of the zone of proximal development and the notion of scaffolding to assist a learners in making progress on tasks that would otherwise be out of their reach (Davis &amp; Linn, 2000; Edelson, Gordin, &amp; Pea, 1999; Quintana, Eng, Carra, Wu, &amp; Soloway, 1999; Reiser, 2002). Using these ideas as a base it was theorised that a cognitive tool in the form of an Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) could provide the necessary scaffolding to aid teachers through the process of integrating learning objects within pedagogically effective frameworks (i.e., learning designs). The specific learning design used in this study was a WebQuest. This framework was selected because WebQuests are widely known within the K-12 community (Dodge, 1995) and because WebQuests require the use of online resources (i.e., learning objects). To investigate the integration of learning objects within a learning design, a research approach that could encompass the design, development and evaluative nature of the study was needed. One such approach that has been proven to solve similar broad based, complex, real world problems, while at the same time maintaining a commitment to theory construction and explanation, is Reeves&#8217; development research model (Reeves, 2000; Reeves, Herrington, &amp; Oliver, 2004). Using the development research procedures outlined by Reeves, this study initially involved a needs analysis to identify the issues that K-12 teachers faced when they attempted to incorporate learning objects within a specific learning design. Considering the findings from the needs analysis with current peer reviewed literature, a series of design principles were generated. These principles were then used to inform the design, development and testing of a web-based EPSS. The findings of the study suggest that when K-12 teachers attempt to incorporate learning objects within a learning design they face issues in four main areas: 1) limitations in their own technological competency when developing WebQuests; 2) issues relating to how teachers manage the time available to create WebQuests; 3) difficulties in searching for and identifying appropriate learning objects; and 4) maintaining the pedagogical quality within the learning designs. The web-based EPSS developed in this study addressed these issues by supporting the teachers as they incorporated learning designs into their teaching and learning experiences. The EPSS accomplished this by combining specific information, guidance, online tutorials, and a range of pedagogically effective learning design taxonomies into an all encompassing support structure. The study revealed that there are still more opportunities to develop the support system further, particular in relation to managing the time taken to develop WebQuests and to maintaining the pedagogical quality of the teaching and learning experience.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to group key distribution schemes</field><field name="creator">Kurnio, Hartono</field><field name="description">Group-oriented communication has grown considerably with the wide use of broadcasting and multicasting of media content. In most group-oriented applications, access to the communicated content must be restricted to authorised users. These applications include news feeds, Pay-TV and private teleconferencing systems. A commonly used solution for controlling access in a group communication is to encrypt the content using a group key (session key). The group key is only known to the users in the authorized group. A group is called dynamic if the set of authorised group members changes in each session. The group key must be updated in each session to ensure only authorised users of the session can access the content. A group key distribution scheme provides algorithms to establish and maintain the group key. The challenge is to design secure and efficient group key distribution schemes. Security means that the collusion of unauthorised users cannot obtain the group key. Efficiency is measured in terms of the required secure storage, communication bandwidth and computation effort to update the group key. Diverse group applications pose new challenges and designing group key distribution schemes that are tailored to specific group communication scenarios is of high importance. In this thesis, we propose methods of constructing secure and efficient group key distribution schemes with several properties of high interest. We consider group key distribution schemes for completely decentralised environments, and propose secure and efficient constructions for group key distribution schemes where group management operations can be performed by either any group member or a collaboration of several group members. Both these settings have many applications in modern group communication systems. We show correctness of the proposed constructions, prove their security and assess their performance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the effects locust-control pesticides, fenitrothion and fipronil, on avian development using an in ovo model</field><field name="creator">Russ, Melissa</field><field name="description">Locust control operations, carried out by the Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC), typically coincide with times of insect abundance as well as the breeding periods of many oviparous Australian vertebrates. Maternal exposure and storage of pesticides can result in the subsequent deposition of these lipophilic chemicals within the yolk lipids. Thus, these chemicals can be sequestered within an egg, exposing the embryo throughout its in ovo development. Fenitrothion and fipronil are pesticides currently in use by the APLC. A few teratogenic studies have been conducted regarding in ovo exposure to fenitrothion, though exposure occur during the later stages of development and was not modeled as maternal deposition in yolk. To date no in ovo study has investigated the effects of fipronil on development. The lethal effect of fipronil varies widely between species, making toxicity to a given species difficult to predict. Limited research on rats has suggested that fipronil may adversely affect normal thyroid function, causing an increase in thyroid hormone clearance and related changes in thyroid hormone levels and regulation. Using these findings as a starting point, further investigation was warranted into the full extent of fipronil&#65533;s interaction with the thyroid system. Eggs of the domestic chicken were treated in ovo at day 3 of development with either fenitrothion or fipronil over a range of doses. Controls included groups that received the oil vehicle only or that received no injection. Measurements oxygen consumption of embryos were made on days 12, 14, 16, 17 and 18 of incubation. Upon hatch, body mass and skeletal lengths of the skull and tarsus were measured. Blood was collected and analyzed for either cholinesterase inhibition (a biomarker for fenitrothion exposure) or plasma thyroxine levels (for fipronil treated eggs). Embryos treated with fenitrothion did not differ significantly between treatments in hatchability, body mass or skeletal measurements. Plasma total, acetylcholinesterase and butyrlcholinesterase activities followed a weak linear pattern, increasing as the dose increased, but were not significantly different from controls. Oxygen consumption for the control group was significantly higher than the fenitrothion 0.1 and 5.0 mg/kg treatment groups, however none of the treatment groups differed significantly from the oil-injected group. Embryos treated with fipronil in general exhibited lower hatchability at the highest doses, although there were no statistically significant differences between fipronil treated groups and the controls. There were also no statistically significant differences between treatments in body mass or skeletal measurements. While plasma thyroxine levels in general increased with increased dose, there were no statistically significant differences between the fipronil and the oil-treated groups. Oxygen consumption of the embryos in the control group was higher than fipronil-treated groups over time, but there were no statistically significant differences between dose treatments. In a separate pilot study, I gave breeding female Zebra Finches oral doses of fipronil (100, 200 and 500 mg/kg and control oil) to determine the extent of maternal transfer of the pesticide to the egg yolk. All eggs laid by these females were collected within a day of laying for 3 weeks after treatment and analysed for fipronil residues. Although the total number of eggs laid by treated females was small, there was a weak dose dependency in fipronil deposition in yolk. The degree to which this may affect embryo development was not examined as part of this thesis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Bangladeshi plays considered in postcolonial context</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Khairul Haque</field><field name="description">There is no full-length investigation of postcoloniality in Bangladeshi Bengali literature. This is partly because Bangladesh had no separate identity under colonial rule, being just another part of greater India. Then, at partition, it became one section of the unnatural union that was Pakistan. These two identities have kept Bangladesh as a relatively unknown domain, at least to the Western academy. The other reason in the context of literary postcolonial studies is that these have concentrated on writing in English, whereas Bangladeshi literature is almost completely in the national language.

The original axisymmetric analysis and plane strain analysis of vertical drains including the effect of smear and well resistance have been well documented in the past for surcharge preloading. In this study, the existing axisymmetric and plane strain theories of a unit cell are modified to incorporate the vacuum pressure application. Unsaturation of drain soil boundary owing to the vacuum pressure is also considered in the numerical modeling. Thereafter, a multi-drain, plane strain analysis is conducted to study the performance of the entire embankment stabilised with vertical drains subjected to vacuum preloading, for two case histories taken from Thailand. A laboratory technique of evaluating the effectiveness of combined vacuum and surcharge preloading is elaborated. In this approach, a central vertical drain was installed in soil specimens placed in a large stainless steel cell (450 mm in diameter and 950 mm in height) using a specially designed mandrel, and then the vacuum and surcharge loads were applied using the two different loading systems. The results clearly show the effectiveness of vacuum preloading. Following initial laboratory simulation in the large-scale radial drainage consolidometer, a different approach to conventional analysis is adopted to analyse the vacuum assisted consolidation around vertical drains. It is assumed here that a linear variation of negative pore pressure along the drain length and a constant (maximum) suction head at the ground surface are realistic and sufficient. The observed retardation of pore pressure dissipation is explained through a series of finite element models, which consider the effect of unsaturation at the drain-soil interface. The results indicate that the introduction of an unsaturated soil layer adjacent to a PVD improves the accuracy of numerical predictions. The knowledge gained from the modeling of large-scale consolidometer cell is applied to study the behaviour of two embankments built on soft clay, stabilised with vertical drains subjected to vacuum loading. A multi-drain analysis is conducted and the field measurements are compared with a series of numerical model predictions. The best predictions of settlement, lateral displacements and pore pressures are obtained when the numerical analysis included the time and depth dependent changes in vacuum pressure, in addition to having an unsaturated layer of elements along the external boundary of the PVD. Finally, a comprehensive multi-drain analysis is used to predict the failure height of embankment, considering various parameters such as embankment geometry, construction method, sub soil properties and soil improvement techniques.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harmonic management in mv distribution systems</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Duane</field><field name="description">With many distribution customer loads being sensitive to excessive harmonic voltage distortion, electricity distribution network service providers should now be looking towards preventative measures to ensure that voltage distortion levels remain within limits set by the appropriate standards. Measures will need to be taken at the planning stage to ensure distribution systems are able to meet harmonic limits recommended by standards as distortion due to loads increases. This thesis describes the development of harmonics planning and analysis tools that allow effective system modelling and comparison with standards, particularly in the planning phase where details of loads are usually not accessible. In this thesis development of statistical harmonic models of residential, commercial and industrial load types to simulate the global behaviour of distorting loads at distribution substations is presented. Both time and phase diversities are included in the representative load models. A method to estimate the 95(superscript th) percentile cumulative probability level of harmonic voltage distortion in an MV distribution system as required by the present Australian harmonic standard (AS/NZS 61000.3.6) is also developed. Results from a harmonic monitoring programme carried out on a typical MV distribution system are used to establish parameters for the load models and also to confirm the relative accuracy of the proposed distortion level prediction technique. A generalised method to extend the IEC 61000-3-6 approach of allocating allowable harmonic emissions to the case where customers are distributed along an MV distribution system feeder having significantly different fault levels is presented. The method involves the determination of an allocation constant using the agreed loading of all customers and the system harmonic impedances. This approach typically requires an extensive amount of data that may not always be available to distribution network service provider engineers. An extension to the method has thus been established to cater for the situation where only limited data is available. This is achieved by looking at several extreme cases that classify the most common MV distribution system feeder configurations and through the use of correction factors for the allocation constant. Several example systems have been studied to illustrate the harmonic management tools described above. These case studies include identification of the key indicators for harmonic performance of a distribution system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining quality services in Thai accredited hospitals in a climate of economic uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Sitakalin, Panee</field><field name="description">In 1997, Thailand suffered a severe economic downturn. The government was obliged to control health spending whilst also attempting to maintain the quality of hospital services. In the same year, the Thailand Hospital Accreditation Program (HA-Thai) was established. This built on earlier accreditation schemes, and an initial group of thirty-five public and private hospitals joined the program. This study explores the strategies the managers of these 35 hospitals used to maintain the quality of their services since the economic downturn. It also investigated the managers&#8217; perception and understanding of the Hospital Accreditation Program. Little is currently known about the use of quality management within Thai hospitals. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of how hospital quality management was being implemented and how its practices were affected by the economic crisis.The study used a mixed method approach. This was felt to be appropriate given the little that was known about quality management in Thai hospitals. Baseline data were collected by a survey questionnaire. This collected data on which components of Total Quality Management (TQM) were used by the thirty-five hospitals. The hospitals were also requested to provide their strategic plans (or other planning documentation) and their financial reports or annual budgets between 1996-1999. Finally, interviews were conducted with thirty-two top and middle managers from four public hospitals in different provinces and of different size. Public hospitals were selected because they had less access to alternative means of funding than private hospitals and, therefore, their quality programs may have been affected more by the economic downturn.The survey questionnaire was returned by 28 hospitals (80%) in the HA Thai program. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess whether quality management activity was related to public/private status, hospital size, location and whether the hospital was fully or partially accredited. The small sample size lacked sufficient power to identify any statistically significant relationships. Nonetheless, various features were noticeable in the responses of the hospitals. Many had adopted core aspects of TQM, including the communication of the quality management principles, extensive training for various categories of staff, a customer focus, and a broad involvement of staff in hospital decision making. Fewer had strategic plans that included quality, and over half of those hospitals responding thought TQM was an adjunct to management practices rather than being fully integrated. Few hospitals used quality costing, or appeared to understand the concept.All respondents reported collecting data on quality performance from either patient and staff surveys (or both), as well as using customer complaints. These data were primarily used to improve performance in specific areas, but none seemed to use widespread statistical monitoring. Eight hospitals reported benchmarking their services. Nursing and administrative tasks were most involved in implementing quality programs. But despite this, the perceived success of the TQM initiatives was limited. No hospital reported a decline in costs, average length of stay, customer complaints, or number of re-admissions. This may have been linked to barriers that the hospitals reported to TQM implementation. Some hospitals reported that it was too expensive, did not have support of key personnel, or had found that information was either not available or too difficult to obtain. These were consistent with problems reported in other studies but may also reflect the difficult financial circumstances that the hospitals were operating under.The 32 interviewed managers provided greater insight into their approach to quality management. They revealed that each of the four hospitals implemented quality strategies, including joining the HA-Thai program as a way to maintain quality during the economic downturn. The strategies increased the public recognition of the hospitals and were regarded as helping the hospitals cut costs while maintaining quality. The CEOs were regarded as being the main quality instigator. Nonetheless, there were many uncertainties for hospital staff, notably job security. Increased workloads from new quality related administration and increased patient demand, fewer resources and decreased training opportunities were common experiences. The clinical managers had some concerns about the appropriateness of the HA-Thai program for clinical services, and doctors were reported to be apprehensive, feeling they had not been consulted. Doctors also believed they were already providing a quality service. Overall, the managers thought the benefits outweighed the difficulties involved in setting up the program.The analysis of strategic plans was fairly limited. The survey responses suggested that 16 hospitals had strategic plans, and nine hospitals submitted planning documents. Not all documents were complete and many did not contain an internal/external analysis of the hospital&#8217;s operating environment. Yet, all plans were produced in 1997 or after, demonstrating their importance to senior management. Moreover, several contained objectives that directly related to the economic crisis.All hospitals made some mention of quality in their plans, but it is quite limited for several hospitals. All but two hospitals mentioned training, although it is unclear whether there was more or less than before the crisis. This seems to show a commitment to quality improvement as the direct effect of training is difficult to quantify. Another common quality initiative was to apply for ISO9002 accreditation. This also indicated a strong quality focus because the ISO9002 scheme involves extensive documentation and its implementation is likely to increase costs.What the plans did not contain was also interesting. None of the plans reflected a complete &#8220;customer focus&#8221;. This was demonstrated by a lack of commitment to consulting with the local community and only a few plans contained strategies to involve customers or staff. Other aspects of TQM that were not mentioned included quality costing, and benchmarking.Unfortunately, the final aspect of the analysis provided little insight. Few hospitals supplied financial reports, possibly for commercial/privacy reasons. Moreover, the information in the supplied documents was not sufficiently consistent nor detailed to determine how the economic crisis affected individual hospitals.In conclusion, the study findings suggest that these 35 Thai hospitals maintained a commitment to quality management during the economic crisis. Managers appear to be convinced of the long term benefits, and are prepared to work through the difficulties of implementation, including some staff dissatisfaction and an apparent lack of measurable benefits. Despite the economic downturn, the hospitals continued to adopt various quality initiatives, involving mainly nursing and administrative staff. They also continued to provide quality training. In other areas, the use of TQM principles seemed less developed. The study did not identify examples of statistical monitoring, or the use of quality costing. In relation to the HA-Thai accreditation program, the managers were convinced that external accreditation was required to ensure the reputation of their organisation in the community. The managers did not view it uncritically, however, and suggested that it needed to increase transparency and clarity of instructions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of radiolabelled peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands for imaging cancer and neurodegenerative disorders</field><field name="creator">Homes, Taryn P</field><field name="description">Three classes of compounds were chosen for investigation to find a high affinity and selective iodinated peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand; indol-3-ylglyoxylamides, pyrazolopyrimidines, and pyridopyrrolooxazepines and pyrrolobenzoxazepines. These compounds were chosen from a literature search for their high PBR affinity and selectivity, ease of synthesis, and the potential for radioiodination.Fifteen new halogenated N,N-dialkylindol-3-ylglyoxylamides were synthesised and tested for their PBR and central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) affinity. The compounds IC50 values for the PBR ranged from 7.8 &#8211; 618 nM, and a structure activity relationship (SAR) was determined. Brominated compounds had higher binding affinities than their iodinated analogues, and indoles with a chloro substituent on position 5 had higher binding affinities than the non-chlorinated compounds. The optimum alkyl chain length was found to be two carbons. The highest affinity iodinated ligand, with a PBR IC50 of 8.2 nM, was radiolabelled with 123I in 55-60% radiochemical yield and evaluated in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats. Biodistribution studies revealed high uptake of the radiotracer in organs known to contain PBR, such as the kidneys, adrenals, heart, liver and lungs. Drug competition studies showed that the PBR drugs PK11195 and Ro5-4864, when injected into the rat 5 min prior to injection of the radiotracer, significantly decreased uptake of radiotracer into those organs. The CBR drug, flumazenil, did not decrease the uptake of the radiotracer. Metabolite studies showed that the radiotracer was &gt; 95% intact in the heart, kidneys, adrenals, and brain after 3 h and was 65% intact in the plasma. This compound is the first radiolabelled PBR ligand of this class, and is an excellent candidate for future studies and may lead to a clinically useful imaging agent.Three pyrazolopyrimidines were synthesised, with lengths of the alkyl chains being methyl, ethyl, or propyl groups. The highest affinity ligand, with the propyl groups, displayed an IC50 of 7.9 nM, however, only the compound with ethyl groups displaying an IC50 of 11.7 nM was radiolabelled with 123I in 95% radiochemical yield, and evaluated in vivo in rats. This compound showed high uptake into organs known to contain PBR, and also showed an interesting result in which pre-administration of Ro5-4864 did not cause any significant decrease of uptake of radiotracer in the kidney or heart, however PK11195 did cause of significant decrease in these organs. This compound provides the first radioiodinated PBR ligand of this class.Two pyrrolopyridooxazepines and two pyrrolobenzoxazepines were synthesised and tested. One of the compounds was found to be inactive, while the others had moderate PBR IC50 values of 24-39 nM. The moderate binding affinity for these compounds would unlikely lead to a successful imaging agent.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and analysis of innovative image making processes in abstract painting</field><field name="creator">Millward, William</field><field name="description">For this study, two series of abstract paintings have been produced, each demonstrating a distinctive and different working process. The analysis of these methods forms the catalyst and the main focus in the argument for a reappraisal of formalist theory within contemporary art practice. The working methods establish a significant departure from the conventions of painting influenced by formalist theory and culminating in the New York school of Abstract Expressionists in the middle of the twentieth century, where the expressive mark or gesture made by the artist was of paramount value. Instead, methods that provide for a disconnection from the expressive mark have been developed; such as a press and release technique similar to mono-printing; and a method that involves the movement of the canvas support rather than the expressive movement of the hand or arm of the maker. Formalism became the dominant theory in western visual arts in the middle of the twentieth century but for the past forty years has been seriously challenged by postmodern artists, critics and theorists. An historical background of formalism articulated by Roger Fry (1909; 1920), Clive Bell (1958) and Clement Greenberg (1939; 1940; 1960; 1961) is presented together with a critique of formalist thought by Suzi Gablik (1991; 2001), Rosalind Krauss (1981; 1993), and Thomas McEvilley (1990; 1993; 1996). The methods that have been developed in the production of the paintings, and how they relate to the issues raised in the analysis of formalism are discussed. In particular, issues relating to the role of the individual as painter, the disconnection from the expressive mark, and the content and meaning within the work are examined. The contrasting working methods of Irish American artist Sean Scully (b.1945) and German artist Gerhard Richter (b.1932) are used to illustrate this examination. A more moderate approach to formalism rather than the exclusive and extreme position held by Greenberg is proposed, one that still focuses on the formal qualities of the work as a primary consideration in the making and evaluation, but acknowledging other influences within the process of production, which in turn influence the reading of the final work. Many artists such as Mark Rothko (1952), Robert Motherwell (1982) and Howard Hodgkin (1996) have identified the retention of integrity as an essential quality within a painting. Jacques Maritain (1943; 1953) has presented an analysis of how truth and honesty is embedded in painting, but most writers and scholars have largely ignored him. By utilising his arguments, it is argued here that the integrity of the method of production is a vital characteristic in the evaluation of a painting and this thesis explores how it can be corrupted as well as retained. The significance of this body of work is that it extends the range of methods of image making within the field of abstract painting, particularly those that do not involve the expressive mark of the maker. Furthermore, it addresses the issue of integrity within the method of production in the visual arts, which is largely neglected in current literature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observations on the cryptologic properties of the AES algorithm</field><field name="creator">Song, Beomsik</field><field name="description">The AES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher, which will replace DES for the next few decades. This cipher has been reputed to be secure against conventional cryptanalytic methods, such as DC (Differential Cryptanalysis) and LC (Linear Cryptanalysis), but the simple algebraic structure of the cipher has led to some commentators' concerns about its security. The purpose of this study is to observe the cryptologic properties of the AES algorithm from a new point of view, and to examine the security of this cipher on the basis of these observations. Some well-known research studies on the security of the AES algorithm are reviewed first, classified into four categories. We then discuss the cyclic properties and consistent differential patterns of this cipher using our own observations, which have been introduced in [7, 8, 9]. In terms of the cyclic properties of the AES algorithm, we have observed that every function used in the AES algorithm has a very short period, and that each layer has a short period as well. But we note that although the maximal periods of both the non-linear layer and the linear layer are short, the maximal period is dramatically increased when these two layers are combined. However, more importantly, we have observed that the AES algorithm still has a very unusual cyclic property for certain types of input blocks even in the combined layer, so that input blocks having short periods have simple hidden algebraic relations with their corresponding output blocks. In conjunction with the consistent differential patterns of the AES algorithm, we note that the AES structure is very well designed to be secure against DC and LC, as has previously been known. But we have also observed that it leads to some consistent differential patterns after certain rounds, which can be used for its cryptanalysis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of aerobic and resistance training on insulin sensitivity, muscle composition and dietary fat intake</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Adam</field><field name="description">Insulin resistance (IR) is thought to be a major aetiological factor in the development in type II diabetes and the Metabolilc Syndrome, yet the underlying mechanisms behind IR remain unknown. Both resistance (RT) and aerobic (AT) exercise training lead to an increase in insulin sensitity (IS), however it is uncertain as to whether the effect of exercise on IS extends beyond the last exercise bout and which mode of exercise (RT or AT) is most beneficial. A human exercise intervention trial comparing the effect of RT and AT on insulin sensitivity measured 72 hours after the last exercise bout was used to examine the two previous questions. The oxidative capacity of the muscle and the membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition are considered possible mechanisms relating exercise and IR. Both of these were measured to see if the changes in IS parallel these proposed mechanistic markers. A previous animal study has shown that exercising rats have lower levels of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes compared to sedentary rats, suggesting that exercise may have a negative effect on one of the possible mechanisms related to IS. This thesis set out to replicate this finding in animals and determine if the same relationship is seen in humans. Also diet composition was monitored in both rats and humans to determine if exercise induced changes in membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition have an effect on dietary intake. The first study performed was a human exercise intervention trial. 20 healthy sedentary males aged between 30 and 55 years were randomly allocated into either an AT group or RT group. Both groups exercised for 10 weeks, 3 times per week for 45 minutes each session. Total amount of work (kJ) performed during each training session was matched for both groups. Following training fasting insulin levels(In transformed) did change significantly (p(less than)0.05) in both groups (2.8 + 0.11 to 2.58 + 0.13, AT: 2.67 + 0.14 to 2.59 + 0.17, RT) with the reduction in the AT group appearing to be greater than the RT group. Peripheral IS, measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps, did not change significantly over the training period in either group (4.3 + 0.3 to 4.8 + 0.7, AT: 4.4 + 0.9 to 4.2 + 0.8, RT mg.kg(superscript -1).min(superscript -1). Hepatic insulin resistance, indexed by HOMA-R, reduced significantly in both groups over the training period (1.3 + 0.1 to 1.1 + 0.1, AT: 1.3 + 0.2 to 1.2 + 0.2, RT). Citrate Synthase activity in skeletal muscle increased significantly in both groups over the training period (12.3 + 1.3 to 17.4 + 1.1, AT: 12.2 + 0.8 to 15.1 + 0.9, RT ?mol.min(superscript -1).g(superscript -1). Unsaturation index (UI) a measure of membrane fluidity, increased significantly in both groups (157.7 + 3.8 to 163.4 + 3.4, AT 142.6 + 10.4 to 150.5 + 8.9, RT). Both groups exhibited a significant decrease in poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption (14.6 + 1.9 to 13.0 + 0.9, AT: 20.9 + 2.2 to 16.3 + 0.9, RT % of total fat intake) and a significant increase in saturated fatty acid (SFA) consumption (47.46 + 2.1 to 48.14 + 1.3, AT: 39.6 + 3.1 to 44.6 + 2.0, RT % of total fat intake). The 10 week exercise programs in humans had no effect on peripheral IS 72 hours after the last exercise bout, indicating that the effect of exercise on peripheral IS is an acute one. However there was a significant decrease in hepatic IR over the training period in both groups 72 hours after the last exercise bout. In addition the majority of this effect appeared to occur in the AT group. The therapeutic implication of this finding is that for maximum effect on insulin sensitivity individuals should exercise more frequently than every 72 hours and that their program should be based on AT. An anecdotal observation made by the author of this thesis was that the RT program was much better received than the AT program. There fore the inclusion of RT may improve compliance in an exercise training program. No strong relationship between changes in skeletal muscle citrate synthase and IS was found. A favourable change in the membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition of both groups, as indicated by an increase in the UI of both groups was not related to changes in IS. Thus the oxidative capacity of the muscle and the fluidity of the skeletal muscle membrane may not be central mechanisms in the relationship between IS and exercise. The animal exercise study saw 12 female Wistar rats randomly allocated into 2 groups, a sedentary control group (SED; n=6) and an exercise group (EX; n=6), performing voluntary wheel cage running. Rats in both groups had adlibitum access to 2 diets which were identical except for fat composition, with one diet high in saturated fat and the other high in unsaturated fat. The exercise period lasted for 34 days with an eight day baseline period. Upon conclusion all rats were fasted for 24 hours, killed and their red quadriceps extracted. The UI of the EX group (214 + 5.5 EX) was significantly lower than the SED group (232.2 + 3.5 SED). During baseline, diet preference between the two groups did not differ, however during the exercise period of the EX group consumed significantly more of the unsaturated fat diet (62.9 + 7.1 - 59.5 + 5.4, SED; 65.1 + 5.2 - 71.7 + 5.3, EX; % intake). Distance ran was shown to have an effect on dietary intake with the greater the distance ran the more unsaturated diet consumed (F(1,9) = 5.29, P = 0.024). Both the human and rat studies showed a significant change in dietary intake in response to the exercise training. The rat study showed that exercise lead to an increase in the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids. An intriguing possibility for this change in diet intake is that the rats, driven by some intrinsic drive were attempting to replenish their membranes. In humans the opposite occurred with a decrease in PUFA consumption and an increase in SFA consumption. This could suggest that no such intrinsic drive exists in humans. However instinctual dietary choices of the human subjects may have been altered by social and media influences promoting reduced total fat consumption. An unintended and potentially deleterious consequence of this may be a selective reduction in intake of the more visible PUFA component of dietary fat.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology and the improvement of mathematics education at the tertiary level</field><field name="creator">Aminifar, Elahe</field><field name="description">In recent times, technology is being used more and more in a variety of educational endeavours. This thesis considers the use of technology in the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics in higher education. In particular, it addresses, through three case studies, specific technological solutions to two well documented educational problems: the knowledge gap between secondary school and university level mathematics and how to provide higher level, honours or postgraduate, mathematics offering despite low student numbers.A literature review provides the context of the problem and an overview of previous attempts at solving this difficulty.The first case study addresses a common problem concerning students entering university from high school. It has been reported that students who enter university have insufficient mathematics knowledge and skills to take first year mathematics subjects and hence provide a sound mathematical foundation for other subjects. In this study at the University of Wollongong, video learning resources, predominantly worked solutions, have been developed to assist Engineering students in a first year mathematics subject. The four-stage evaluation model of Alexander and Hedberg (1994) was used to determine the effectiveness of the resources involved at each of the stages: Design, Development, Implementation and Institutionalisation. Evaluation addresses both the production methods and the learning outcomes. A mixed methodology combining surveys, interviews, and document analysis, was used to triangulate evaluation results at each of the four stages.In 2006, two different technologies were used to produce video resources for a limited number of mathematics questions. In the first instance this was to determine the ease of production and the students&#8217; preferences for the resources. Following this trial, a set of video resources which covered all the topics taught during the first four weeks of the teaching session was developed. These resources were used to examine whether or not they could be used to bridge the gap from high school to university. Analysis indicated that the resources were used by students whose mean baseline performance was lower than non-users (t 74 = 2.18, p = 0.033). In week four the results of Basic Skills Test 2 revealed that students who used the resources improved more than those who did not (t 72 = 2.43, p = 0.018), however, catching-up on fundamental mathematical skills was insufficient for there to be an impact on the final results in the subject. Surveys in the middle and at the end of the teaching session showed that students found the video resources were useful in helping them to learn and understand mathematics. Consequently, a set of video resources that covered all mathematics topics in the subject was developed for incoming students in 2007. To ascertain the impact of these resources, two cohorts of students were examined: students from 2004 with no resources and students in 2007 with a complete set of resources. Having established that baseline performance was the same, the students with resources were found to have improved their performance in all assessment tasks compared to students without resources: Basic Skills Test 2 (t 390 = 3.14, p = 0.002), assignments (t 456 = 2.80, p = 0.005), quizzes (t 456 = 3.49, p = 0.001), examination marks  (t 456 = 3.03, p = 0.003), and final marks (t 446 = 2.38, p = 0.018), except in the Mid-Session Test (t 467 = 0.65, p = 0.519). The failure rate fell significantly in 2007 compared to the years between 2000 and 2006 (Z = 2.10, p &lt; 0.05). Students&#8217; surveys suggest that while the primary gains have been in algorithmic learning, students consider they have better understanding of concepts. The final stage of institutionalisation reveals that the university has adopted and further extended the approach for the development of mathematics learning resources across disciplines.The second case study addressed the use of two-way communication technologies for teaching and learning for geographically dispersed students at the tertiary level and in particular, for mathematics. To do this, the author of this thesis worked in an apprenticeship model with the guidance of the Manager of Learning Facilities and Technologies at the University of Wollongong to compare a selection of Real Time Communication (RTC) technologies using several criteria. These were based on the needs of teachers and students, the institutional infrastructure and the literature. As there are a variety of Real Time Communication (RTC) technologies, a two-stage evaluation was adopted. In the first stage, a list of RTC technologies was composed based on criteria found in advertising and promotional materials. In the second stage, each of the short-listed RTC technologies was trialled to determine their effectiveness and efficiency in teaching and learning. At the end of this case study, one of the RTC technologies, which provides multiple video and audio tracks of all participants as well as application sharing such as shared desktop and whiteboard, namely Access Grid, was installed and trialled.With two other universities, also funded by the International Centre of Excellence for Education in Mathematics (ICE-EM), the opportunity arose for the third case study focussing on the question, &#8216;How do universities provide a wide range of subjects to honours and upper level students when numbers of mathematics students and staff are small?&#8217;. The aim of installing a room-based node on the Access Grid was to teach and share the mathematics and statistics subjects with other Australian universities which had installed a room-based node. Three lecturers and eight students were interviewed and surveyed to evaluate the use of the Access Grid in teaching and learning these subjects. The lecturers and the students were tolerant of many technical failures, expecting them as part of the process of introducing new technology and recognising the opportunity provided by sharing classes. Two issues were identified: the need to train staff in the use of new pedagogical approaches and the fact that lecturers did not necessarily perceive the communication difficulties experienced by their students.The thesis concludes with a look to the future of technology in mathematics education and makes recommendations for embedding video resources within subjects in the other disciplines. Recommendations are also made for the use of synchronous technology such as Access Grid in teaching and learning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longitudinal study of behaviour-disordered adolescents and the effects on them of a wilderness-enhanced program</field><field name="creator">Brand, Dell</field><field name="description">Juvenile delinquency is a major problem. It is not new, but there are signs that it is becoming more widespread and that the degree of delinquency is worsening. It is a twofold burden on society, both economically and socially, as many people can be affected by just one delinquent adolescent.If it is possible to identify and work with adolescents at risk of becoming delinquent when they are in the pre-delinquent, or at-risk stage, or young adolescents just beginning a delinquent career, it may be possible to change their attitudes and behaviours, and so avert a delinquent future and the twofold burden on society. For this change to occur, the treatment used must be effective.In general, treatment programs for this population have met with limited success. Many have been shown to have limited application or to have not impacted positively on the adolescents and not affected recidivism rates. Some programs which have reported short-term and anecdotal success have been wilderness-enhanced programs. However many of these have had shortcomings. Some have had limited conceptualisation, some have had a too-short duration and some have had inadequate follow-up. Many wilderness-enhanced programs have been well-intentioned, by caring and experienced leaders, but have lacked a sound theoetical base and have, instead, been devised by a'gut' feeling for what will best help these students. Other programs have lacked the support, both financial and in time available, to effectively help the students.Results from the research that has been done have generally supported short-term improvement in adolescents' behaviour after a wilderness-enhanced program intervention. However, conclusive evidence of sustained behaviour change has not been forthcoming. Most of the research has centred in the United States of America and, in Australia, very little has been done. Evaluation of these types of programs in schools in New South Wales, Australia, is only just beginning to emerge. Longitudinal studies are rare.This thesis examined a program which was based on amore adequate explanation of causes. It contained a wilderness component and made use of cognitive-based therapy in the lengthy followup period. The thesis used a longitudinal tracking method, with a pre and post test and a control group. It also had a reference group of normal-stream adolescent students. This was to account for attitudinal and behavioural changes with maturation and to establish normative ranges of behaviour to which the treatment and control groups' responses could be compared. This study has provided valuable information on the developmental nature of at-risk delinquency in adolescence, which may assist in future research and may also provide the basis on which future programs can be developed. It has also evaluated a current program's impact on at-risk adolescents and ascertained the degree of success it is having.The study used Jessor and Jessor's Problem Behaviour Proneness model as a guide. Thirty-one scales were developed which tested variables deemed by Jessor and Jessor (1977) to be good predictors of problem behaviour proneness.The subjects were tested five times over a two-year period. The treatment group was compared to both the control group and the reference group. Several analyses were carried out on the data. Firstly, a multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted on a longitudinal subset of students who were present at every data collection point. This was to ascertain changes in the groups over time. Secondly, aone-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the groups at different points in time. This used the cross-sectional data set, which contained a much larger number of students' responses. The results ofthe ANOVA analyses gave snapshots in time whereas the MANOVA gave indications of change over time. Finally, t-tests were carried out on the treatment group at different times to ascertain whether observed changes were, in fact, significant.The wilderness-enhanced program of two years duration did appear to cause changes in maladaptive behaviour. Twenty-two of the variables showed improvement in attitude and behaviour over this time and seventeen of these were statistically significant. The most significant areas of change were in commitment to school, self-esteem, locus of control and the influence of parents and the peer group. When these significant changes are overlaid with the seemingly positive effects on most of the other variables, even though these were not statistically significant effects, the argument for the effectiveness of the wilderness-enhanced program is strengthened.  The initial wilderness experience appeared to be important in the change process. Although early change was generally not significant, it was nonetheless present and this seems to support the idea that the experience acts as a catalyst. Most variables revealed an immediate improvement in behaviour or attitude following the wilderness experience. It was this early sign of a willingness or desire to change by the treatment group that the intervention follow-up program utilised to bring about lasting change.  The changes were of sufficient magnitude in nineteen of the variables to bring the treatment group into the normal range of behaviour for adolescents, as exemplified by the reference group in this study. Seventeen of these were statistically significant.  The treatment group moved from having nineteen variables indicative of promoting problem  behaviour proneness at the commencement of the study to only having six at the end. Thus the  treatment group's propensity to problem behaviour proneness seemed to have reduced significantly.  Many of the improvements in behaviour occurred late in the two-year follow-up period, so it appears  vital that a lengthy follow-up period is part of any multivariate program.  These results may be used as justification for wilderness-enhanced programs to be funded in the future. The general positive direction found in the study seems to be an argument for practical application. This is also in keeping with previous research on the short-term effects of wilderness enhanced programs and on the abundance of anecdotal evidence in existence. As there seems to be a growing number of adolescents displaying problem behaviours, and as schools are reporting ever increasing numbers of students needing specialist intervention help with their behaviour, this type of intervention seems viable. Schools are in an ideal position to identify these at-risk students and direct them into this type of intervention program. Problem behaviour appears to be successfully challenged through these programs. It also is reported to be very cost-effective in comparison to other alternatives used as intervention. So it would seem eminently sensible to continue to fund this wilderness-enhanced model.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marcel Dupre - the culmination of the french symphonic organ tradition</field><field name="creator">Dries, Daniel Michael</field><field name="description">This study examines the significance of the work of Marcel Dupr&#65533; in the development of the French Symphonic Organ Tradition. The study focusses on Dupr&#65533;s work as an organist, composer, transcriber and editor of organ music. The study consists of two parts: a)Performance project: The performance project consisted of four recitals of music composed, transcribed or edited by Dupr&#65533;. The recitals also included a small number of works by composers who exercised a significant influence on Dupr&#65533;. The recordings of these live recitals are included with the thesis. b)Thesis: The thesis examines Dupr&#65533;s early development and primary influences, as well as the general development of the French Symphonic Organ Tradition. The thesis also examines Dupr&#65533;s career as a liturgical organist, an international virtuoso, and as a teacher of generations of organist/composers. The thesis analyses various aspects of performance and interpretation of the organ works presented in the performance project. The thesis documents the influence of Dupr&#65533; on the development of the French Symphonic Tradition across a number of traditions. It shows that, while there have been many prolific organist/composers associated with the French Symphonic Tradition, Dupr&#65533; personified the principles of this school more than any organist of his generation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legitimating Astronomy</field><field name="creator">Howard, Graham</field><field name="description">Science is usually justified in terms of its utilitarian attributes. Modern professional astronomy has no obvious utilitarian rationale, yet it receives considerable resources to carry on its work. Concepts from the sociology of science and political sociology can be used to help explain this apparent puzzle. The means by which astronomy succeeds in procuring resources can be seen in terms of a process of legitimation. Professional astronomy justifies and explains itself to specific audiences, ensuring that funding agencies will see astronomy as worthy of support. Several activities are suggested as legitimation practices. The mechanics of funding are discussed, followed by a description of modern professional astronomy as a 'big science'. Boundary work and popularisation are examined as important legitimation practices. Boundary work constructs a path for astronomy that legitimises it by allying the field to successful sciences such as physics, and distancing it from other activities such as ufology and astrology. Astronomy is popular with the public, and this popularity gives rise to a groundswell of support, and is used to promote astronomy as educating a public that will support science in general. The professional structures of astronomy serve to mark out astronomers as an elite scientific group, with an esoteric knowledge that includes high levels of mathematics. Astronomers' specialist technical skills can be of use in a variety of situations, but the scientific and mathematical knowledge itself also contributes to successful legitimation. It is concluded that the primary rationale for the funding of astronomy is humanistic rather than utilitarian.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lomonosov's bastards: Anatolii Fomenko, pseudo-history and Russia's search for a post-communist identity</field><field name="creator">Konstantin, Sheiko</field><field name="description">Anatolii Fomenko is a distinguished Russian mathematician turned popular history writer. He is the founder of New Chronology, part of the explosion of pseudo-history that has emerged in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Among his more startling claims are that the Old Testament was written after the New Testament, that Russia is older than Greece and Rome and that the medieval Mongol Empire was in fact a Slav-Turk world empire, a Russian Horde, to which Western and Eastern powers paid tribute. Fomenko takes inspiration from Mikhail Lomonosov, Russia&#65533;s most celebrated eighteenth century scientist and self-taught patriotic historian. Lomonosov was a layman in matters of history, who was given to patriotic excess but whose account of the past fell within the bounds of what is usually considered to be history. The same is not true of Fomenko whose account of the past is as fantastic as it is popular. The question of this thesis is why such accounts of the past are written and, more importantly, read in post-Communist Russia. I conclude that Fomenkos version of the past is popular because he finds in history a simple and usable answer to the question of who the Russians are. Fomenko taps into existing Russian notions of identity, specifically the widespread belief in the positive qualities of empire and the special mission of Russia. He has drawn upon previous attempts to establish a Russian identity, ranging from Slavophilism through Stalinism to Eurasianism. Fomenkos account of the past speaks to the Russian present, which, in the absence of Ukraine and Belarus, is much more firmly placed at the centre of the Eurasian land-mass than it was under the Tsars or Communists. While fantastic, Fomenkos pseudo-history strikes many Russian readers as no less legitimate than the lies and distortions peddled not just by Communist propagandists but also by tsarist historians and church chroniclers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing lives: a personal construct approach to menopause</field><field name="creator">Foster, Heather</field><field name="description">This thesis argues the need for an exploration of the meanings, and pathways to reconstruction, of women anticipating or experiencing menopause, and that a personal construct approach can provide a creative context for meeting this need. Very few psychologically based interventions for menopausal women have been reported in the menopausal literature. I describe my development of a personal construct model of menopause, consisting of two major meanings of menopause, and five patterns of construing, including a pattern for intervention. I also describe two studies. Study 1 was an exploration of the meanings that women used in construing their expectation and experience of menopause. I identify the themes in the women&#65533;s construing. The most frequently occurring were awareness of physical or psychological change, expressions of distressing emotion, and an inability to predict what was happening. Women also spoke of a lack of opportunities for discussion, and their difficulty in decision-making in this context. These themes made clear the need for an intervention. Study 2 consisted of the development and evaluation of a three-session Menopause Workshop, designed to facilitate women&#65533;s reconstruing of themselves in relation to menopausal changes. The overall aims of this study were: (1) to reduce the women&#65533;s anxiety and feelings of helplessness in relation to menopause, and (2) to increase the women&#65533;s feelings of control, hope and positive feelings in relation to menopause. I conducted an outcome study using a repeated measures, contrast group design. I used content analysis scales to assess the level of emotion reflected in women&#65533;s construing about menopause at three data collection times: pre-workshop, post-workshop, and after five months. At the first data collection the women were screened using a measure of distress, and women with scores above the norm were assigned to Sample A (Above average), and women with scores within the normal range were assigned to Sample B (Normal). A further Contrast Sample (Sample C) was formed of women who took part only in data collections. For the women in Sample A there was a statistically significant long term decrease in anxiety (p = .01), and a long-term decrease in feelings of helplessness that approached significance (p = .26). Although there was a significant improvement in the positive emotions after the workshop, this was not sustained after five months. In an unexpected result, the results for the women in Sample B also showed a statistically significant long-term decrease in anxiety and feelings of helplessness (p = .01). Scores for the Contrast Sample showed no significant difference over time. Aim 1 was met: the women&#65533;s meanings of menopause showed a long-term reduction in feelings of anxiety and helplessness after the very brief personal construct workshop. Aim 2, however, was met in the short term, but not in the longer term. I illustrate these results with case studies, and descriptions of the processes of the workshops. I reflect upon the implications of the findings, comment on the limitations of this research, suggest revision of the personal construct model of menopause, and provide directions for future research. The results of these studies provide further evidence that a personal construct approach can play a convincing role in meeting the growing need for effective provision of time-limited psychological services.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On diversity improvements for ultra wideband communication systems</field><field name="creator">Popovski, Keni</field><field name="description">The wireless communications arena consists of a wide range of products and services, each with a specific target market and approach. Having characteristic advantages and disadvantages, all attempt to increase their market share through diversification and innovation. Ultra wideband (UWB) is a recent entry into the commercial short-range communications world, differentiated by its sparse spectral profile and low peak power emissions. Being unlicensed and capable of operating simultaneously with conventional communication systems, it has seen considerable attention by both industry and academia.This thesis explores diversification improvements available for UWB systems, explicitly through orthogonal user multiplexing schemes, channel equalization, and forward error correction. A review of this communication method is presented, considering its technical evolution and standardization.Multi-user sequencing is researched with regard to a time hopped UWB architecture. The successful adoption of UWB into commercial devices greatly depends upon the development of efficient user access mechanisms. A comparative analysis of varied time, frequency, and direct sequence hopping codes is presented in terms of their performance, diversity, and computational requirements. It is shown that for low user utilization levels, short periodicity deterministic codes attain a similar performance to randomly generated sequences. However, within a fully utilized system deterministic codes slightly out-perform short length random sequences.The application of multiplexing codes to UWB chip level interleaving is also examined. Interleaver performance is compared when designed through long length random codes versus design through deterministic hopping sequences, exemplifying similarities between the approaches.A unique approach to sequence analysis is introduced, developing a set of state probabilities for pulse separations generated by each multiplexing code. Providing insight into optimal code design procedures, this separation profile is employed in the closed-form derivation of intersymbol and multi-user interference expressions. These formulations adopt a transmitter-side equalization process, with comparisons against a receiver-side approach presented. Derivations are based upon an analysis of transmission overlaps, together with the probabilities of each overlap. A close alignment against a simulated UWB system is evident for varied system parameters, exemplifying numerous properties of each equalization measure.Despite diversification efforts to improve communication procedures, data errors are an unavoidable consequence of operation across a wireless medium. Forward error correction is researched within this dissertation for both binary and a non-binary encoding. Utilizing a transmitter-side equalization scheme, conventional binary turbo decoding is considered at the binary data level. Also, non-binary turbo decoding is applied to combine data encoding and user multiplexing stages. This latter method presents an innovative means of time hopping code generation. A comparative analysis of each technique against a simulated performance is given for both single- and multi-user scenarios, together with observations on the multi-user interference effects of signals employing forward error correction. A performance improvement for scarcely populated systems was evident, although a binary turbo scheme is shown to achieve optimal performance in high traffic systems. The mapping scheme required for non-binary encoding is evaluated in terms of random generation and design through deterministic coding schemes. Truncated orthogonal codes are shown to achieve a performance gain for higher turbo iteration levels, also having the advantage of simpler design.Wireless communications are inherently subject to numerous signal degradations. With its revolutionary and unlicensed communication approach, UWB has emerged as a formidable contender in the wireless arena. Having an array of error mitigation techniques, including orthogonal user multiplexing, channel equalization, and advanced error correction, it prevails as a high rate and low power consuming system for the modern world of telecommunications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solitary wave interaction and evolution</field><field name="creator">Hoseini, Sayed Mohammad</field><field name="description">Asymptotic theory is applied to examine solitary wave interaction for three higher-order model equations, which represent small perturbations to integrable equations. The higher-order equations considered are the higher-order Nonlinear Schr&#65533;dinger equation and the focusing and defocusing higher-order Hirota equations. The asymptotic theory, which involves a transformation, allows the straightforward determination of parameter choices, for which the higher-order equations are asymptotically integrable, and of the higher-order phase and coordinate shifts due to the collision, in the asymptotically integrable cases. For the higher-order Hirota equations, direct soliton perturbation theory is also used, to determine the details of the evolving solitary waves; in particular analytical expressions are found for the solitary wave tails. An important feature of the asymptotic and perturbation theories is that they allow cross-validation of the theoretical results and also allow families of asymptotic embedded solitons to be identified. Numerical solutions of the governing equations are also obtained. For solitary wave interaction, asymptotically elastic and inelastic cases are considered. When the higher-order coefficients satisfy the appropriate algebraic relationship then the numerical results confirm the prediction of the asymptotic theory. Numerical solutions for evolving solitary waves are also used to confirm the results of the soliton perturbation theory.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opportunity lost: NSW regional theatre companies 1976 to 2003</field><field name="creator">Davis, Desmond</field><field name="description">From 1976 to 1980 six professional theatre companies were established in NSW outside the capital city Sydney. They were titled Regional Theatre Companies after similar entities in Britain. They grew and flourished into the early 1990s. Then one by one, almost at the height of their activity they began to fail. By 2006 there was only one fully professional regional theatre company operating in NSW.This is the phenomenon which is the subject of this thesis. What distinguished these companies as a group, what did they contribute to regional and national life, how did they arise, what did they achieve and why and how did they decline? The overarching question is of their significance in Australian cultural life and the significance of their failure. Was it an &#8220;opportunity lost&#8221;? These questions have not been systematically addressed in any study and the purpose of this thesis in addressing these issues is to contribute to and invigorate the public debate on the nature of the national theatre enterprise. The six companies for examination are Hunter Valley Theatre Company in Newcastle, Q Theatre in Penrith, Riverina Theatre Company in Wagga Wagga, New England Theatre Company in Armidale, Murray River Performing Group (MRPG) in Albury/Wodonga and Theatre South in Wollongong.  The researcher himself was a participant observer in this story as co-founder and Artistic Director of one of the companies. The methodology for the study is therefore an interpretive and reflexive one. Qualitative, interpretive and reflexive research allows for complexities and enables the researcher to explore multiple possibilities and to place him or herself more visibly in the story, aiming always for interpretation rather than the representation of the apparent reality.Pierre Bourdieu defined theory as a temporary construct which takes shape for and by empirical work. Bourdieu&#8217;s own theories provide an appropriate theoretical framework for this study. Regional Theatre Companies are studied as a distinct agent or sub-field within the larger Field of Cultural Production. Competition of agents within a field is an invariant property of Bourdieu&#8217;s Fields and will determine the dominant and dominated classes within the field. The competition within the Field of Cultural Production is for cultural capital, which in turn will determine who can impose the legitimate definition of art in each particular position including theatre. The dominant class so determined will achieve a position, albeit a dominated one, within the Field of Power in which the struggle is for political and economic capital. The thesis will demonstrate how the major performance companies became the dominant agents in the Field of Cultural Production. This competition for cultural capital takes place in what the thesis identifies as sites of struggle. Among these most relevant for regional theatre are excellence versus access, mainstream versus alternative, elite versus popular, metropolitan versus regional, and global/national versus local/community. The dominant class will be in the former of these dichotomies and the regional theatre companies will be found in the latter.There are two visions of an Australian national theatre: one is a vision of an infrastructure of companies in city and country creating a body of work reflecting and expressing the pluralist identity of Australian culture; the other is a vision of major enterprises in major cities creating work of &#8220;excellence&#8221; and presenting an image of Australian cultural life internationally. The regional theatre companies of NSW had the capacity to be a significant part of the former vision.They found new audience for the theatre, and they found it not only with the traditional repertoire but also with work that was especially relevant for the diverse strands of the regional population, and still further with work which expressed, validated, celebrated and constructed a regional cultural identity. Their work was presented in a style and an environment suited to the nature of their audience and justifiably described as popular. They made mistakes, and often floundered and lost direction, and it would be an exaggeration to claim that they consciously pursued or completely achieved these objectives. Their story is not of an undeniable achievement but of an opportunity lost.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/84</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thermodynamical perspective on organisations: their structure and evolution</field><field name="creator">Sundarasaradula, Doy</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to generate a better understanding and an insightful explanation of the nature and characteristics of organisational structure and evolution through the synthesis of thermodynamics and traditional organisational theories. As living systems, formal organisations need specific energy fluxes not only for their existence, but also for change and evolution, which are the key features that enable them to survive and prosper.The synthesis of thermodynamics and traditional organisational theories can be actualised through the application of the theory of dissipative structures and the theory of self-organisation both of which are based upon non-equilibrium thermodynamics. According to these theories, energy flowing through the systems can create temporal order and organisation as well as changes within these systems provided that their logical structure is autocatalytic.In this thesis, a system dynamics model, which is based upon two hypothetical organisation archetypes with different logical autocatalytic structure, has been developed. The model is used as a platform for simulation experiments in different scenarios with different assumptions. The experiment results suggest following findings:&#8226; Organisations can be understood as interrelated cycles of activities that manifest themselves as sinuous movements or oscillations. These wavy motions are interpreted as an organisation&#8217;s temporal structure.&#8226; An organisation&#8217;s living state, represented by its oscillating activity, depends on a proper combination of resource availability without which this state is not achievable.&#8226; The openness attributed to organisations allows them to influence and be influenced by their environment.&#8226; Organisations with different logical structure behave or response differently to the same environment.&#8226; Organisations adapt to a change in their environment by increasing activity or scale of operation in an environment in which resources are increasing and vice versa.&#8226; Changes in organisations in a complex environment are characterised by discontinuities and chaos. Note that this finding is contradictory to the traditional organisation theories as far as discontinuity is concerned.This research confirms the validity of thermodynamics in clarifying and explaining subtleties inherent in organisational phenomena. The findings thus contribute to the body of knowledge concerning the nature and characteristics of organisational structure and evolution.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and numerical modelling of soft clay foundation improvement via prefabricated vertical drains and vacuum preloading</field><field name="creator">Rujikiatkamjorn, Cholachat</field><field name="description">A system of vertical drains combined with vacuum preloading to accelerate soil consolidation by promoting radial flow is an affective method. In this thesis the analytical modelling of vertical drains incorporating vacuum preloading in an axisymmetric condition is proposed. The distribution of vacuum pressure along the drain and variations in volume compressibility, and permeability of soil based on large scale laboratory observations are included in the proposed solutions. These analytical predictions are compared with the experimental results using a large-scale consolidation chamber and agree with the measured data. In order to conduct a multi-drain, plane strain analysis using numerical modelling, the method of transforming permeability and vacuum pressure between axisymmetric and equivalent plane strain conditions are described through analytical and numerical schemes. After this a multi-drain, plane strain analysis is used to study 4 case histories taken from Thailand and China where the entire embankment was stabilised with vertical drains and subjected to vacuum preloading. This analysis employing the writer&#8217;s model indicates an improvement in the predictions in relation to the field observations. The data show that the efficiency of the prefabricated vertical drains depends on the magnitude and distribution of vacuum pressure, and the extent to which air is prevented from leaking.The design procedures for single stage and multi-stage construction proposed are based on the research knowledge learned from laboratory and field nvestigations. The length of vertical drain, anisotropic soil permeability and vacuum pressure are considered, and a reduction in consolidation time through vacuum preloading is compared to other available methods. Design charts are then developed using the equivalent drain diameter as an independent variable to obtain the relevant drain spacing, and eliminate cumbersome iterative procedures. The design methodologies and examples for single stage and multi-staged construction are also provided.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seedling establishment in an pyrogenic flowering species: the role of time-since-fire, litter and post-dispersal seed predation</field><field name="creator">Denham, Andrew J</field><field name="description">In fire prone environments, the period immediately following fire events is perceived to provide the only opportunity for recruitment for many plant species. Resprouting shrubs do not need to recruit after every fire, because many individuals survive each fire and therefore may contribute to the population. However, without periodic recruitment, the accumulated mortality of adults both during and between fires would lead to local extinction even of these species. Most plant species establish seedlings within a year of fire from either canopy or soil seed banks. In contrast, species with pyrogenic flowering have no seeds available immediately after fire and thus have their recruitment delayed. The work of this thesis aims broadly to investigate the mechanisms by which species with delayed recruitment persist. For one of these species, Telopea speciosissima, I asked the following questions - - Do seedlings establish under shade and litter and tolerate competition from existing plants, or must they establish in open spaces? - Does post-dispersal seed predation strongly influence seedling recruitment or are its seeds less susceptible to predation than those of early post-fire recruiters? and - Does T. speciosissima have particular characteristics that tie seedling establishment to the late post-fire environment or is it only its life history (constrained by its phylogeny) that prevents earlier seed release? Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic flowering species - it has no seed bank, but it resprouts, flowers and sets fruit in the post-fire environment. I examined recruitment in T. speciosissima using two seed-addition experiments, in which I manipulated predator access, microhabitat characteristics, and time of seed arrival in relation to fire. For contrast, I included Banksia serrata, a resprouting canopy seed bank species with seed mass similar to in T. speciosissima, in one of these experiments. In the first experiment (in sites that were 3 and 4 years post-fire), seed predation was measured by placing caches of seeds within experimental microsites. These microsites were left open or covered with 12mm mesh to exclude vertebrates. The habitat within the experimental microsites was classified according to litter and vegetation cover. It was then either left intact or the litter and vegetation were removed. Seed predation was high overall (47-80%), regardless of access to vertebrates. Predation varied among sites. Few seeds or seedlings survived to 9 months after planting. Survival xii of seeds or seedlings was improved in microsites with dense vegetation and litter cover. Removing the litter and vegetation cover increased the probability of seed predation by vertebrates in the first year of the experiment, but it did not influence predation by invertebrates. In the second experiment (in sites that were 0.5 and 2-3 years post-fire), vertebrate predators were excluded from all experimental microsites. Vegetation within experimental microsites was not modified, but the litter was modified such that half the microsites had the mean mass of the early post-fire sites, the other half the mean mass of the later post-fire sites. Here I compared seedling establishment of T. speciosissima with that of the canopy seed bank species, B. serrata. I hypothesised that seedling establishment would be linked to the timing of seed release determined by the natural history of the species, with the prediction that B. serrata would establish more seedlings soon after fire, while T. speciosissima would establish more seedlings later after fire. The litter treatment tested the hypothesis that litter mass made a significant contribution to differences between the habitats with different times since fire. Seedling establishment overall was poor (&lt; 36% of seeds), peaking within 3 months of planting. Both species established more seedlings in late post-fire sites, but litter treatments did not influence seed survival or seedling establishment. Seeds of T. speciosissima suffered greater predation in early post-fire sites (69.5%) than in late post-fire sites (51.2%). Predation of B. serrata was lower and did not vary significantly among sites (47.3%). Since the canopy seed bank species (B. serrata) may establish seedlings in early or late post-fire habitats, its recruitment opportunities are determined by the timing of seed release after fire. In contrast, the greater susceptibility of T. speciosissima to seed predation in early post-fire sites suggests that this may be a factor favouring delayed seed release. This provides support for the hypothesis that T. speciosissima, as a pyrogenic flowering species, has characteristics that favour late post-fire recruitment. The seeds and seedlings of both these species tolerate relatively high levels of vegetation and litter cover. However, for pyrogenic flowering species, effective postfire recruitment may require the coincidence of favourable environmental conditions and low levels of seed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency gains for seasonal adjustment by joint modelling of disaggregated series</field><field name="creator">Birrell, Carole</field><field name="description">Governments and businesses use data collected over time as indicators of the social, economic and business conditions of the country.  These may then be used for policy and planning decisions, calculation of national accounts and monitoring of economic activity.  The production and publication of seasonally adjusted series, in addition to unadjusted figures, is standard practice for government statistical agencies.  In general, there are two main approaches to seasonal adjustment, namely a filter-based approach and a model-based approach.  Filter-based methods estimate time series components, such as the trend and seasonal factors, by application of a set of filters to the original series.  Model-based methods of seasonal adjustment are more specific to each series, and are thereby more flexible.Time series resulting from aggregation of several sub-series can be seasonally adjusted directly or indirectly.  With model-based seasonal adjustment, the sub-series may also be considered as a multivariate system of series and hence the analysis may be done jointly.  This approach has considerable advantage over the indirect method, as it utilises the covariance structure between the sub-series.The focus of this thesis is on examining how the accuracy of seasonally adjusted series can be improved by using the sub-series.  A model-based approach to seasonally adjusting an aggregated series is carried out with two different methods.  The first method utilises a univariate basic structural model (BSM) for the aggregated series.  The second method utilises a multivariate basic structural model for the sub-series.  In basic structural models, the series components are modelled individually, and then put into state space form.  The Kalman filter is applied to obtain estimates of the aggregated series components and the prediction mean squared errors.  The variance of the seasonally adjusted series given by the two methods is studied through their relative efficiency.  A particular emphasis of the thesis is on how the similarity of and differences between disaggregated series affect the efficiency of the two approaches to seasonal adjustment. Results indicate that gains are attainable under specified conditions which rely on the values of the parameters of not only the seasonal component, but also the non-seasonal components.  These results demonstrate the impact on relative efficiency of relationships among sub-series parameters, both between series (i.e. within components) and within series (i.e. between components).The impact of the length of the time series on the accuracy of seasonally adjusted series is of particular interest.  A simulation study investigates the parameter estimates obtained given varying series lengths and the subsequent effects on the accuracy of the time series components given by the Kalman filter.  These effects are measured by the naive bias in the prediction mean squared error and by the revision error.  A bootstrap correction is applied to the estimated prediction mean squared error for both the univariate and multivariate approaches.A single indicator measure is developed for predicting whether the properties of the disaggregated series (or sub-series) will lead to gains in the accuracy of the seasonally adjusted aggregated series.  The quasi-likelihood method is applied to obtain the indicator measure of relative efficiency.  It is shown to be directly related to the relative efficiency measure obtained with the Kalman filter.Another application of the quasi-likelihood indicator is in identifying an appropriate grouping of the K sub-series into r &lt; K series.  The grouping can considerably reduce the number of estimated parameters, while the accuracy of the seasonally adjusted series is maintained.The integrated approach of this thesis to the seasonal adjustment of aggregated series thus provides a pathway to improved efficiency and an understanding of the conditions under which improvements may be achieved.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The silence of the void: exploring the visual language of the void from the east and the west</field><field name="creator">Sun, Chien-Yu</field><field name="description">This study investigates the visual language embodied in the idea of the void in the creation of works of visual art. Through the exploration of ancient Chinese ink painting such as literati painting and Chan (Zen) ink painting (Kao: 1992, Zong: 1981), western geometrical abstract painting of the early twentieth century (Harrison and Wood: 1992, Malevich: 1968), and the abstract paintings of contemporary Taiwanese artists, such as Hsiao Chin, Liu Ku-Sung and Lo Jui-lin (Hsiao: 1991, Yip: 1987) the research examines the representative meaning of the void and its visual characteristics in different eras and cultures. The energy of the void as it is manifest in various forms of art is explored in both theoretical and creative research. This study includes ancient Chinese ink painting that explored how the ideas of Taoist chi and the emptiness of Chan (Zen) were embodied in the expression of brushstroke, colour and space and brought a profound and simple visual language to Chinese art. The discussion illustrates how western geometrical abstract painting of the early twentieth century, especially Suprematism, constructed significant new forms that revolved around the idea of the void. A combination of eastern philosophy concerning the void and the expressive methods of western abstraction is embodied in contemporary Taiwanese art and has become the vehicle in the exploration of the self. This is also the main concern in my digital creations. My creative work introduces an artform of abstract sublimation. Its characteristics of simplicity and tranquillity convey understanding gained from nature and cultural awareness. The void in my work is used to enhance the importance of introspection, combined with modern technology. Through the process of meditating in the medium of the computer, the artforms evoked by the void have produced a new visual language that presents an intuitive and spontaneous inner imagery. This work articulates a tranquil and harmonious aesthetic, related to a long visual tradition that has emerged as a consequence of art processes linked to the purification of mind.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of the starting boron powder on the superconducting properties of MgB</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xun</field><field name="description">The effect of the properties of the starting boron powders on the superconducting properties of MgB2 has been studied. Low grade boron powders are attractive because of their low cost, but produced lower surface reactivity and larger particle size than high purity (99%) amorphous boron powder, indicating that the low grade powders cannot be used to achieve the same superconducting properties as those of samples made from pure 99% boron powder. However, the low purity boron powders can be improved by using simple physical and chemical processes, leading to enhanced magnetic critical current density, Jc. In order to get high performance MgB2, it is obviously important to control the phase composition and microstructure of the boron starting powders and the solid state reaction conditions.Ball milling is an effective method to reduce the boron particle size, so, the effects of ball milling boron powders in different media, such as acetone, ethanol, and toluene, on the superconducting properties of MgB2 needed to be considered and studied. It was observed that toluene was the most effective medium of them all for enhancing Jc. Jc was estimated to be 5 &#215; 103 A cm&#8722;2 at 8 T and 5 K for a sample that was ball milled in toluene. This value is much higher than that of the pure MgB2 reference sample that was not ball milled, by a factor of 20. It was considered that ball milling B using toluene leads to smaller MgB2 grains, resulting in enhanced Jc at low operating temperatures and high fields.MgB2 samples were prepared using as-supplied commercial 96% boron with strong crystalline phase and the same 96% boron (B) after ball milling. The effects of the properties of the starting B powder on the superconductivity were evaluated. It was observed that samples using ball-milled 96% B, in comparison with the reference sample made from the as-supplied 96% B, were characterized by small grain size and enhanced magnetic critical current density (Jc), which reached 2 &#215;103 A cm-2 at 5 K and 8 T. The improved pinning seen in these samples seems to be caused by enhanced grain boundary pinning at high field. MgB2 samples were also prepared by using 96% boron powder with strong crystalline phase that had been ball milled for various times. Based on Rowell connectivity analysis, when the ball-milling time increased, the connectivity factor, described as the active cross-sectional area fraction (AF), was decreased. This implies that the inter-grain connectivity became worse. These properties could lead to poor Jc in low field. However, the pinning force strength of samples using ball-milled 96% B is larger than that of the reference sample using as-supplied commercial 96% B powder. These results accompany enhanced irreversibility (Hirr) and upper critical fields (Hc2).Furthermore, the magnetic field dependence of the transport critical current density (Jct) and the grain connectivity of MgB2/Fe wires fabricated from ball-milled boron have been investigated in detail, and strong correlations have been found, as evidenced by differences in grain size, critical transition temperature, and resistivity. It was observed that the samples fabricated by ball milling had relatively small grain sizes, resulting in a weaker field dependence of the Jct in the high field region. On the other hand, the ballmilled boron was associated with poor connectivity between adjacent grains. It is clearly shown that the observed reduction in low field Jct is related to the reduction in the superconducting area fraction that is reflected by the connectivity factor. Even though high temperature sintering could always compensate for the degradation of the Jct in the low field region, the subsequent grain growth in this case was mainly responsible for the degradation of Jct in the high field region. The strong correlation between the grain size and the connectivity can change the field dependence of the Jct, and both these factors are primarily affected by the sintering temperature and by the presence and extent of ball milling.In the MgB2 field, chemical doping is the most popular way to improve the superconductor properties. It has been reported that significantly enhanced critical current density in MgB2 superconductor could be easily obtained by doping with a hydrocarbon, highly active pyrene (C16H10), while using a sintering temperature as low as 600oC. The processing advantages of the C16H10 additive include production of a highly active carbon (C) source, an increased level of disorder, and the introduction of small grain size, resulting in  enhancement of Jc.Using the same concept, low purity boron powders were used to fabricate pure and submicron-sized carbon sphere doped MgB2 superconductor. The boron powders used showed low reactivity towards MgB2 formation, as compared to high purity (99%) amorphous boron, which might result from the larger grain size and the existence of crystalline boron or boron oxide in the former. However, the samples prepared from this boron powder showed comparable Jc values at 20 K and in low field (&lt;1 T) to those from a sample prepared from 99% amorphous boron. Doping submicron-sized carbon spheres successfully introduced carbon substitution for boron, and so improved the Hc2, Hirr, and in-field Jc properties of the MgB2.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical appraisal of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia including comparative issues and lesson learnts [sic] from Australia</field><field name="creator">Rudiyanto, Arifin</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts an interdisciplinary approach. It examines the development of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia and explores how well Indonesia is governing its marine and coastal space and resources and with what effects and consequences. This thesis uses a policy analysis framework, with legislative and institutional activity as the basic unit of analysis. Three factors are identified as having been the major influences on the evolution of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia. These are international law, marine science and &#8220;state of the art&#8221; marine and coastal management. The role of these factors in the management of the coastal zone, living and non-living marine resources, marine science and technology, the marine environment and relevant international relations are analysed and discussed in the Indonesian case. This thesis concludes that Indonesia&#8217;s major challenges in terms of sustainable marine and coastal development are (a) to establish an appropriate management regime, and (b) to formulate and implement a combination of measures in order to attain the objectives of sustainable development. The basic problem is the fact that currently, Indonesia is not a &#8220;marine oriented&#8221; nation. Therefore, marine and coastal affairs are not at the top of the public policy agenda. Principles of international instruments have influenced the establishment of marine and coastal policy and management in Indonesia. However, in the implementation of sound management practices, Indonesia faces many challenges. The distinctive characteristics of Indonesia as an archipelagic nation underpin the basic philosophy of marine and coastal policy and management. With the increasing priority of marine and coastal policy in national development, science and environmental aspects have been able to play a greater role in policy development. ii A number of lessons can be taken from the Australian experience that may have some relevance to how Indonesia meets the challenges of implementing its new marine and coastal policy. For example, Indonesia needs to follow the lead of Australia, establishing national principles, goals and objectives for the sustainable of Indonesia&#8217;s marine and coastal resources and the conservation, protection and restoration of the marine and coastal environment. The solution for major marine and coastal management problems between federal and states, such as Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) and Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE), offer an attractive alternative for the implementation of regional autonomy in Indonesia. Also, there is a need for multi-stakeholder involvement throughout the policy development process. In readiness for the 21st Century, the Guidelines of State Policy (GBHN) 1999 stated a shift of paradigm from &#8216;terrestrial oriented&#8217; towards &#8216;marine oriented&#8217; development. Indonesia started to give more priority to marine and coastal development and now faces the challenges posed by the transition from issue analysis and planning to the implementation of policies. One way or the other, it is reasonable to conclude that new forces and new needs are likely to bring change and improvement to marine and coastal governance in Indonesia over the next decade or so. iii</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of poly(thiophene)s</field><field name="creator">Tsekouras, George</field><field name="description">The utilisation of conducting polymers for photovoltaic applications represents the possibility of low-cost production of solar electricity.

These precursors included a C60-substituted terthiophene derivative, 3-alkylthiophenes and ethersubstituted terthiophenes. Polymers synthesised from 3-alkylthiophene derivatives were also blended with a soluble C60 derivative to give composite films. Terthiophene itself was used to prepare photoelectrochemical cells based on poly(terthiophene). The effects of the conditions used to electrochemically grow poly(terthiophene), such as solvent, electropolymerisation technique and electropolymerisation temperature, were investigated. In addition, the incorporation of commercially available anionic dyes and cationic dyes into poly(terthiophene) during electropolymerisation and post-growth electrochemical reduction, respectively, was considered.The investigations made in this study may be classified according to one of the following strategies for improving the photovoltaic efficiency of photoelectrochemical cells based on poly(thiophene)s: controlling polymer morphology, enhancing light absorption, improving exciton dissociation or increasing the efficiency of electron transfer at the interface between the photoactive layer and liquid electrolyte. In this way the investigations in this study were all targeted at improving a particular aspect of the photovoltaic effect in photoelectrochemical cells.In addition to the characterisation of the photovoltaic properties of the photoactive materials prepared, such materials were also characterised using techniques that included post-growth cyclic voltammetry, UV-Vis spectroscopy, photocurrent action spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and in situ spectroelectrochemistry. The results obtained from such characterisations gave an insight into the photovoltaic properties observed, in addition to general information on the properties of the photoactive materials investigated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The silence and fantasy of women and work</field><field name="creator">Crinis, Vicki Denese</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the discursive representation of working-class women and work in the development of the Malay Peninsula during the colonial and post-colonial periods. It questions the selective appearance of womens labour in official records, and traces representations of women and work in the colonial discourses of the 1900s through to those that supported Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamads vision for a modern Malaysia in order to analyse the continuities and discontinuities in Malaysian concepts about women and work. My research reveals that in the colonial period women were engaged in many types of waged work in the Federated Malay States, but only sex workers receive more than peripheral attention in archival documents. The societal positioning of women within the family context as wives, daughters and mothers served to deny womens status and identity as worker. However, womens socially accepted roles did not prevent them from being represented in anthropological and fictional texts of the period as part of the orientalist discourse of the exotic other. I argue in this study that this complex positioning of colonised women denied them a sense of identity as workers. The reality of womens lives continued to be obscured through the conflation of cultural structures, market forces, and national development after Independence. As a result of the post-colonial government&#65533;s drive to transform Malay agricultural workers into urban workers, large numbers of Malay women joined the blue-collar workforce. In the 1970s Malay women from the kampongs were celebrated as factory workers and emphasis was placed on their docile nature and nimble fingers; their skills and docility were used to sell Malaysia as a site for footloose manufacturing. Yet, more recently, female factory workers have been increasingly ignored in official discourse. The nimble-fingered, unskilled female worker has been replaced by the professional woman worker and the (implicitly male) knowledge worker in discourses of Malaysias successful industrialisation. This shift reinforced gendered stereotypes of work and workers - rather than dissipating them - by bringing with it the return of a shroud of invisibility, reminiscent of the colonial period, over working-class women&#65533;s work. These gendered stereotypes of work have been reinforced by other discursive frames concerning their sexuality which resonate with colonial discourses about the female worker. Within these discourses, working-class womens work efforts have continued to be undermined by the emphasis placed on womens sexuality and reproduction.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-image query content-based image retrieval</field><field name="creator">Ren, Feng H</field><field name="description">Content-based retrieval is based on the premise that the similarity measures in the feature space accord well with visual perceptual similarity. Furthermore, the queryby-example paradigm assumes that the query concept is well specified by the user via the example image supplied. The inadequacy of these assumptions has led to the development of several similarity measures and visual features that capture and describe colour, texture and edge information in images. The simultaneous use of multiple features, relevance feedback and more recently and the use of multiple example images in specifying the query are attempts to improve the accuracy at which the query concept can be captured. Results obtained so far are still far from the ideal because of inadequate knowledge of the human perceptual processes and this leads to the so called &#8221;Semantic Gap&#8221;. This thesis proposes a multi-image query-by-example content-based image retrieval scheme in which the significance of the components of feature vectors (intra-level) and the significance of the selected features (inter-level) are estimated through weight computation. These weights are used in calculating the feature distances and visual similarity between the query images and the database images. The hypothesis is that by incorporating the significance of features at both levels, the weighted visual similarity measure will yield improved retrieval performance (precision and recall rates). The model of the weight estimation and assignment is developed and experiments are conducted to validate the hypothesis. On average the proposed method improved the precision and recall rates in retrieval tasks on a database of natural images.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reputation system for BitTorrent peer-to-peer file-sharing networks</field><field name="creator">Yu, Lan</field><field name="description">Over the past few years, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have grown extensively and dramatically changed large-scale file transfer. One of the most popular P2P network is the BitTorrent system. BitTorrent can efficiently distribute large files by optimizing the use of network bandwidth and providing scalability. Due to the open and anonymous nature of P2P systems BitTorrent also provides an ideal environment for distribution of malicious, low quality, or doctored information. A number of reputation systems, including P2PRep with its successors XRep and X2Rep, had been proposed to address security weaknesses of Gnutella P2P file sharing networks. Although it has been claimed that these methods are also applicable to the other file sharing networks, it is not clear how to achieve this task. Moreover, some of the shortcomings of these reputation systems such as online-polling only and cold-start may be exploited by malicious attackers. In this paper, we propose a reputation system, called X2BTRep, which is an extension of the X2Rep and for BitTorrent network. We show that the proposed system improves the security and the quality of information distributed over P2P networks.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The power of the extractive industries: capturing the international accounting standard setting process</field><field name="creator">Cortese, Corinne L</field><field name="description">Purpose - This thesis examines the role of power in the international accounting standard setting process for the extractive industries and explains how that process was mobilised by key extractive industries constituents. For many years these constituents, highly significant in the global economy, have enjoyed choice in the application of accounting standards, enabling them flexibility in the way they present their operations. This investigation illuminates the way in which they have influenced the process of setting an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for the extractive industries. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on a critical approach to accounting research, termed critical investigative inquiry. This methodology focuses on the political, economic, and social influences on accounting and facilitates the questioning of taken for granted assumptions and power relations involved in accounting and accounting standard setting. The research method that is used to conduct these inquiries is based on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). CDA is used to identify the key players involved in the international accounting standard setting process for the extractive industries, and to analyse their discourse and its implications. The outcomes of the international accounting standard setting process are then explained using power/capture theory, which was developed for this research as an integration of Lukes' (1974) conception of power and Mitnick's (1980) theory of regulatory capture. Lukes' (1974) theory recognises that power need not be empirically verifiable to exist and that the status quo may need to be questioned in order for the presence of power to be illuminated. Mitnick's (1980) theory explains regulatory processes and identifies the factors that contribute to a predisposition of regulatory bodies to take actions consistent with the preferences of the industry they were intended to regulate. Power/capture theory, in combination with CDA, provides a framework to make possible the exposure of these factors and recognises that the presence of power/capture may be insidious and the result of a relationship formed between the regulatory body and the regulated industry. Findings - The IASC/IASB's extractive industries project, commenced in 1998, resulted in the issue in December 2004 of IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets. This IFRS is simply a codification of existing industry practice, resulting in a perpetuation of the disparate accounting and financial reporting endemic to the extractive industries. This has occurred because of the mobilisation of a powerful community of interests within the extractive industries, which has enabled them to capture the IASC/IASB in order to maintain status quo of flexibility in accounting and financial reporting. Research contributions - The contributions of this research are three-fold. First, as a critical methodology and research method, critical investigative inquiry and CDA have the potential not only to uncover the social practice and public discourse of accounting standard setting, but also to expose the discourse practice underlying the process and make visible the presence of power. Secondly, the theory of power/capture developed to explain the international accounting standard setting process is an innovative approach developed from two theories which are themselves relatively absent from extant accounting literature. Further, CDA and power/capture theory are complementary, and may be used together as a comprehensive framework for critical examination of the accounting standard setting process. Thirdly, this research provides a contribution to practical knowledge of international accounting standard setting processes by tracing the history of accounting for the extractive industries, identifying key players involved in the process, and making connections between these players to provide confirmatory evidence of the effect of power in the international accounting standard setting process. Research limitations/future research - Because this research is based on publicly available information and identification of key players based on lobbying activity, it relies on overt behaviour that may occur relatively late in the process of setting the accounting standard, compared to agenda setting and committee formation. Further studies may overcome this limitation by examining international accounting standard setting from inside the process, by means of participant observation. The CDA and power/capture framework developed in this thesis can be applied to other studies of international accounting standard setting projects or to studies of other aspects of the extractive industries project.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interchanging influences on the road: reflection on Jewish textiles</field><field name="creator">Price, Noa</field><field name="description">As a textile designer, my research examines designs and embellishments on the every day and sacred objects of Jewish migration.

Gede Pramudya</field><field name="description">Researchers report that learners find the flexibility of hypermedia learning systems both a strength and a weakness. On the one hand hypermedia learning systems allow learners to work at their own pace and allow a great deal of control of the learning paths they take. For some learners this is a blessing, but others feel overwhelmed by the large number of available options and suffer from information overload. One approach to this problem is to provide learners with an adaptive learning system that initially limits the choices they can make until they have mastered key concepts. The system analyses learner responses and once key concepts have been mastered, learners are allowed increased access to a greater range of learning materials and options. During this study a Web-based authoring tool called ART-WEB 3.9 was used to develop a prototype of an adaptive Web-based environment. The purpose of the prototype was to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a conceptual and procedural introduction to the multimedia author tool HyperStudio(superscript TM). This prototype was trialled with 2 undergraduate and 1 graduate class. Data were collected by questionnaires, interviews and tracking files of learner use. Coded data were entered into a spreadsheet and then analysed. The findings showed that the use of adaptive annotation technology as found in authoring tools like ART-WEB 3.9 supported student learning of basic conceptual and procedural knowledge about the use of the authoring tool HyperStudio(superscript TM). The data suggest that the system provided learners with a well-structured navigation system that made use of textual and visual cues to locate them in hyperspace and to provided feedback on their progress. This supports the findings of other researchers who used tools in other contexts. This study contributes to the research literature by showing that Web-based adaptive learning environments may have a role to play in supporting the development of learner conceptual and procedural knowledge when they are involved in learning a complex skill such as the use of multimedia authoring tool. The tool developed was a prototype and as such would need additional development before being put to general use. However, it did demonstrate a concept and show that such tools may be useful supports in complex, hypermedia learning environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contemporary workplace and its influence on individualised and collective social relationships in the public and private spheres</field><field name="creator">Vogl, Gillian J</field><field name="description">Globally, in the last few decades, there have been massive cultural and structural changes in the workplace. These changes that have occurred to the labour process have been complex and varied. However, some general trends can be identified with regard to a neo liberal Australian workplace. This thesis is an exploration of the types of sociality that have arisen due to the present relationship between capital and labour. Through in depth semi-structured interviews with forty-seven people working in middle and working class occupations situated in a range of public and private sector workplaces, this study focuses on workers own interpretations of how cultural and structural practices have impacted on their social relationships in both the public and private spheres. This also involves a discussion of how workers experience and define intimacy and friendship in the first place. My methodological approach was qualitative and situated in a critical social science perspective. I have therefore both theoretically and substantively placed the participants subjective experiences into the macro political and economic context in which they had occurred. I have done this with an awareness that while there have been macro influences on the relationship between capital and labour, this relationship is refined and shaped also by more micro work processes. The subject matter of this thesis was multi-layered and thus involved the generation of an eclectic theoretical framework using a number of sociological theoretical traditions. I have explored both the Sociology of friendship and Organisational Sociology. I have provided a critique of neo liberalism and considered concepts such as fordism and post- fordism. Theoretically I have examined how individualised and collectivised processes operating within the workplace have influenced types of sociality in the public and private spheres. An important part of this thesis involves a teasing out of the relationship between collectivism and individualism. I examine individual and collective processes in the workplaces with regard to human resources, industrial relations and forms of work organisation. Other concepts that I have also used for considering how workplace changes have impacted on types of sociality are hegemony, ideology and class. While a few middle class employees may have benefited from these changes, the reality for most is that these changes have meant the rise of precarious work, resulting in job insecurity, the intensification of work, the undermining of collective forms of solidarity and the increased blurring of the boundaries between home and the workplace. Some have argued that workplace changes resulting in teamwork and the increased reliance on more instrumental relationships, such as networking, have undermined more collective forms of worker generated solidarity and more genuine relationships in peoples working and private lives. Findings from this study suggest that genuine, more collective social relationships did exist but were severely undermined by the neo liberal structural and cultural changes that had occurred in most of the workplaces.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of new benzo[b]thiophene amide-based antimicrobial agents</field><field name="creator">Mbere, Johana M</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this project was to investigate the synthesis and activity of a range of compounds based on the benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide structural motif as potential new antimalarial agents, and to a lesser extent as antibacterial agents.In order to subsequently explore any structure-biological activity relationships, the first part of the project involved the systematic synthesis of some 39 non-fused substituted benzo[b]thiophene amide derivatives including tetrahydroisoquinolines, tetrahydro-&#946;-carbolines, dihydropyrroles, piperazines, piperidines and other bridged ring systems as part of the amide-nitrogen component. Methods for the synthesis of the new amide derivatives were developed based on benzo[b]thiophene acid chloride and amine reactions, or on dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-mediated carboxylic acid amine coupling reactions.Further substitution reactions were also undertaken on tetrahydro-&#946;-carboline amides (55, 56, and 57) with the introduction of an N-benzyl group and an N-onitrobenzyl group in the case of 55. The N-boc protected piperazine amide 63 also served as a precursor for other N-substituted piperazine amide derivatives. A single crystal X-ray structure on amides 63 and 73 confirmed the amide rotamer geometry in the solid state with these compounds.The second part of the project incorporated the synthesis of fused analogues which were more conformationally restricted while still retaining the benzo[b]thiophene amide structural motif. A new free radical cyclisation approach to the benzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-1-one system in compound 92 was developed, together with the corresponding model isoquinolinone analogue 95. The reaction was based on the use of tributyltin hydride and AIBN to produce the required free radical intermediate from an arylbromide precursor.The free radical cyclisation reaction was extended to synthesise N-benzyl and substituted N-benzyl analogues of 92. The dihydroxylation of the N-allyl substituent in 92 was achieved using potassium osmate and N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO). A further free radical cyclisation route to the N-benzo[b]thien-2-oyl derivatives 112 was also achieved.The synthesis of the novel 9-membered ring containing fused derivatives 120 and 121 was also achieved. This synthesis involved ring closing metathesis methodology using the bis-allyl amides 118 and 119 and Grubbs&#8217; I ruthenium catalyst. The polymer supported version of this catalyst gave better yields of the cyclisation products. A single crystal X-ray structure of 120 confirmed the cis geometry of the double bond in the 9-membered ring. In the course of preparing the required precursor 119 for the 9-membered ring synthesis, a new imine allylation reagent combination was discovered involving zinc, allyltributyltin and boron trifluoride etherate. This reaction is worthy of further investigation to determine its wider synthetic utility.Ring closing metathesis reactions also afforded the dihydropyrrole amides 113 and 114 in good yields.A palladium-mediated cyclisation approach to the new benzo[b]thieno[2,3- c]pyrrolo[2,3-a]indol-11-one system in 126 was also accomplished based on the Nacylindoles 124 and 125.A number of the compounds were tested for their possible in vitro antimalarial activity against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum (K1 CB1 and TM4/ 8.2) and two active leads, the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivatives 95 and 102, were discovered. Some potential structure-activity trends for the tested benzo[b]thiophene derivatives were observed (Chapter 4).Antibacterial testing of a few benzo[b]thiophene compounds against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains was also done, and the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivative 92 exhibited promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundary element formulations for fracture mechanics problems</field><field name="creator">Wu, Wei-Liang</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we study the advanced boundary element method for fracture mechanics, including static and dynamic problems. Static problems are solved by using the dual boundary element method, that the dual equations are the displacement and the traction boundary integral equations. An efficient integral equation formulation is proposed with the displacement equation being used on the outer boundary and the traction equation being used on one of the crack faces, which bases on the works in the paper Dual boundary integral formulation for 2-d linear elastic crack problems (Submitted to Journal of Computational Mathematics). Discontinuous quarter point elements are used to correctly model the displacement in the vicinity of crack tips. Using this formulation a general crack problem can be solved in a single-region formulation, and only one of the crack faces needs to be discretised. Once the relative displacements of the cracks are solved numerically, physical quantities of interest, such as crack tip stress intensity factors can be easily obtained. Normally, the stress intensity factor is obtained by using discontinuous quarter point element method. Because quadratic boundary elements do not correctly describe the behaviour of displacement near the crack tips, special crack tip elements are needed to model the displacement in the vicinity of crack tips. In this work, we present a special crack tip element method, which provides similar accuracy as that of quarter point element method, but a much easier discretisation of the crack face for evaluating stress intensity factors. Further, a new subregion boundary element technique is presented to solve composite material problems, which bases on the work in the paper A new subregion boundary element method (Published by 15th International Conference on Boundary Element Technology 2003). Similar composite problems are also solved by using domain decomposition method, which based on the work in the paper A new subregion boundary element technique based on the domain decomposition method (Submitted to Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements). The technique is more efficient than traditional methods because it significantly reduces the size of the final matrix. This is advantageous when a large number of elements need to be used, such as in crack analysis. Also, as the system of equations for each subregion is solved independently, parallel computing can be utilized. Further, if the boundary conditions are changed the only equations required to be recalculated are the ones related to the regions where the changes occur. This is very useful for cases where crack extension is modelled with new boundary elements or where crack faces come to contact. Dynamic fracture mechanics problems are solved by using the dual reciprocity boundary element method, which based on the work in the paper A subregion DBEM formulation for dynamic analysis of two dimensional cracks (Accepted by Mathematical and Computer Modelling). The dual reciprocity boundary element method employing the step by step time integration technique is developed to analyse two-dimensional dynamic crack problems. In this method the equation of motion is expressed in boundary integral form using elastostatic fundamental solutions. In order to transform the domain integral into an equivalent boundary integral, a general radial basis function is used for the derivation of the particular solutions. The dual reciprocity boundary element method is combined with an efficient subregion boundary element method to overcome the difficulty of a singular system of algebraic equations in crack problems. Dynamic stress intensity factors are calculated using the discontinuous quarter point elements.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of flooding in Australian dryland rivers to synoptic weather patterns, El Nino southern oscillation, sea surface temperatures and rainfall distribution</field><field name="creator">Grootemaat, Graham D</field><field name="description">This thesis classifies and describes the synoptic weather patterns resulting in floods, investigates the spatial properties of dryland rainfall, and identifies the links between flooding and flow patterns with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) in Australian dryland rivers catchments. Flooding of dryland rivers in the monsoon dominated northern areas, such as in Timor Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria drainage divisions, is exclusively the result of tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows (monsoon depressions) and tropical cyclones. The Timor Sea division, however, has a larger proportion of floods caused by tropical cyclones (32% of the total) compared to the Gulf of Carpentaria division (7% of the total). In the latter division 80% of the floods are the result of tropical trough/lows and deep tropical lows whereas in the Timor Sea division only 48% of floods are the result of these two synoptic classes. They also cause a high proportion of floods in the Indian Ocean division together with the Gascoyne-Murchison-Greenough region of the central west of Western Australia. Tropical cyclones tend to produce the largest floods in all these divisions. In the more centrally located regions such as the Lake Eyre division, the northeast Murray-Darling Rivers, the Bulloo, Paroo and Warrego Rivers, and the Greenough, Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers, there are many more types of flood-producing weather patterns compared to the monsoon dominated drainage divisions further north. Flooding can result from at least six different synoptic classes individually, including tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows, tropical cyclones, frontal systems and easterly dips (continental and offshore). Twenty-nine percent of floods result from combined synoptic classes with 15 different combinations involving every synoptic class. Tropical trough/lows and easterly dips (continental) are dominant. Easterly dips (continental) are significant flood producing weather patterns in these centrally located regions and tend to occur in the winter months in association with favourable upper atmosphere conditions and strengthening high-pressure systems. In southern areas, such as in the southwest coastal division of Western Australia and the southern Murray-Darling basin, frontal systems and cut-off lows are the dominant flood-producing weather patterns. However, in the latter a larger proportion of floods result from cut-off lows (18%) relative to frontal systems (8%), whilst in the southwest coastal division frontal systems produce a larger proportion of floods (29%) relative to cut-off lows (26%). Cut-off lows were also found to result in a significant number of floods in the Greenough, Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers in central Western Australia. These can often combine with northwest cloudbands in this area, the largest flood on record for the Gascoyne River being the result of such a combination.In contrast to many other dryland regions of the world, rainfall in dryland Australia (both flooding and storm rainfall totals) is relatively widespread and uniform rather than localized and convective. However, rainfall in the arid Todd River region around Alice Springs is slightly less widespread than rainfall in the semi-arid Thomson River region, particularly for smaller storm-rainfall events. It appears that the smaller rainfall events in more arid areas of Australia are the result of more convective, smaller scale weather patterns that lead to more discrete, localized rainfall totals. In comparison, larger rainfall events that produce flooding are the result of synoptic scale weather patterns such as tropical trough/lows, deep tropical lows or ex-tropical cyclones, and tend to result in relatively widespread and uniform rainfall across the region. Only north and northeast Australia show a clear, consistent and predictable relationship between the magnitude of partial series flood events and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) indices, with correlation coefficients modest but reaching 0.40-0.50. The SST1 anomaly (The SST1 anomaly represents the sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean) and the SOI appear to be the most reliable indicators. For seasonal correlations in north and northeast Australia, spring, summer and autumn monthly flows are more highly correlated with the SOI and SSTs, whereas in southern Australia winter and spring monthly flows are more highly correlated. This demonstrates that the specific synoptic weather patterns that cause high seasonal monthly flows are related to the SOI and SSTs. In Western Australia autumn and winter seasonal flows are strongly negatively correlated with Indian Ocean SSTs. These correlations are strongest in the northwest and are related to the Indian Ocean dipole. Over the last 300Ka it has been inferred that the monsoon played a pivotal role during warmer interglacial periods, generating greater runoff throughout much of dryland Australia. Under climate change, where temperatures would be higher, it thought that the monsoon, with its characteristic wet and dry seasons, would affect areas further to the south. Monsoon lows and ex-tropical cyclones would more frequently affect southern areas, whilst mid-latitude weather patterns, such as frontal systems and cut-off lows, would only seriously affect the very southern areas. Further to this the more central dryland regions, such as the northern Murray-Darling Rivers, that currently receive flooding through a large range of weather patterns, would probably become dominated by tropical systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Piracy protection in content distribution systems</field><field name="creator">Tonien, Dongvu</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we consider the traitor tracing problem. We study codes with different traceability properties and public key traitor tracing schemes. We study maximal codes with 2-identifiable parent property. Using graph theoretic techniques, we determine the structure of the graph representation of maximal codes of length three having 2-identifiable parent property, and derive the number of codewords in such codes. Maximal 2-identifiable parent property codes of length four have recently been studied. It is still an open problem to determine the size and structure of a maximal 2-identifiable parent property code of length greater than four. We present a direct construction of 2-secure frameproof codes with logarithmic length. This is the only known direct construction with logarithmic length codes. All other known constructions of short codes use recursive techniques. We introduce a new combinatorial object called difference function families which is a generalization of difference matrices. Using difference function families, we present recursive constructions that we can apply to small codes to obtain larger codes with the same security property. Our recursive techniques generalize some of the known recursive techniques and give better results. The most important advantage of our technique is that it can be applied to all secure codes and hash families. That is, it can be applied to frameproof codes, secure frameproof codes, IPP codes, TA codes, separating hash families, perfect hash families. No other known techniques have this property. We give a linear attack on the first traitor tracing scheme that uses bilinear pairing. We generalize this attack to all traitor tracing schemes in which decryption keys satisfy a linear equation. We show that in these schemes the length of the decryption key must depend on the collusion threshold in order to resist the linear attack. We derive a lower bound on the size of the decryption key length in terms of the number of colluders. We propose three new public key traitor tracing schemes based on bilinear maps. The first scheme is a modification of the Mitsunari et al's scheme. The second scheme is a generalization of the first scheme in which we use linear codes. And the final scheme has the revocation capacity by using Shamir's secret sharing technique. The security of all three schemes are provable and it is based on the decisional bilinear Diffie--Hellman assumption. These are the only known traitor tracing schemes using bilinear maps which have not been broken. We extend a result due to Kurosawa and Yoshida and show that public-key traitor tracing schemes with revocation can be constructed from linear codes. It means that we can have revocation for the Boneh-Franklin scheme, the corrected Kurosawa-Desmedt scheme and the linear-coded Kurosawa--Desmedt scheme. We also look at the problem of permanently removing a user to make the system scalable. We prove that it is impossible to obtain a remove-user procedure for the Boneh-Franklin scheme where all the secret part of user keys are kept unchanged and only the public encryption key and the public part of user keys are modified. We show an attack on the Dodis et al's scheme in which two users who had been removed in two different sessions can collaborate to obtain valid keys for future sessions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of information systems in inter-sectoral R&amp;D collaboration: the case of the Australian co-operative research centre (CRC) program</field><field name="creator">Nurharyoko, Gogor Oko</field><field name="description">Currently, in the process of creating innovation, some new forms of R &amp; D collaboration are emerging, to fulfil the demands of the knowledge-based systems that must integrate industrial, scientific and commercial elements. These new forms are normally based on an integration of several participants from different institutions becoming involved in an inter- sectoral collaboration. This has been the subject of intensive study in most industrialized countries including Australia since 1980s. The Co-operative Research Centre is the Australian Government&#65533;s answer to this new emerging phenomenon. With the growing numbers of inter-sectoral collaborations especially aimed at innovation, the development of new theories in this field remains important and necessary. The current emerging theories of inter-sectoral collaboration are investigating how knowledge can be produced within such a complex environment while others are investigating how participants interact and communicate. So far, little investigation has been spent on the actual content of what is being transacted within such a complex inter sectoral collaborative R &amp; D program, and what this (information) content and its transaction process may imply for the relationship among participants and finally how this may affect the performance of the entire collaboration. This thesis attempts to present an analysis of the above issues, taking Co-operative Research Centres (CRC) in Australia as case studies. From a theoretical perspective, the discussion in the thesis covers collaboration for innovation, information and the process of information transaction (including communication). The theoretical work also reviews the importance of the Internet in the process of information transaction in collaboration for innovation. The theoretical work pays special attention to the concepts of collaboration in the form of Mode-II Knowledge Production and the collaboration where the participants are specifically from University, Industry and Government agencies (the so-called &#65533;Triple Helix&#65533;). The main objective of the theoretical work is to develop a better model to describe the importance of information and information systems in inter sectoral R &amp; D collaboration. This new model is called the &#65533;Newt&#65533; model. To test the validity of the Newt model, fieldwork was conducted. The test was based on a qualitative analysis of data collected by using in depth interview with several important figures from each of the collaborating participants. Three CRCs were chosen as case studies. Since the model is intended to work in all CRCs, selection of the CRCs was done very carefully. The three CRCs reflect a very high degree of difference in terms of their type of research and are totally different research activities. They are the CRC for Welded Structures, (CRC WS) the CRC for Quality Wheat, (CRC QW) and the CRC for Advanced Computational System (ACSys CRC). The thesis concludes that the CRC collaboration can be considered as a useful activity for information transaction among different participants. This activity appears to be triggered by a dominant participant with a particular type of information, and the entire process of information transaction in the CRC is based on the improvement of this particular type of information. In the process of information transaction, the role of each participant is based on the type of information being transacted. A participant who possesses this particular type of information is more dominant and more influential in the process of information transaction, resulting in an imbalance of information capacity. This information imbalance further creates a unique power relationship among these participants within the CRC collaboration. Under such circumstance, the Internet information system has a dual role, on the one hand it may enhance the process of information transaction, but on the other hand it may contribute to affect the power relationship between participants in the CRC collaboration, that is to create a master to slave relationship. This finding has policy implications. It implies that there is a need to &#65533;label&#65533; each participant of CRC based on their information capacity both in terms of the quality and quantity of information that they hold. Before a CRC application can be approved and funded, a mapping of a likely dominant participant and those who are less likely to be dominant participants must be available. Based on such &#65533;information map&#65533; the government could support the CRC collaboration program more effectively.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of intervention with relatives of treatment resistant drinkers: changes in relatives' psychological functioning and drinkers' behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Fairbairn, Janis</field><field name="description">Forty three research participants (40 female, 3 male) who were in ongoing contact with treatment resistant dependent drinkers, completed the 10 session FOCUS intervention at the Australian Institute of Alcohol and Addictions (Holyoake) in Perth, Western Australia. This Holyoake intervention focussed exclusively on the needs of relatives of excessive drinkers and did not teach relatives how to encourage their drinkers into treatment. The intervention aimed to minimise the harm experienced by relatives by improving their well being and coping, and assisting them to recognise behaviours which may unwittingly enable their drinkers&#8217; excessive consumption to continue. Participants were allocated to one of 2 groups; viz. Immediate Entry to treatment or Waitlist. The Waitlist group commenced treatment at the completion of the waitlist period. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and there was a high level of consistency between the two analyses. The quantitative data were analysed by repeated measures MANOVA with treatment and time (pre, mid, end treatment and 3 months and 6 months post treatment) as the independent variables. Given the quasi-experimental design, the results need to be viewed cautiously. It appeared that the Holyoake intervention produced significant improvements in participants&#8217; mental health, coping, and relationship status which were sustained through 6 months post treatment. Moreover, as a &#8220;spin off&#8221; of treatment (according to participants&#8217; observations), a significant, sustained reduction in the amount of alcohol their drinkers consumed on any given drinking day was identified. Twenty five participants did not complete the intervention and 13 of these (the Late Dropout group) were available for follow up 5 weeks after completing 5 treatment sessions. Despite the small sample size, a pattern of significant effect similar to the Full Treatment group was evident on participants&#8217; mental health and coping status. Moreover, it seemed that the &#8220;spin off&#8221; effect of treatment on drinkers&#8217; abusive behaviour and consumption patterns was more pervasive for the Late Dropout group. These data suggested that the Late Dropout group may have decided to terminate treatment because their situations had improved. Participants&#8217; raw data (n=68), which included all participants who had commenced treatment, revealed that whilst 69% of their drinkers had either sought help (n=13) or reduced their consumption to some degree, 50% had made substantial change. Given data was analysed wherever possible by the intention to treat principle, these figures were also expressed in terms of all participants who had been allocated to treatment (n=83). Thus, the least favourable &#8220;spin off&#8221; effect on drinkers&#8217; behaviour appeared to be that whilst 57% had made some degree of positive change, 41% had made substantial change. Content analyses of the Full Treatment group&#8217;s qualitative interviews (n=43) revealed that only 16% of participants predominantly used assertive coping strategies to deal with difficult situations with their drinkers prior to the Holyoake intervention. However, by the end of the intervention, participants&#8217; use of assertive behaviours had increased dramatically to 81%; e.g. clear messages, emotional control and confidence, improved boundaries and communication, and assertive confrontation. Sixty seven percent of participants identified their own personal empowerment (i.e. self responsibility and self efficacy) as the most important factor which had helped them deal more effectively with their situations. This research in no way suggested that participants were in any way responsible for their drinkers' behaviour. It has merely highlighted the considerable influence one family member has on another. Therefore, this research seemed to debunk the widely held belief that dependent, treatment resistant drinkers cannot be helped until they admit their problem, and actively seek help.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"One bank, two cultural identities": a case study of Chinese and British influence on the financial practices of HSBC bank</field><field name="creator">Hui, Freda C. F</field><field name="description">After over 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong transferred its sovereignty to the Republic of China in 1997 under the catchcry of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221;. The most dominant bank in Hong Kong (1864-present) is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). This thesis explains the ensuing impact of the political and cultural change on the disclosures and accountability of HSBC.HSBC&#8217;s accounting practices are not independent and self-contained. They are shaped by HSBC&#8217;s unique history and culture, and are dependent on societal expectations. Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. The handover in 1997 brought to the fore differences in expectations and cross-cultural differences between the West and the East. Annual reports were increasingly used by the bank as a tool to legitimate HSBC with respect to societal expectations and maintain its reputation as a reliable &#8220;local&#8221; bank in Hong Kong. This study demonstrates how a bank uses financial reports politically to ensure survival and sustainability beyond the rhetoric of accountability.The contributions of the thesis are twofold. First, it theoretically develops links between Laughlin&#8217;s (1995) Middle Range Thinking (MRT) and Institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Skeletal theory guides and facilitates the discourse necessary for analyses of political, economic, and social influences on accounting and banking. Secondly, this thesis applies methodology and methods novel to research in banking to enable a contextual understanding of the Asia Pacific regulatory environments. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of investigation are employed. Because of the complexity of the situation of HSBC, an intersubjective approach to theorising is necessary to interrogate historical and cultural impacts.This thesis critiques the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy as it applies to the banking sector in Hong Kong. The case study of HSBC demonstrates that some significant events triggered the additional public disclosure in annual reports and public accountability in order for HSBC to legitimate itself to the new Hong Kong order and mainland China expectations. This new approach is valuable in this banking study because it gives a different perspective on acquiring banking knowledge. Blending Middle Range Thinking and Institutional theory is shown to compensate for the deficiencies in both theories.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On information hiding techniques for digital images</field><field name="creator">Brisbane, Gareth Charles</field><field name="description">In the era before digital devices, information was in part protected by the cost of duplication. However, as information is more commonly stored to and recovered from digital devices, its duplication becomes trivial. In recent years there has been an increasing amount of research into methods for embedding hidden information into items stored in digital formats. This information can then be used for a range of purposes, including content protection, traitor tracing, authentication and covert communications. In this thesis we exclusively consider the case of information hiding techniques for digital images. We address four problems in this research area: &#183; We consider the question, How much data can be imperceptibly embedded into an image, assuming that the sender and receiver have access to a shared image and that there is no modification of the communication during its transmission? Firstly, the maximum amount of information that can be sent for both monochrome and colour images using this model is derived. We then present coding strategies which nearly achieve the theoretical capacity, operating under the restrictions imposed by image formats, namely that the range of possible pixel values is limited. Results are provided demonstrating that the scheme can be used in practice to achieve the claimed throughput. &#183; We seek discover the set of N codevectors which best represent an n-dimensional, uniformly distributed space. This result could then be considered for the specific case of identifying the general colour palatte in Red/Green/Blue space which is best able to quantize a uniformly distributed colour image. The problem is addressed initially from a theoretical perspective, followed by an empirical analysis. The results are then compared, in terms of distorttion caused by quantization, against lattices, which are known to be an optimal selection of codevectors for large N. &#183; Seppanen, Makela and Kreskinarkaus propose a high capacity steganographic technique to conceal information within a colour image[72], using a shared colour palette. The technique is significant because of the high volume of data that is embedded into pixels but results in a high level of noise and so the quality of the resulting image is not acceptable. We propose: - Technique to improve the tradeoff between capacity and imperceptibility; - New &#8220;coding structures&#8221; which maintain a high capacity but lower the level of noise; - A strategy for increasing robustness; and - An analysis of the tradeoff by using an alternative algorithm for identifying the colour palette. Results are provided for the evaluation of each proposed modification. The resultant scheme, without robustness, is able to embed an average of over 6 bits per pixel at an imperceptible level of pixel modification. &#183; A robust watermarking technique is proposed which modifies the statistics of extracted segments. By using a region-based approach, resistance is provided to a range of attacks, including rotation, scaling and translation based modifications. The advantage of this algorithm is that no manual pre-processing is required: the detection algorithm is able to confirm the presence of the watermark with only the attacked image. The algorithm is shown to be moderately resistant to a large number of attacks including compression, cropping and rotation</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Binding and fate of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 in breast carcinoma cells: rationale for development as a delivery vehicle of cytotoxins for anti-urokinase therapeutic strategies</field><field name="creator">Al-Ejeh, Fares</field><field name="description">Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) is one of the inhibitors of the plasminogen activation cascade mediated by urokinase (uPA) which is overexpressed on the surface of metastatic cancer cells. The plasminogen activation cascade is the generator of plasmin proteolytic activity on the cell surface which is required under normal physiological conditions and is largely exploited during cancer invasion and metastasis. The overall aim of this thesis was mainly to characterise the inhibition of cell-surface uPA by exogenously added PAI-2 and the elucidation of the fate of uPA:PAI-2 complexes once formed on the cell surface. PAI-2 was directly confirmed as a potent and rapid inhibitor of cell-surface uPA and specifically targets this antigen. PAI-2 internalised rapidly in a uPA-dependent manner after complex formation with cell-surface receptor (uPAR)-bound uPA. Internalised PAI-2 localised in endosomes/ lysosomes where it was presumably degraded. While the majority of uPAR/uPA:PAI-2 complexes formed on the cell surface were internalised, cellsurface uPA appeared to be replenished and uPAR was recycled to the cell surface. These findings were significant as they provide new information regarding cell-surface regulation of the plasminogen activation system as well as a biological rationale for the use of PAI-2 as a delivery vehicle of cytotoxins for anti-uPA therapeutic strategies. To extend the analyses of PAI-2 binding to cells and its subsequent fate, breast cancer cells were genetically modified to provide material for this study. Modulation of uPA-receptor (uPAR) expression was found to induce changes in components of the plasminogen activation cascade on the cell-surface. Upregulation of cell-surface uPAR on non-invasive, low uPAR/uPA-expressing T-47D breast cancer cells caused a concomitant increase in cell-surface uPA. This caused an increase in PAI-2 binding capacity to cells, thus directly confirming uPA-specificity of PAI-2. In addition, uPAR upregulation induced an increase in the lysine-dependent binding of plasminogen to the surface of these cells. Although cell-surface uPA was not confidently excluded as receptor for plasminogen binding on uPAR-modulated cells, the increase in plasminogen binding on these cells is ultimately due to increase in cell-surface plasminogen receptors. Finally, upregulation of uPAR also affected cell morphology and all together the data confirmed that uPAR/uPA-upregulation is associated with adoption of a metastatic genotype/phenotype. These results support other interests in our laboratory directed towards concluding whether uPA may act as a plasminogen receptor via an active-site independent epitope and elucidating plasminogen receptors which may be modulated due to modulation of uPAR/uPA expression. Finally, this thesis aimed at optimising the preparation of PAI-2 as a uPA-targeting vehicle for cancer radiotherapy and radioimaging applications. PAI-2 was modified by the addition of the metal chelator cDTPA; the product was characterised and radiolabelling with a radioisotope suitable for radiotherapy was optimised. These results allowed the development of standard operating procedures for use in pre-clinical and potentially clinical studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of non antibiotic resistant recombinant vaccines against mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</field><field name="creator">Matic, Jake</field><field name="description">Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen of pigs that has substantial global economic impact and currently there is no vaccine available that prevents colonisation. This study focuses on the characterisation of novel M. hyopneumoniae vaccine candidates and the development of a live, attenuated vaccine expressing heterologous M. hyopneumoniae antigens. The putative M. hyopneumoniae vaccine antigen, the lipoyl binding domain of the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase subunit (PdhD) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was strongly recognised by porcine hyperimmune sera. Western blot analysis with PdhD antisera detected the protein in geographically diverse M. hyopneumoniae isolates. However PdhD was only weakly recognised by convalescent swine sera indicating it is not likely to contribute significantly to the protective convalescent response. Therefore it was not used in further vaccination experiments. Live vaccine delivery systems expressing two antigens from M. hyopneumoniae, adhesin (Adh) and ribonucleotide reductase (NrdF), were constructed using either plasmid-based expression (PBE) or chromosomally-based expression (CBE) systems. The PBE system was formed by cloning both antigen genes into pJLA507 to create an operon downstream of temperature-inducible promoters. Constitutive CBE was achieved using a promoter trapping technique whereby the promoterless operon was stably integrated into the chromosome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium aroA (STM-1) and the expression of antigens assessed. The chromosomal position of the operon was mapped in four clones. Inducible CBE was obtained using the in vivo induced sspA promoter and recombining the expression construct into aroD. Dual expression of the antigens was detected in all systems with PBE producing much higher quantities of both antigens. The stability of antigen expression was higher in the CBE system with 60-100% of individual cells still expressing antigen after 60 generations without selection. PBE and CBE strains were selected for comparison in a vaccination trial. The vaccine strains were delivered orally into mice and significant systemic IgM and IgG responses against both antigens amongst all CBE groups were detected. No significant immune response against either antigen was detected using PBE strains. Expression of recombinant antigens in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium aroA from chromosomally-located strong promoters without the use of antibiotic resistance markers is a reliable and effective method of inducing a significant immune response.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soy Isoflavone bioavailability - effects of probiotic and prebiotic consumption and oil supplementation</field><field name="creator">Larkin, Theresa Anne</field><field name="description">Epidemiological evidence suggests a beneficial effect of soy consumption in relation to cardiovascular disease and in 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a health claim for the cholesterol-lowering effects of soy protein. However, this effect has not always been reproduced in subsequent soy dietary interventions, the results of which vary greatly. Soy beans are the richest dietary source of the isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein, which have also been implicated with a role in lipid-lowering due to their antioxidant and estrogen receptor activities. After soy intake, there is large variability between individuals in isoflavone bioavailability. The isoflavones are present in soy as glycoside conjugates and after endogenous hydrolysis, the aglycones are absorbed, metabolised by liver and intestinal enzymes, distributed to tissues and excreted in urine. Endogenous isoflavone metabolites have been identified; of particular interest is the metabolism of daidzein to equol, as this has greater antioxidant and estrogen receptor activities than daidzein. Gut microflora is essential for isoflavone bioavailability and metabolism and can be affected by dietary modification. Differences in gut microflora composition may contribute to the large inter-individual variability in these processes, which in turn may contribute to variation in the lipid effects of soy consumption. Recently there has been much interest in the identification of dietary components that may enhance soy isoflavone bioavailability and it was the aim of this thesis to examine the effects of soy foods and other dietary components on soy isoflavone bioavailability and lipids. Four human studies were conducted and isoflavone bioavailability was determined based on plasma and urinary isoflavone levels. These samples were extracted with Helix Pomatia juice containing &#65533;&#65533;-glucuronidases and sulphatases and the isoflavone aglycones were quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Resistant starch is a prebiotic and therefore has specific effects on gut microflora activity in the gastrointestinal tract and it was hypothesised that resistant starch intake may also affect isoflavone bioavailability. A pilot study with nine females (7 Australian and 2 Kenyan) was conducted to determine the acute and chronic effects of resistant starch intake on soy isoflavone bioavailability. When resistant starch was consumed in the same meal as soy, plasma levels of daidzein and genistein were significantly reduced. However, daily resistant starch intake for 2 and 4 weeks prior to a soy meal resulted in a trend of increased mean daidzein excretion and of increased equol production in the two Kenyan subjects. It was concluded that resistant starch may enhance equol production, possibly dependent on gut microflora, genetics or habitual diet. To determine whether there was an association between isoflavone bioavailability and lipid changes after soy intake, a soy dietary intervention was conducted in 23 hyperlipidemic men and postmenopausal women. Plasma and urinary daidzein and genistein levels were increased significantly after 6 weeks of soy milk and yoghurt intake. This treatment did not significantly affect lipids and there were no correlations between plasma or urinary isoflavone levels and lipid changes. However, in 8 subjects who produced equol in their plasma or urine, soy intake resulted in significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol. This suggests that metabolism of daidzein to equol may be a determinant of the lipid-lowering effects of soy, contributing to this variation. Based on the findings of the first two studies, a dietary combination of soy (cereal and milk) with either a probiotic or a prebiotic was proposed for further examination of the effects of resistant starch and equol production on isoflavone bioavailability and lipid levels. In a study of crossover design with 5-week dietary periods, soy consumption was compared with intake of soy plus either probiotic yoghurt or resistant starch-enriched bread for the effects on plasma and urinary isoflavone levels after a test soy meal in 31 hyperlipidemic men and postmenopausal women. Soy intake significantly increased circulating plasma daidzein and genistein levels, but did not affect plasma or urinary isoflavones after the test soy meal. There were no additional significant effects of either probiotic or prebiotic treatments; however, there was a trend for increased circulating plasma daidzein and genistein with probiotic treatment and for increased plasma daidzein and genistein 24 hours after the test soy meal with prebiotic treatment. Probiotic or prebiotic treatment did not induce or increase equol production, though there was a trend for increased plasma equol in &#65533;&#65533;equol-positive&#65533;&#65533; subjects (n = 12) after probiotic treatment. The lack of any overall significant effects on isoflavone bioavailability with either probiotic or prebiotic treatment suggests that even if gut microflora was modified, this was not favourable for isoflavone bioavailability or equol production and thus it appears that other inherent features may determine these processes. Total cholesterol was significantly decreased with soy plus probiotic or prebiotic intake (-4.7 &#65533;b 2.0% and -5.5 &#65533;b 1.6% respectively) and LDL cholesterol was significantly decreased with soy intake and with prebiotic treatment (-4.1 &#65533;b 2.1% and -7.3 &#65533;b 2.2% respectively). This suggests that even in the absence of effects on isoflavone bioavailability, there was synergistic action between soy and probiotic or prebiotic intake for lipid-lowering effects and thus combination of these dietary components may be useful in lipid management. For further examination of potential lipid-lowering effects of soy in synergy with other dietary components, it was hypothesised that a novel combination of soy with DHA-rich oil may also affect isoflavone bioavailability and result in a more positive lipid profile than supplementation with either component alone. DHA supplementation has strong triglyceride lowering effects, but it often also results in elevated LDL cholesterol, whereas conversely, a reduction in LDL is the most commonly reported lipid effect of dietary soy intake. In a crossover study with 35 hyperlipidemic men and postmenopausal women, plasma and urinary isoflavones were significantly increased after 6 weeks of soy (cereal) intake, but there were no significant effects of DHA-rich oil supplementation. Soy intake did not result in any significant lipid effects; however DHA supplementation resulted in a significant increase in HDL and decrease in triglycerides, independent of concurrent soy intake. In addition, there was an influence of the combination of DHA and soy compared with DHA alone for total and LDL cholesterol. While total and LDL cholesterol were increased with DHA supplementation alone, significantly for LDL, these increases were somewhat attenuated with concurrent soy intake. This suggests the potential for a combination of soy and n-3 fatty acids in producing lipid effects protective in relation to cardiovascular disease. When the latter three studies were compared, a relation between the daidzein and genistein levels of food with the ratios of these isoflavones in plasma and urine was evident, however some effects of soy food matrix were observed. Soy milk intake resulted in greater genistein bioavailability than daidzein compared to their relative amounts in the soy milk, while resistant starch intake appeared to increase daidzein excretion more than genistein. Furthermore, there was a particular finding of high occurrence of equol in plasma in the third study examining the combination of soy with oil; this was suggested to be due to the higher proportions of daidzein and glycitein than genistein in the soy germ product ingredient of the cereal. Overall, there appears to be the potential for probiotic and prebiotic foods and the soy matrix isoflavone composition to influence soy isoflavone bioavailability. These findings are important in relation to physiological activities of soy foods as the isoflavones differ in their bioactivity and require further investigation. Further, in relation to lipid effects of soy consumption, baseline levels of total and LDL cholesterol were both significantly inversely correlated with subsequent lipid changes with soy intake. In addition, there were beneficial additive hypocholesterolemic effects of soy with probiotic and prebiotic foods and with DHA-rich oil supplementation. In conclusion, the bioavailability of isoflavones from soy is affected by other dietary components and the soy matrix in which they are contained. This did not appear to influence lipid effects which were modest and only significant when soy was consumed concurrently with other dietary components also known to produce beneficial effects. The latter finding has application in the development of functional foods for those with elevated lipids.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online health services: study of user perceptions of the perceived usefulness of an evolving web-based health community using Q-methodology and activity theory</field><field name="creator">Mok, Ngo Lui M</field><field name="description">The main question asked in this study is what are the perceived information needs of clinical professionals working in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that can usefully be accommodated with a Web-based Information Service?

The use of very wide transmission bandwidth brings significant advantages in terms of high speed as well as low power transmission compared to traditional narrow band technologies. Ultra-wideband operation does not require a spectrum license but ultra-wideband devices are required to share spectrum with licensed narrow band users. As a concept to solve coexistence issues with other devices, cognitive radio used with ultra-wideband now becomes a new hot topic. Two mainstream development directions of ultra-wideband, MB-OFDM and DS based UWB, have all provided some cognitive solutions. However, both of them involve complicated computations such as IFFT/FFT and multiple pulse combination, not only increasing system complexity but also increasing manufacturing cost and power consumption.  This thesis presents a novel system for DS based UWB. The proposed dynamic bandwidth direct sequence (DBDS) system, focused on exploring a new idea rather than concentrating on impulse manipulation, provides a cognitive solution for DS based UWB in much simpler and more efficient way. Enhanced from the original MCIDS algorithm, this system is able to transfer data under a fraction of original spread spectrum signal bandwidth and different spectral shapes while maintaining the same data rate. This system does not require generating specific impulse for working environment, therefore significantly reduces system complexity.  Different types of filters in the system enable a variety of potential transmission spectrums to satisfy cognitive radio needs. This thesis also introduces a symbol combining mechanism over the original MCIDS to guarantee system performance under multipath channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the DBDS has a very exciting performance. Even received with different bandwidths and different spectral shapes, the data information can still be fully recovered at the same data rate. The BER-Eb/No curve in ideal Gaussian channel exactly matches the theoretical curve, indicating that this system performs lossless with partial signal bandwidth. In multipath channel, the DBDS system still offers an excellent performance, incurring only a slight loss due to the cyclic prefix compared to the result in ideal Gaussian channel.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MIMO block spread OFDMA system for next generation mobile communications</field><field name="creator">Yu, Yiwei</field><field name="description">Wireless communications are developing at a booming speed, with plenty of research emerging on the next generation wireless communications. This thesis presents an advanced system for the next generation wireless communications. The proposed system is called block spread OFDMA combined with STC-MIMO (STC-MIMO BS-OFDMA). The system is based on OFDM, which is able to deliver high data rates in highly dispersive channels and is thereby considered as a good candidate of modulation techniques for 4G. The block spreading technique and STC-MIMO scheme are used to provide the system with frequency and spatial diversity, therefore significantly improving system performance.In this system, there are two stages to combine block spreading and STC-MIMO with OFDMA. Firstly, a novel block spreading approach is applied to effectively achieve frequency diversity in the OFDMA system without any explicit precoding process. The STC-MIMO using Alamouti code is then incorporated on block basis and performs in space and frequency. Accordingly, the signal model and architectures of the proposed system are presented. Two receiver architectures are designed for different STC-MIMO schemes: the receiver with one antenna and receiver with two antennas.Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the expected performance improvement. The BER performance comparisons indicate that the proposed system can achieve significant performance improvement. The research project also investigates the system performance when different parameters are used. Our results show that using a larger block spreading size and more receive antennas can further improve system performance because of higher order of diversity advantages. In terms of linear equalizations, the MMSE equalization achieves better performance than the ZF equalization.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial literacy among university students: an Australian case study</field><field name="creator">Bird, Sonia</field><field name="description">Financial literacy has been defined by the National Foundation for Education Research as &#8216;the ability to make informed judgments and to take effective decisions regarding the use and management of money&#8217; (Noctor, Stoney and Stradling, 1992, p. 4). This study investigates the financial literacy levels of Australian university students, using students studying at the University of Wollongong (UOW) as a case study.An online financial literacy survey was distributed to all UOW students and was designed to collect extensive details regarding study characteristics, demographic characteristics, attitudes and perceptions, as well as testing knowledge and skills across a range of specific areas of financial literacy. In addition, the survey enabled a comparison between student&#8217;s own perceptions of their knowledge and/or skills and their actual demonstrated level of knowledge and/or skills.From the survey results, it is concluded that while Australian university students have a satisfactory level of general financial literacy, there are particular areas where they scored low which need to be addressed. It is also found that low financial literacy is associated with students with certain demographic characteristics.This research is extensive in both length and scope and attempted to fill in gaps in the current literature. It provides a valuable contribution to ongoing financial literacy research which can only continue to grow as a result of the increasing importance of personal financial literacy skills and knowledge in modern societies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The link between emotional intelligence and graduate qualities: implications for accounting education</field><field name="creator">Jones, Gregory Evan</field><field name="description">This research highlights the graduate qualities that universities expect students to develop by the time they complete their undergraduate degree and emerge from university.  It focuses on the Faculty of Commerce at the University of Wollongong, and in particular the School of Accounting and Finance.  It considers the relatively new concept of emotional intelligence (EI) and how enhancing EI development in students may assist in achieving improvement in the graduate quality outcomes for students.  This research develops the link between the types of skills that are required by accounting practitioners and the graduate qualities students are expected to have developed by the time they leave university. It then suggests how enhancing EI skills can promote development of the types of skills the students are likely to need to be successful in the working environment.  This has been achieved by reviewing the current literature relating to the roles undertaken by accounting practitioners together with traditional and contemporary descriptions and measures of intelligence.  This review suggests that providing students with the opportunity to enhance EI may promote graduate qualities and improve success in the working environment.  The research initially develops an understanding of the variety of graduate quality descriptions, and then highlights the present opportunities for students to improve their skills by evaluating the subject outlines for accounting and finance majors to see if there is a concerted approach to promoting graduate qualities. A survey of EI levels of academics in the Faculty of Commerce was conducted to determine the level of understanding of EI, factors that may influence EI, and the teaching implications for promoting EI is then presented.  The results have demonstrated that the skills necessary to be successful in the working environment, due to the enhancement of the accounting role, include a large number of EI elements.  Factors that may improve EI levels for individuals comprise exposure to a variety of experiences, and teaching from real world situations.  There was no evidence found to suggest that EI is affected by gender, but alternatively the research suggested that EI might be adversely affected by working for prolonged periods in the one environment, with variety of experience improving EI.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy analysis of workplace rehabilitation policy within workers' compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines from 1987 to 1997: towards improved occupational health outcomes for injured coal miners</field><field name="creator">Pelham, Natalie</field><field name="description">Workplace rehabilitation gained greater prominence as a means of both containing the costs of workers&#8217; compensation claims and improving return to work outcomes for injured workers following a period of policy debate and reform from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. As a result, rehabilitation was integrated into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements throughout Australia. However, coal mines in NSW took a different path, one which did not fully integrate rehabilitation into its workers&#8217; compensation arrangements (hybrid model). This thesis set out to examine why coal mines in NSW took a different path and the implications through the following research questions: 1) How did the hybrid model for workplace rehabilitation within workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines (at 1996) differ from that in place in other NSW industries? 2) Why was workplace rehabilitation not fully implemented into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements for NSW coal mines? What factors influenced the decision-making process and led to the hybrid model (1987 &#8211; 1997)? 3) How did workplace rehabilitation programs in NSW coal mines (at 1996) compare to those recommended in the literature? 4) How did the hybrid model work in practice in NSW coal mines (at 1996)? What was its impact on the delivery of workplace rehabilitation?  Was it working effectively? Where and Where not? Why and why not? 5) How could effective workplace rehabilitation programs be delivered in NSW coal mines? 6) What conclusions may be drawn in relation to the public policy process and what recommendations may be made for workplace rehabilitation policy in NSW coal mines?Using a policy analysis framework described by Hill1, this thesis examined the various influences on policy formulation and  implementation in order to understand the public policy making process better. How the hybrid model differed from the recommended integrated model (research question 1) was determined through a comparison of the two models. This identified points of difference and therefore points of potential influence in policy development.An historical analysis and interviews were conducted to understand why the integrated model was not fully implemented in NSW coal mines (research question 2). This assisted the Researcher to identify individuals, groups and organised interests that were involved in the development of this policy, their roles and how they exerted influence over policy formulation.A literature review of previous research  findings in rehabilitation and return to work was undertaken (research question 3). It uncovered information to support workplace rehabilitation as a means of delivering improved return to work outcomes for injured workers, as well as to identify the elements of an effective workplace rehabilitation program. This provided a basis for comparison between literature on workplace rehabilitation and what was in practice in NSW coal mines. To assess the operation of workplace rehabilitation in NSW coal mines (research question 4), a survey by questionnaire and interviews of stakeholders participating in its operation was conducted. This provided an understanding of how the  hybrid model worked in practice and insight into the policy process, especially factors impacting on implementation.Next, a workplace rehabilitation audit was developed and trialed in six coal mines over a two year period to assess whether such a tool could improve the operation of workplace rehabilitation (research question 5). The trial provided additional information about workplace rehabilitation thereby adding to its knowledge base. It also provided  information about the implementation of policy into operational settings and how it might be made more successful.Finally, all results from the policy analysis were reviewed to determine what set of recommendations might be made for: the workplace rehabilitation policy framework for NSW coal mines; improving the management of workplace rehabilitation in NSW coal mines; and for the conduct of future research (research question 6). In short, why a hybrid model for workplace rehabilitation was implemented in NSW coal mines instead of the recommended policy framework occurred for a number of reasons. Firstly, key stakeholders, CMI, Employers and Unions, were not represented in high level government policy making mechanisms for workplace rehabilitation policy. This made it difficult for them to participate in the  development of policy principles which would later apply to them. As a result, they did not fully comprehend the new arrangements and how they might interact with workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in place for NSW coal mines. Secondly, key stakeholders, particularly the Unions, were able to influence parliamentary processes to exclude their constituency from legislated elements of the recommended policy framework. Thirdly, key stakeholders including CMI, the Unions and to some extent Employers continued to operate under the old paradigm for workers&#8217; compensation, that is, as a means of providing financial recompense in the event of an injury rather than as a means of providing workplace rehabilitation and return to work. This militated against acceptance of workplace rehabilitation as an integral component of workers&#8217; compensation arrangements. Fourthly, the differences between the hybrid model and the recommended policy framework for workplace rehabilitation were not recognised. Subsequently, implementation of the hybrid model was not altered to account for these differences and therefore achievement of original policy objectives was limited. These factors restricted the integration of workplace rehabilitation into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines.Through this research, an in-depth  understanding of the development and operation of workplace rehabilitation policy in NSW coal mines in the period under review was gained. Factors that influenced the  development of public policy were identified thereby contributing to the theoretical  understanding of the policy process. Factors relevant to the operation of workplace rehabilitation policy were also uncovered and a method of improving the delivery of workplace rehabilitation programs was tested which provided important insights into policy implementation. The trial of the workplace rehabilitation audit demonstrated that using such a tool, specifically designed for NSW coal mines, could facilitate policy implementation thereby aiding achievement of original policy objectives. This thesis therefore informed policy theory and practice in an attempt to contribute to the further understanding of workplace  rehabilitation and its ability to improve occupational health outcomes for injured coal miners.1 Hill Michael, The Policy Process in the Modern State, 3rd Edition, Prentice-Hall, Sydney, 1997</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of nanoparticle melting or freezing</field><field name="creator">Wu, Bisheng</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a mathematical modelling in nanotechnology. Many ex- periments and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the melting point of nanoparticles shows a size-dependent characteristic in the nanoscale. Based on the assumption that the material is a pure one, the melting process of spherical and cylindrical particles, especially nanoparticles, is treated as a Stefan moving boundary problem. Analytical or semi-analytical approaches, such as small-time perturbation expansions with front-&#175;xing techniques, large Stefan number limit, integral iterative scheme, and numerical methods, such as enthalpy scheme and front-&#175;xing method, are applied to the one- and or two- phase Stefan problem in spherical and cylindrical domains by taking into account the e&#174;ect of the interfacial or surface tension. The results from these methods are compared and show excellent agreement to some ex- tent. This thesis may provide a possibility of explaining some interesting phenomena occurring in the physical experiments, i.e. superheating and \abrupt melting", or work as a guide for the potential applications of nanoparticles, for example, drug delivery, nanoimprinting and targeted ablation of tumor cells In Chapter 1, a simply survey of the research background is given. Chapter 2 studies the full classical two-phase Stefan problems without surface or interfacial tension. By using the approach from large Stefan number limit and small-time perturbation methods, long- and short-time solutions are obtained, and the results from these methods are compared with the numerical enthalpy scheme. The limits of zero Stefan-number and slow di&#174;usion in the inner core are also noted. Chapter 3 presents the melting of a spherical or cylindrical nanoparticle by including the e&#174;ects of surface tension through the Gibbs-Thomson condition. A single-phase melting limit is derived from the general two-phase formulation, and the resulting equations are studied analytically in the limit of small time and large Stefan number. Further analytical approximations for the temperature distribution and the position of the solid-melt interface are found by applying an integral formulation together with an iterative scheme. All these analytical results are compared with numerical solutions obtained using a numerical front-&#175;xing method, and they are shown to provide good approximations in various regimes. In Chapters 4 and 5, the methods used in above sections are extended to the melting problem for spherical and cylindrical ii nanoparticles, respectively. The results from these approaches are compared with those from the numerical front-&#175;xing method. The original contributions of this thesis are: approximate analytical solutions are obtained for the classical two-phase Stefan problems in a spherical domain; a general single-phase limit for the melting of nanoparticles are derived and analyzed with the correct boundary conditions; a critical radius is found to exist for the blow-up of the one-phase melting; the melting process of spherical and cylindrical nanoparticles are studied analytically from the perspective of Stefan moving boundary problem by including the e&#174;ect of surface tension; some interesting phenomena observed in physical experiments, i.e. superheating and \abrupt melting", are explained in terms of Stefan problems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical research into the metacapitalism efficiency in the Australian Telecommunications Industry</field><field name="creator">Xu, Geyi</field><field name="description">MetaCapitalism is publicly introduced by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2000 as a methodology that assists firms in becoming more efficient by means of decapitalisation, downsizing and innovation in value-added communities. However, can MetaCapitalism contribute to our understanding of market performance, especially in view of the current credit crisis? Hence, the Australian telecommunications sector is chosen for a primary test regarding the effects of MetaCapitalism on company&#8217;s market performance. The relevant data is collected from 1989 to 2007.  MetaCapitalism strategy is measured by six indices as the change of total assets (TA), property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E), net working capital (NWC) the percentage of  PP&amp;E/TA, NWC/TA and (PP&amp;E+NWC)/TA from one period to the next. Share price is adopted as the market performance indicator underlining the efficient market paradigm.    The key findings show that the Australian telecom companies have been following the strategy since 1989 especially notable is that there are large scale decapitalisations during the year 2000. All six MetaCapitalism indices demonstrate frequent fluctuations during the 18-year period. Key conclusions are that even though decreasing PP&amp;E at certain level may have a positive impact on market performance especially for large scale companies, TA and NWC are of vital importance to telecom companies. Another important finding is that the empirical result proves the reflexivity of the stock market, where its cognitive function and manipulative function demonstrate different perceptions of the MetaCapitalism efficiency changes. In conclusion, the empirical results revealed strong evidence against the MetaCaptalism assumptions proposed by PwC.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the reasons parents and carers of children with asthma declined to attend self management education programs</field><field name="creator">Smith, Heather</field><field name="description">The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate why parents or carers of children with asthma chose not to attend asthma self management education. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents who had declined an invitation to attend the Illawarra Asthma Service. Participants expressed that they felt confident in their ability to self manage their children with asthma, four of the respondents indicated that they already felt confident and did not feel they needed to participate in the education offered to them. One respondent sought self management education from an educator at her General Practitioners surgery; this family were able to implement many self management behaviours. The remaining respondent had previously attended the service and in their experience the benefits of attending were negligible and they believed they were doing everything possible to manage their children&#65533;s asthma. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was included as a theoretical framework to explain and predict this health behaviour. Major themes emergent from the interviews relating to the theory include self confidence, attitudes towards self management education, experience of asthma, skills and knowledge, transport, time, confidence in medical managers, and parental responsibility. Support, an additional theme, was identified which was not directly related to the determinants of behaviour change identified within the Theory of Planned Behaviour. This model of health behaviour has provided some insight into the issues related to attendance at self management education and adoption of self management behaviours for parents and carers of children with asthma. Attitudes to self management education also had a strong relationship with this population&#65533;s ability to adopt self management strategies. A range of interventions have been proposed to identify those families that have not already implemented behaviours reflective of best practice in asthma self management and to facilitate attendance at self management education for these families.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of growth data for breastfed infants and its relevance to breastfeeding</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Emer</field><field name="description">Monitoring infants growth in the first year of life is a complex issue. It has been almost twenty years since the last Australian research was published on the topic of infant feeding methods and growth and no studies have compared Australian breastfed infants with the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 1977 reference longer than three months. The NCHS Hamill et al. (1977) standard is the World Health Organisation (W.H.O.) recommended guideline currently accepted in Australia. It was decided to explore a sample of breastfeeding women of European descent and their infants from metropolitan Sydney and semi-rural NSW. The research hypothesis is, that the mean weight and length of breastfed infants, is significantly less at 1 year than the NCHS reference (Hamill et al. 1977) currently in use and with the revised Center for Disease Control (CDC) 2000 reference chart. Therefore the null hypothesis is that the mean weight and length of breastfed infants at 1 year are equal to the true mean weight and length of the Hamill et al. (1977) NCHS reference currently used at the time. The study is not representative of all breastfeeding mothers as subjects were attendees of Child Health Clinics who were following advice of Child and Family Health nurses. Methods: In order to test this hypothesis the weight and length of 300 breastfed infants was collated for each month between 1 month and 12 months of age and put into the format of a mathematical slope. Sections of the slope in a time series were compared e.g. 1 month to 3 months, 3 months to 6 months and 6 months to 12 months respectively. The reasons for this comparison in a time series are - 1. The literature review provided evidence that between 1 month and 3 months, breastfed infants grow faster than the current NCHS (1979) reference. 2. Between 3 months and 6 months breastfed infants growth rate begins to slow down when compared to the current NCHS (1979) reference. 3. Between 6 months and 12 months, breastfed infants continue to grow at a slower rate that the current NCHS (1979) reference. Following the collection of data, a series of slopes on a graph for weight and length was prepared for the comparison between male and female breastfed infants and the NCHS (Hamill et al.1977) data and the CDC (2000) revised data. The slopes of the graphs were compared mathematically using a statistical format and a p value of (less than)0.05 was considered significantly different. The gradient was measured using a 95% confidence interval statistic on the slopes of the graphs for weight and length between 1 and 3 months, between 3 and 6 months, and, 6 and 12 months and compared with the NCHS (1977) data and the revised version CDC (2000). Results: When the breastfed group was compared to the NCHS (1977) reference between 1 month and 3 months, male and female infants grew at a faster rate than the NCHS reference. The breastfed group continued to be above the average weight gain of the slope suggested by the revised CDC 2000 reference also during this time period. Between 3 and 6 months only the weight of both sexes is significantly different and it begins to slow down at this time, growing slower than both the NCHS and CDC average. The CDC 2000 guide also remains faster than the breastfed group between 3 and 6 months. Between 6 and 12 months, only the female breastfed infants weight gain was slower at the end of the first year and was significantly different to the NCHS reference. Male weight and length grew at a similar rate to the NCHS (1977) reference. Compared with the slope of the revised CDC 2000 reference between 6 - 12 months, both male and female breastfed infants gained weight at a slower rate, p (less than)0.05. Using the statistical t test on the terminal figures at 12 months demonstrated that there was not a significant difference at 1 year between the mean weight of the breastfed infants group, the NCHS and the revised CDC 2000 reference - p (less than) 0.05. It was assumed from testing the null hypothesis at 12 months, that Australian breastfed infants when measured against the NCHS (Hamill et al. 1977) and the revised CDC 2000 reference do not vary at the age of 1 year as much as previously thought. This may be due to the possibility that previous research did not record the breastfeeding management of the infants in their studies. Discussion: If infants were breastfed to a schedule of three or four hours they would not have the opportunity to gain weight at the same rate as infants who had free access to breastfeeding. The infants in this study were recorded as having been exclusively breastfed, fully breastfed or breastfed to need and may have had the opportunity to gain more weight. Fewer observations were available for length than for weight as time progressed which implies that most infants are weighed, but only some are measured. The implication of these results - from the data presented in this study- is, if clinicians use the existing charts as a guide to monitor adequate (good) weight gain of breastfed infants, that these infants will be seen as not gaining adequate weight or failure to thrive after the age of 3 months. This in turn has a potential to lead to the suggestion for offering breastmilk substitutes particularly after the age of three months, unless a thorough history is taken on the womans breastfeeding management. A serendipitous finding in this study was that Australian formula-fed infants may be heavier than breastfed infants. Two possible explanations for this were suggested - that parents are overfeeding, used heaped scoops of powder i.e. - intentional overfeeding -, or that parents are following the guidelines on the label of the formula tins and these volumes are inflated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of aging on functions of the prefrontal cortex</field><field name="creator">Fox, Geoffrey Arthur</field><field name="description">Primary Aging is a term used to describe the effects of the passage of time on the human body, particularly after 50 years of age. The effects may be contained or reversed. Secondary Aging describes the effects of a pathological process, commonly associated with the passage of time. The effects are difficult to contain, cannot be reversed, and progress to death. The thesis addresses two issues, namely can the two conditions be accurately differentiated by neuropsychological tests, and are the effects of Primary Aging first observed in functions commonly associated with the prefrontal cortex. The research technique is that of Real World Research (Robson, 1993), using mostly clients of the author&#65533;s private practice, with volunteers whose ages were greater than 59 years. After discussing the various theoretical positions concerning prefrontal functions and the dysexecutive syndrome, the thesis addresses the evidence that supports or queries the influence of primary aging on prefrontal functions. The general consensus of authors is that the prefrontal cortex supports a wide range of brain systems by reciprocal connections. It is emphasised that dysfunction in one part of a system remote from the prefrontal cortex is capable of producing behaviour which suggests a disorder of the prefrontal cortex. It is also emphasised that the prefrontal cortex is a system of connections, and three of these critical circuits are described. Because one of the functions of the PFC is to activate alternate circuits, the PFC system may be able to compensate for damage in one part of the circuit, thus masking the effects of damage. It is proposed that white matter demyelination may play a significant role in the process of disconnection between systems. Measures employed in the research are detailed, and their use justified by systematic analyses of the relevant scores, using the records of past clients of the practice. The research database comprised 184 new clients and volunteers. Four main factors were extracted from the database of 14 test scores, namely Verbal Working Memory, Non-verbal Working Memory, Inhibitory Process and Sensori-motor Speed. The results of the primary aging group suggested a selective decrement in skills. On the other hand, results of the secondary aging group clearly demonstrated global deficits, even when a client showed no obvious symptoms of mild dementia. This distinction was clarified by showing that primary aging effects were more similar to the effects of selective brain damage, as in mild traumatic head injury, and that secondary aging effects were more similar to the effects of a global pattern, as seen in clients with long-standing intellectual deficits. A battery of twelve tests employed demonstrated 100 percent discrimination between the clients assigned to the primary aging group and those assigned to the secondary aging group.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian girl readers, femininities and feminism in the second world war (1939-1945): a study of subjectivity and agency</field><field name="creator">Webb, Rosemary Ferguson</field><field name="description">The thesis argues that in the unique society of second world war Australia girls had agency and used this agency so that the meaning of both the idea of girl and the idea of young femininity were altered. They did this in ways which made their experience of girlhood and young womanhood more satisfying. Furthermore, their agency created a notion of youthful femininity which would subsequently form a foundation for the emergence of second wave feminism in Australia in the early second half of the twentieth century. Using Foucauldian notions of the way power works in modern western societies, the thesis traces the relative contributions of the authorities responsible for shaping girls and of the girls themselves to the emergence of a new discourse of girlhood by 1945. The thesis focuses on six qualities of girlhood recognised by both authorities and girls by the end of the war. It demonstrates the way these qualities challenged the idea of girl the authorities had at the beginning of the war even while girls were coming to see the same qualities as part of girlhood. It also charts the developing acceptance by Australian society of these qualities as part of femininity. To do this it looks at the way reading was understood by wartime authorities as a tool for shaping the ideal social subject. The thesis also, through reader response and memory theory, deploys memories of reading as an instrument which allows the researcher to uncover how girls themselves understood their relationship to the world and to others. In order to do this it draws on a specially constructed archive of the memories of both authoritatively approved and disapproved wartime reading as it was experienced by one hundred and thirty two women. These women were girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen at some time during the second world war.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of slag evolution on BOF dephosphorisation</field><field name="creator">Swinnerton, Mark</field><field name="description">A study has been conducted to examine the influence of slag evolution on BOF dephosphorisation. An experimental technique was developed where slag/metal emulsion samples were obtained from the BOF during processing. The observed evolution of slag composition was consistent with many previous studies, where in the first half of the blow slags high in (%SiO2) and low in (%FeO) are generated. During the second half of the oxygen blow, (FeO) generation and lime dissolution improve the slag basicity and contribute to the transfer of phosphorus from metal to slag. Poor levels of phosphorus removal during the centre region of the blow were found to coincide with a minimum in the (%FeO) composition. By the end of blow, 70% of the mass of phosphorus in the furnace is present in the slag, and the extent of phosphorus removal is proportional to the slag basicity and the (%FeO) concentration in the slag. By utilizing mass balance calculations to estimate the mass of slag in the furnace, it was shown that at tap, approximately 30% of lime and 50% of magnesia remain undissolved in a liquid slag saturated in both components. It was concluded that the mass of lime added to the furnace could be reduced without influencing the dissolved concentration of (%CaO), and therefore without deteriorating the extent of dephosphorisation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the potential role of functional foods in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease</field><field name="creator">Patch, Craig Stewart</field><field name="description">Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single largest cause of death and disability in most modern western societies and poor diet is a significant risk factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. Despite significant advances in the treatment of CHD, effective primary prevention approaches remain elusive largely due to the difficulty of sustaining significant and long term dietary changes. In this doctoral program, the hypothesis that the use of functional foods is an effective strategy in the primary prevention of this lifestyle disease was examined. Methodological approaches grounded in the field of nutrition science and behavioural psychology, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative studies were used. Results of a dietary trial in 25 patients, reflective of &#65533;free-living&#65533; clinical practice conditions, found that a functional food-led intervention using plant sterol enriched margarine was an effective approach in the management of hypercholesterolemia. Sixty percent of subjects counselled on the inclusion of 25g per day of plant sterols achieved (greater than) 15% reduction in total serum cholesterol, compared to none receiving standard dietary advice. In another dietary trial that was a randomised placebo controlled dietary intervention with parallel groups, 86 overweight, but otherwise healthy, subjects where asked to choose at least eight serves per day from a selection of either long chain omega-3 fatty acid (LCn-3) enriched foods (~125 mg LCn-3 per serve) or matched control foods. After six-months, participants were able to increase their dietary LCn-3 intake 4-fold (to ~1200 mg/day) and this was confirmed by a corresponding increase in the erythrocyte LCn-3 levels by 20%. This has implications for CHD reduction given the importance of dietary LCn-3. Consumer and social research also suggest that functional foods can have an important role in public health. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework for a study examining prediction of intention to use n-3 enriched functional foods, using a purpose designed questionnaire and follow up of recorded intake. Regression analysis was able to show that the model was a significant predictor of intention (R2 = 0.725, P (less than) 0.001) and to a lesser extent behaviour (R(superscript 2) = 0.298, P (less than) 0.001). Attitude was significantly positively associated with intention, whereas subjective norms and control beliefs were not. These results imply that the best prospects for modifying behaviour are likely to come through a change in attitude. Beliefs and attitudes of key influencers are a significant determinant of consumer attitude. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (e.g. nutrition professionals, scientists, regulators, media personnel and food industry representatives) revealed there are a number of areas of agreement in their attitudes towards functional foods, including the need for safety, taste, bioactivity and extensive evidence for claims. Divergent views were expressed in relation to the regulation of health claims and the levels of evidence required substantiating these claims. A strong feature of the areas of disagreement was lack of clear scientific evidence available to form opinions, and stakeholders often relied on pre-existing ideology. These differing views may impact negatively on consumer attitude to the use of functional foods. In conclusion, analysis of clinical and consumer research suggests that use of functional foods can be an effective preventative health strategy for CHD as long as the maintenance of positive consumer confidence can be achieved.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confronting the challenges of tidal flat conservation:  spatial patterns and human impacts in a marine protected area in southern NSW, Australia</field><field name="creator">Winberg, Pia C</field><field name="description">One of the solutions that has been advocated to reduce anthropogenic impacts in the marine environment, is the concept of a global representative network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The concept seeks to address both conservation and natural resource (eg. fisheries) management, and in Australia, the introduction of MPAs is guided by comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) principles. At a local scale however, we face the challenge of identifying areas that collectively fulfil the goals of MPAs when we don&#8217;t have enough ecological information. This is due to in part to limited knowledge, but is also a result of poor translation of knowledge into the applied realm of management. Consequently, effective MPAs are difficult to plan and balance against diverse stakeholder needs in a political climate. Therefore, it is recognised that ecological science must play an integral part in the development of effective MPAs. In this study, I used MPA zoning in NSW, Australia, as a large scale experiment, to test the effect of no-take zone protection in tidal flat habitat, and also to assess whether the conservation management decisions achieved the MPA goal of representativeness for tidal flat habitat. As bait-harvesting practices for the crustacean Trypaea australiensis (callinassidae) would cease following the zoning of a marine protected area, I sought to address four key aims. First, to describe relevant spatial patterns of tidal flat biodiversity, to assess the representativeness of the tidal flat in a bioregional context, to determine what the impact of bait harvesting was as a structuring process, and finally to determine the effectiveness of no-take zoning for tidal flat habitat and the potential for recovery of the assemblage. I used a hierarchy of spatially nested scales to sample and test the spatial patterns of tidal flat faunal assemblages, and to determine if the macrofaunal diversity of the protected tidal flat was representative of other tidal flats in the bioregion. This study documents the first recovery trajectory for tidal flat assemblages in a marine protected area. There was an increase in abundance and homogeneity of smaller, less mobile, suspension and deposit feeding species. In contrast, some of the more mobile, predatory and or scavenging species decreased in abundance. This assemblage shift has the potential for further trophic or functional effects beyond the boundaries of the tidal flat, which are discussed, and thus provides important guidance for future research. I also found that macrofaunal assemblages were patchily distributed, being most heterogeneous at the scale of 100s m within the tidal flat. For planning and management this implies that whole habitat is required in no-take zones, in order to encompass the full range of macrofaunal diversity in the habitat. In addition to the key findings, the methods used in this study extended asymmetrical ANOVA to incorporate temporally and spatially asymmetrical factors simultaneously. This extension increases the power and thereby the sensitivity of univariate analysis, to detect environmental change for MPA or impact studies. In addition, data manipulations (taxonomic resolution, assemblage sub-sets and data transformations) demonstrated some dramatic effects on the interpretation of biological pattern. This study demonstrate the opportunity of using MPA management decisions as a basis on which to test ecological predictions, as well as provide outcomes that can be applied to adaptive planning and management for MPA goals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/123</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"What men ought to be": masculinities in Jane Austen's novels</field><field name="creator">Ailwood, Sarah</field><field name="description">&#8220; &#8216;What men ought to be&#8217;: Masculinities in Jane Austen&#8217;s Novels&#8221; examines Jane Austen&#8217;s literary constructions of men and masculinity as feminine and feminist contributions to the public debate on ideal English masculinity throughout the Romantic period.  It explores the problematic position of women writers in critiquing masculinity in the highly politicised context of the Romantic period and develops a theoretical approach to interpreting their constructions of desirable and undesirable masculinities as being representative of their social, cultural and feminist concerns.  Throughout her novels, Jane Austen&#8217;s representations of the desirable male &#8211; of &#8216;what men ought to be&#8217; &#8211; are informed by her fundamental concerns regarding the realisation of female selfhood and the fulfilment of women&#8217;s desires, and the political survival and moral wellbeing of the English nation.  This thesis argues that Austen&#8217;s novels seek to reform socially-approved codes of gentry masculinity by endorsing a model of male identity that is not dependent on the submission or passivity of women in courtship or domestic relationships, promoted by conventional patriarchal ideologies.  Austen&#8217;s novel&#8217;s dramatise the process by which men can choose to forge a masculine identity that allows women a greater socially and publicly participatory role, both enabling the fulfilment of female desire and ensuring the security and wellbeing of the English nation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/124</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of 2-DOF haptic devices working with magnetorheological fluids</field><field name="creator">Liu, Bin</field><field name="description">The thesis presents the design and development of a 2-DOF (degree of freedom) magnetorheological (MR) fluid based haptic joystick and studies its applications in virtual reality. MR fluids are controllable fluids that can generate adaptable resistance forces when subjected to a magnetic field. This feature is capable of realizing novel haptic devices. The developed system consists of three main parts: MR joystick, control and display hardware, and software. The MR joystick is constructed of two disc-shaped MR actuators positioned perpendicularly with a gimbal structure, which transfers the movement of the joystick handle into two actuator rotary movements. Therefore, operators can feel the resisting force generated by the two actuators. The dimensions of the actuators have been optimized using finite element analysis, and the steady-state performance of the actuators has been measured and analyzed. The kinetics of the joystick in terms of working space and resistance will be discussed. In the thesis, a subhysteresis model and a torque converting method will be employed to enhance the accuracy of the force control. The applications of the MR joystick in virtual reality will be demonstrated by using six typical interface examples designed in LabVIEW. These demonstrations show that the MR haptic devices have a huge application potential in entertainment, medical, and general industry fields.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conventional versus computer-based administration of measures of cognitive ability: an analysis of psychometric, behavioural, experiential and relativity of equivalence</field><field name="creator">Smith, Brooke L</field><field name="description">Test equivalence can be evaluated in terms of four aspects: psychometric, behavioural, experiential and individual differences (i.e., relativity of equivalence) (Honaker, 1988). This thesis comprises two studies designed to explore the equivalency of scores obtained on conventional versus computerised measures of cognitive ability in terms of all four criteria. In addition, this thesis provides theoretical clarification of the link between computer anxiety and performance. This objective was achieved by developing a theoretical model for exploring the effect of computer anxiety on computer based test (CBT) performance and test equivalence. The first study was conducted in an organisational setting and employed a repeated-measures mixed design to examine the equivalency of two Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel selection tests. Hence, the first study was divided into two phases. Phase 1 of Study 1 examined the equivalence of Test MX, a multiple-choice test of simple mathematics, using data from a sample of 685 ADF applicants. Phase 2 explored the equivalence of Test C, a timed clerical aptitude test, based on test score information from 781 ADF applicants. Study 2, on the other hand, was conducted in an educational setting and employed 180 undergraduate students to examine the equivalency of the Australian Council for Education Research Quantitative Test (ACER-AQ). Psychometrically, the results of Study 1 showed that scores obtained on the conventional and computerised versions of Test MX and Test C were not equivalent. Although similarities in rankings were found across the computer and conventional tests, the results demonstrated that the two formats differed in terms of mean scale scores, dispersion, and distribution of scores. From a behavioural perspective, differential speededness and/or omit patterns were found across the conventional and computerised versions of Test MX and Test C. Moreover, the results of Study 1 suggest that the two administration modes were not experientially equivalent. However, these experiential differences did not affect computer-conventional equivalency. With respect to relativity of equivalence, the results of Study 1 indicated that scores from the two formats did not vary as a function of the individual characteristics of interest (i.e., test anxiety, trait anxiety, state anxiety, computer anxiety, computer experience, computer thoughts). In extending theory and research on computer anxiety, the results of Study 1 provided some support for the theoretical model proposed by demonstrating that computer thoughts mediated the main effect of computer anxiety on CBT performance. In contrast, Study 2 employed a four-group, counterbalanced, repeated-measures design to examine the equivalency of the ACER-AQ in terms of all four equivalency criteria. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that the conventional and computerised formats of the ACER-AQ were equivalent in terms of psychometric and individual difference aspects. However, the two forms differed in terms of behavioural and experiential aspects. Taken together, the present findings suggest that test-taking behaviour and experiential factors need to be examined as potential sources of construct-irrelevant variance in computer-based testing. Practical and empirical implications for computer-based assessment are discussed. In addition, future research opportunities and theoretical developments pertaining to the computer anxiety-performance linkage are considered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/165</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Austenite grain size on hot ductility of steels</field><field name="creator">Moon, Suk-Chun</field><field name="description">The high temperature ductility of steel increases as the grain size is decreased. However, in microalloyed steels this interdependence of grain size and hot-ductility is generally less pronounced because of the overriding effect of precipitation of carbo-nitrides of alloying elements at grain boundaries. Nevertheless, many types of crack have been shown to be associated with coarse austenite grains, and the tendency to crack is reduced when the formation of coarse austenite grains is prevented by the use of suitable secondary cooling. To our knowledge, a systematic study, to isolate the contribution of grain size on hot-ductility has not been reported and hence, under these circumstances, it is important to define clearly the contributing role of grains size to hot-ductility and therefore it is necessary to separate the effect on hot ductility of microalloying precipitates from that of grain size. The materials used for study were Fe-0.05%C, Fe-0.18%C and Fe-0.45%C alloys, prepared in an experimental facility. Carbon was the only alloying element deliberately added to the melt and tramp elements and impurities were kept to as low a value as experimentally possible. A GLEEBLE 3500 thermomechanical simulator was used to conduct hot-tensile tests and from these results the relationship between austenite grain size and hot-ductility could be determined. The hot-ductility tensile tests in this study were performed in the temperature range 1100 to 700 degrees celsius. Hot-tensile test specimens were either solution treated or melted in-situ (direct cast) and cooled to the test temperature in order to simulate the microstructural characteristics of commercially as-cast slab which contains coarse austenite grains at the base of oscillation marks. In order to obtain different grain sizes, the specimens were solution treated at temperatures between 1100 degrees celsius and 1350 degrees celsius for 10minutes. The specimens were then rapidly cooled to the test temperature, in the range 1100 degrees celsius to 700 degrees celsius at a rate of 200 degrees celsius min (superscript &#65533;1) and then pulled to fracture at a low strain rate of 7.5&#65533;10(superscript &#65533;4)s(superscript &#65533;1). Specimens that were cast in-situ (referred to as the &#65533;direct casting condition&#65533;) were cooled at rates of 100 degrees Celsius min (superscript &#65533;1) and 200 degrees Celsius min-1 respectively in order to study the effect of cooling rate on hot ductility. It was found that grain size increased almost linearly with increasing solution treatment temperature in all the Fe-C alloys and in case of specimens solution treated at 1350 degrees celsius an average austenite grain size of ~4mm in diameter was obtained. Increasing the grain size resulted in ductility loss under all testing conditions. The existence of a ductility trough between Ar(subscript 3) and Ae(subscript 3) temperature was considered to be due to the formation of deformation induced ferrite as evidenced by a constant peak stress region between these two temperatures. However, convincing experimental evidence of the ductility trough extending beyond the Ae(subscript 3) temperature well into the austenite was found. The mechanism of this interesting, and important observation for low carbon alloy below 0.3%C has not been explored as yet and at present it has to be assumed that it is related to the occurrence of grain boundary sliding because in the high austenite temperature region the grain boundary sliding is favored in a coarse grained structure. For specimens cast in-situ, the largest grains were found in the Fe-0.18%C alloy for both cooling rates. This important observation is attributed to the higher austenitizing temperature of a Fe-0.18%C alloy compared to that of the other Fe-C alloys studied. Moreover, the formation of columnar austenite grains were observed in this alloy on cooling, whereas equi-axed grains were formed in the other two Fe-C alloys. By such columnarization, the surface cracking susceptibility of the peritectic grade steel will be accelerated. The hot-ductility of the Fe-C alloy of near-peritectic composition was the lowest of the alloys studied and the inferior ductility in this alloy is attributed to the coarse grain size and columnar shape of the grains. The Fe-0.45%C alloy had the smallest grain size at any specimens cast in-situ but the hot-ductility was much lower than would have been expected in an alloy of such small grain size. This much reduced ductility may be due to increased grain boundary sliding. At a higher cooling rate of the in-situ melted specimens, smaller grains were produced in all the Fe-C alloys resulting in ductility improvement. This grain refinement obtained at higher cooling rates have important implications for near-net shape casting operations such as thin-slab casting or strip-casting where much higher cooling rates are realized than in the conventional casting process, if the factors related with precipitation are removed. An important insight derived at through this study was that enlarged grain contributed more to reduced ductility at high temperature than did cast structure, at least under the pertaining experimental conditions. This observation has important practical implications because it means that efforts in industry could be concentrated on reducing the chances of forming large austenite grains, such as at the roots of oscillation marks due to a decreased cooling rate, without undue regard to the effect of these measures on cast structure. This study has provided convincing new experimental evidence of the extremely detrimental effect of large austenite grains on hot-ductility in plain carbon steels. The very large columnar shaped grains that can form in alloys of near-peritectic composition is particularly disconcerting. However, the influence of AlN precipitation on austenite grain boundaries on hot-ductility was not studied and it is recommended that this important topic should be included in subsequent investigation. The experimental data on these Fe-C alloys, provided in this study, may now be used to benchmark and further analyse the much larger body of information on low-alloyed steels available in the literature.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The asymmetric synthesis of polyfunctional pyrrolidine alkaloids and their analogues</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Karl B</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to develop a flexible asymmetric synthesis of 1-aza-[2+n.3.0] bicyclic ring systems (n=1,2,3). This was accomplished by the aminolysis of chiral vinyl epoxides followed by ring closing metathesis of the resulting dienes to give a 2,5-dihydropyrroles. These 2,5-dihydropyrroles were very versatile and could readily be converted to the desired 1-azabicyclic ring structures. Further elaboration to natural products was also possible. To this end the synthesis of the indolizidine alkaloid (-)-swainsonine has been developed via two distinct approaches. Furthermore, the (+)-1,2-di-epi- and (+)-1,2,8-tri-epi-swainsonine analogues were prepared using similar methods. The first example of a trihydroxy-pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine was also prepared. Our efforts to apply the same synthetic approach to the Stemona alkaloids led to the successful synthesis of a pyrrolo-butyrolactone model system. Attempts to elaborate the same methods to the total synthesis of (+)-croomine, were restricted by the extremly hindered nature of the amino-diene core. Nevertheless the BC ring system of (+)-croomine was constructed, and the synthesis proceeded as far as the triol 334 which was, in principle, only three synthetic steps from (+)-croomine. Regrettably transformation of this advanced intermediate into (+)-croomine could not be achieved in the time available.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The women's voluntary services, a study of war and volunteering in Camden, 1939-1945</field><field name="creator">Willis, Ian C</field><field name="description">Camden is a country town whose history and development has been influenced by war. The town was part of Australias homefront war effort, and from the time of the Boer War the most important part of this for Camden was volunteering. The Second World War was no exception, and the most influential voluntary organisation that contributed to the town&#65533;s war effort was the Womens Voluntary Services [WVS]. The Camden WVS was part of the close cultural and emotional links that existed between Camden and Great Britain that began with the Macarthur family in the early nineteenth century. Camden saw itself as a little England and the WVS used this feeling to great effect during the war, stressing notions of home and a shared sense of identity and place with Britain. The Camden WVS was part of a strong tradition of Victorian female philanthropy in the town, which attracted, and depended on, middle class women socialised in Victorian notions of service, ideals of dependence, a separatedness of spheres, patriarchy, the status quo, and by the inter-war period, modernity. Although the WVS was created specifically to meet the needs generated by the Second World War, it shared the characteristics of a number of British organisations that were established within Camdens female philanthropy by the female elite after 1900. These organisations did not compete with each other, and were characterised by overlapping membership, inter-organisational co-operation, conservatism, Protestantism, leadership by the Camden elite and a decentralised branch network. All of which was underpinned by parochialism. The women who founded these voluntary organisations gained valuable wartime experience from their efforts during the Boer and First World Wars, and this contributed to the eventual success of WVS in the town. In essence, the Camden WVS was a war-specific British voluntary organisation that connected with Camdens Anglo-centric heritage and cultural origins. The central doctrine of the WVS was an ethos of service, which was based on altruism, imperial patriotism and British nationalism. Volunteering for the WVS, which involved self-sacrifice and dedication to duty, directed Camdens tradition of female philanthropy towards the moral imperative of a righteous war. Camden women willingly undertook voluntary service for the WVS in the belief that they gave their time and effort to help their boys, and in doing so, did their bit for the war effort. Its influence was great enough to spill over into many other aspects of Camdens war effort, including those run by the men of the town. This study of the WVS has allowed the teasing out of some of the main threads of Camdens wartime experience. In the process it has also illustrated that wartime philanthropy was bound up with class, gender expectations, intimacy, conservatism, patriarchy, parochialism (localism) and Camdens rural ideology. Deeply embedded in Camden, the WVS reflected its community.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extending an MPEG-21 viewer to manage access rights</field><field name="creator">Lonneborg, Rickard</field><field name="description">The Internet has opened many opportunities for the distribution of information, both free and copyrighted. A music album is quickly transferred with high quality between Internet users, peer-to-peer networks enable simple trading and redistribution of copyrighted music, video and programs. Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems are designed to enable legal trading of copyrighted information, prevent unauthorised distribution, modification and usage of copyrighted digital information. MPEG-21 is a new standard for multimedia on the Internet. It is described as being the big picture in describing multimedia content. It allows for composition of digital items from different resources such as pictures, sound, etc. This standard is still under development by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG). MPEG-21 Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP) is a framework for enabling DRM in MPEG-21. IPMP enables a MPEG-21 terminal to communicate through messaging with various IPMP-tools to protect MPEG-21 content. A Rights Expression Language is a language capable of describing users rights to some digital information. One part of MPEG-21 is the Rights Expression Language, which will be based on The eXtensible rights Markup Language. The SMICL viewer is a viewer for MPEG-21; it is under development and is supposed to be a research platform for security related research. In this thesis we review some of the current systems for DRM and present some Rights Expression Languages. Further we describe MPEG-21 and the SMICL viewer and its architecture. We discuss refinements of the IPMP messaging for the SMICLV viewer and the required behaviour of a rights enforcing IPMP tool. Finally we provide an implementation of a rights enforcing IPMP tool for the SMICL viewer, and propose future extensions for the SMICL viewer and the rights enforcing tool.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel approaches to the analysis of pathogenic bacterial populations in neonatal and weaner porcine colibacillosis</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Toni</field><field name="description">Exploiting the concept that pathogenic and commensal Escherichia coli strains can be distinguished on the basis of housekeeping enzymes by MLEE, a panel of 58 virulence genes was used to analyse the phylogenetic relationship between commensal E. coli and pathogenic E. coli from clinical cases of porcine neonatal and post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD). Of the 58 virulence genes examined, 17 (STb, iha, hlyA, STa, aidA, F18, east1, LT, fimH, iroNE.coli, aah, F4, traT, F41, F5, saa and stx2) were able to differentiate between the groups of isolates based on Chi-squared analysis. Application of two other statistical methods; an agglomerative hierarchical algorithm and principle coordinate analysis (PCO) to the isolates resulted in a relational depiction consisting of a branching tree dendrogram and point-clustering respectively. In both situations, member clones designated as commensals and pathogens were separated from each other. However, commensal and neonatal diarrhoea (ND) isolates tended to be more similar to each other and together, more different from post-weaning diarrhoea clones.The observation that individual post-weaning and commensal clones could be segregated suggested that a similar approach based on an analysis of many clones from healthy and scouring weaners may be able to distinguish pigs on their health status. This was successfully tested by analysis of virulence gene profiles of representative subset populations of E. coli recovered from individual animal samples using a replicating machine to entrap bacteria on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMF). This method referred to as population based microbial analysis (PoMA) provided a reliable tool to distinguish between clinical, subclinical and healthy pigs. PoMA was used to determine the population virulence gene profile, generating a host profile for each individual pig. Using the 58 virulence genes analysed, 13 (LT, aah, aidA, cvaC, STb, STa, bmaE, papC, iroNE.coli, papG allele I&#8217;, ehxA, cdt &amp; F18) could be used to distinguish between the two groups of piglets (based on Chi-squared analysis). Further statistical analysis to generate a cluster dendrogram, and principle coordinate (PCO) analysis revealed segregation of isolates based on health status (healthy and scouring separated into different groupings). When extended to a group of subclinical animals, the method also successfully clustered these in between the healthy and scouring weaners by principle coordinate analysis PoMA has the hallmarks of a statistically reliable diagnostic tool for the analysis of clinical samples from individual animals, pools of animals and even, pools of samples from different farms for comparative analysis.When applied to newborn piglets with neonatal diarrhoea, PoMA replication on CHROMAgar Orientation medium successfully identified the presence of an unreported population of enterococci that dominated on culture media intended to recover primarily E. coli. Selection of single clones followed by enumeration revealed elevated numbers of enterococci in scouring neonates compared to healthy piglets with E. faecium present at a similar ratio to E. faecalis whilst none of the latter was present in the enterococci isolated from healthy piglets. Since antibiotic resistance of enterococci has recently gained eminence as a threat to human health and because microbial contamination from pig meat can also enter the human food chain, an analysis of porcine enterococci isolates was carried out to compare their virulence genes and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles to clinical human enterococci isolates. The porcine strains had similar virulence genes to human isolates but fortuitously, none of the isolates examined so far in this thesis contained the vanA or vanB genes for vancomycin resistance. A role for enterococci in neonatal diarrhoea remains to be elucidated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable socio-economic development in Tonga: challenges and responses</field><field name="creator">Fisi'iahi, Fotukaehiko Valeli</field><field name="description">Achieving good progress towards sustainable socio-economic development is a major issue for all developing countries, but it presents special challenges for small island economies. Tonga, a small island kingdom in the Pacific, is no exception. While Tonga is blessed with many human and physical resources, its remoteness, small size, and uneven progress have hampered sustainable socio-economic development.There are also internal attributes, which, while manageable, constrain the country&#8217;s socio-economic development. The thesis sought to provide answers to two important questions. Firstly, what has hindered or limited the sustainable socio-economic development of Tonga? Secondly, how can these challenges be addressed? These questions were identified in this thesis to be important, especially in light of the sluggish socioeconomic performance of the Tongan economy in recent years.In order to identify the most important factors, a comprehensive study of the barriers to entrepreneurship development in Tonga (published by Deacon Ritterbush in 1986) was reviewed, and compared with the barriers and problems that are still evident or recently identified in the 21st century.Three important issues were found to have considerable impact on the process of sustainable socio-economic development in Tonga. Drawing on qualitative research methods, the prime issues investigated were &#8216;weak governance&#8217; in family-run businesses and public enterprises, &#8216;market deficiencies&#8217;, and thirdly, the lack of an employment relations framework, and concomitant lack of &#8216;decent work&#8217;.If Tonga is to reach its potential, commitment is needed from the Tongan government, as well as from Tongan citizens, to give priority to good governance, to reduce marketing problems, and to ensure wide availability of &#8216;decent work&#8217; and effective employment relations legislation. This is not to undermine the policies already put in place by the government. Rather the findings of this thesis emphasise the importance of adopting appropriate and affordable policies and strategies in a coherent and timely manner for the benefit of the current and future generations of the people of Tonga.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the relationship between governance, decision-making, and school effectiveness: a case study of four high schools</field><field name="creator">Mohajeran, Behnaz</field><field name="description">The Purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between governance, decision-making, and particular indicators of school effectiveness: parental involvement, professional development of teachers, planning and budgeting, facilities and resources and student outcomes. The study focused on the Principal, teachers, parents, and students of four high schools in the Wollongong area of NSW. The schools represented different governance arrangements: one government; one independent Catholic; one independent Christian parent-controlled; one Catholic systemic. Each school represented a case study in which was applied mixed-method research utilising quantitative and qualitative approaches including questionnaire, semi-structured interview and document review.The results indicate similar approaches to and constraints on governance/decisionmaking across the four schools. An apparent relationship between type of governance and school effectiveness was not established. Different governance structures were not shown to have major impact on different school effectiveness indicators.However, a clear finding was that the Principal is central to the management and direction of decision-making in the school more so than any factors or differences there may be in other aspects of governance. It is not just the structural and hierarchical aspects of the Principal&#8217;s role that is important, but how he or she directs and manages school governance.The centrality of the Principals in these schools, the way they perceived and enacted their roles both generally and in relation to the roles of other stakeholders, and their participation in school decision-making, were thus critical in the governance of their schools.The findings of this study, as of other studies, were inconclusive on relationships between other structural governance factors and school effectiveness indicators, and suggest that the Principal's impact on such indicators as student outcomes may be significant but indirect. The study findings do, however support other findings on the importance of the Principal's role &#8211; their perception of it and the roles of others related to it, their personal and professional capabilities, and the extent to which they lead and involve others collaboratively in school governance and decision-making.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Highly scalable wavelet image and video coding for transmission over heterogeneous networks</field><field name="creator">Danyali, Habibollah</field><field name="description">Rapid advances in networking technologies and the explosive growth of the Internet in recent years have increasingly raised the heterogeneity issue (in end-users processing capabilities and access bandwidth) for transmission of visual information. The traditional approach of providing multiple bitstreams, each tailored for one class of decoding requirements to address the heterogeneity issue is very inefficient and only covers very limited classes of end-users. Scalable coding that generates a bitstream which consists of a set of embedded parts that offer increasingly better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or spatial and/or temporal resolution, is widely considered as a promising coding approach for image/video transmission in heterogeneous environments. This thesis presents a family of highly scalable wavelet-based image and video coding systems based on the powerful set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm. A framework for highly scalable SPIHT (HS-SPIHT) coding is first introduced. The main idea is to separately encode each level of the spatial resolution subbands in the wavelet decomposed image to achieve spatial scalability, while benefiting from the tree structure and the efficient set partitioning rule defined by SPIHT to preserve the compression efficiency. In this framework two novel algorithms, HS-SPIHT-I and HS-SPIHT-II, are proposed. Both algorithms fully support SNR and spatial scalability for image coding and output flexible bitstreams that are easily parsable (reorderable) for providing full embedded subbitstreams for lower resolutions. It is shown that the HS-SPIHT approach does not sacrifice compression efficiency for providing scalability features. The HS-SPIHT coding approach is extended to 3-D (3DHS-SPIHT) to provide combined SNR, spatial and temporal scalability support for video coding. An accurate motion compensation temporal filtering (MCTF) scheme is employed in the proposed highly scalable video coding system to achieve not only more efficient compression but also to produce clear, blur-free sequences for lower temporal resolutions. Simulation results prove the compression efficiency and full scalability support of the proposed video coding system. An object-based modification of HS-SPIHT (OBHS-SPIHT) for highly scalable texture coding of arbitrarily shaped image objects is also presented. It effectively encodes only the decomposed object texture, while it keeps the full scalability functionality of the HS-SPIHT. A non expansive shape adaptive discrete wavelet transform (SA-DWT) is utilized for decomposing the texture information of the object. The OBHS-SPIHT is also extended to 3-D for video object coding. The compression efficiency of the OBHS-SPIHT approach in comparison to the state-of-the-art object-based coding algorithms, as well as its full scalability feature, are shown in the simulation results. Full scalability support and object-based functionality of the proposed highly scalable image and video coding approaches with their compression efficiency and low complexity (which makes them very convenient for software implementation), make them attractive for many multimedia applications. This is especially so for multicasting visual information over heterogenous networks and object-based visual information storage, processing and retrieval systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface coatings for 3-piece freight bogie centre bearings</field><field name="creator">Franklin, Matthew J</field><field name="description">The research is divided into four related sections of work.

The worn dimensions of the AISI 1053 steel, Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components were determined. The wear of the high density polyethylene centre bowl liner was negligible. The rim wall wear of the unlubricated steel components was greatest in the longitudinal direction, whilst there was negligible wear in the lateral direction. The average wear depth rate for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was approximately twice that of the Hadfield steel centre bowl liner. The cross-sectional microhardness and microstructure of one worn AISI 1053 steel top centre and two worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners were determined. The worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners showed significant near surface work hardening. The wear mechanism for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was plastic strain accumulation in conjunction with low cycle fatigue. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 molybdenum steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 &#61616;C using 75% N2: 25% H2 mixture gas for 5 hours. The microstructures of the coatings were determined using optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The treated samples were characterised using x-ray diffraction and vi microhardness. The optimum condition for this material was achieved at the temperature of 500 0C. Stellite 6 multi-track layers were laser clad onto mild and AISI 4016 steel substrates with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at 1800 W laser source power using four different processing speeds: 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 mm/min. The laser power, defocused laser spot size, and powder feed rate were held constant. The clad samples were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Microhardness profiles of the clad layers and heat affected zones were determined. For both substrates the optimum processing speed is between 600 and 900 mm/min. Wear testing of Hadfield pin - AISI 1053 steel plate, Hadfield pin - untreated AISI 4016 steel plate, HDPE pin &#8211; Hadfield steel plate, Hadfield pin - plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate, and Hadfield pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs was conducted using the pin-on-plate reciprocating wear test method. The wear test conditions provided a good simulation of the rim wall operating conditions for the Hadfield steel pin &#8211; plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate and Hadfield steel pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs. The Hadfield steel pin &#8211; nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate material pair had the lowest wear under these wear test conditions, whilst it&#8217;s co-efficient of friction of 0.57 would make it suitable for use in lightly loaded (50 ton wagon mass) 3-piece freight bogies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating and sustaining a new school: the challenges and the issues</field><field name="creator">Nicholas, Zeffie</field><field name="description">New schools open in Australia on a relatively frequent basis. However, there is little literature to inform the establishment phase of a new school. The literature that does exist suggests that new schools begin in a frenetic way. There is much excitement about possibilities and such schools appear to be places where all dreams are possible. Yet the literature has documented that they revert to the norm.  This thesis presents a case study of a secondary school during the first two years of its establishment. Specifically it focuses on the challenges and issues that foundation and second year staff faced when establishing a new school. During the first two years of the school&#8217;s establishment I was the foundation curriculum coordinator, hence my role is that of participant observer. The purpose of the study was to document the establishment phase of a new school from the perspective of an &#8216;insider&#8217; and hence relate the issues and challenges that face staff during this critical period. It was hoped that the results might contribute to the literature in the area. The second was to establish what structures are vital when establishing a new school that would result in sustainable practice.This study employed a method of case study design, and data collection included interviews with all foundation and second year staff, and analyses of observation journal and school archival documentation. Data analysis occurred in three distinct stages and was informed by Carney&#8217;s Analytical Ladder of Abstraction (1990). Stage 1 involved sourcing appropriate research on which initial themes could be identified. This search resulted in only a few documented case studies on new schools and several anecdotal descriptions. Stage 1 also involved an analysis of the observation journal to identify issues and themes at the case study school. This resulted in what is termed within this study as internal and external level forces that were in existence in the new school setting. As research in the area of new schools was modest, Stage 2 of the process involved sourcing appropriate literature on which to further the study. The assumption was made early that a new school would be designed based on an effective school. Hence, literature in the areas of school effectiveness, school improvement, school reform and sustainability were used. These areas of educational research promised knowledge about not only what constitutes an effective school, but also how a school can become and be sustained as an effective school. A synthesis of this literature resulted in a set of new school design characteristics. This literature also indicated that major educational change and reform innovations are conducted without a theory base of a process. Stage 3 involved an analysis of participant interviews and school documentation, and a comparison of these findings against the internal and external level forces and the new school design characteristics. During the time that the school has been in existence there has been only one Principal. The school&#8217;s original vision embraced principles of a middle school philosophy. The initial structures in terms of pastoral care and curriculum were to be based on these philosophies. After ten years some practices were sustained at the school. Primarily these structures were to do with pastoral care. The curriculum structures have not been sustained but during a recent follow-up interview with the Principal there was an indication that the initial philosophies were being revisited and attempts made to adopt appropriate middle school practices again. The findings of this study revealed challenges and issues in regards to eight critical structures, they were: vision and philosophy; effective decision-making and communication; basic managerial functioning; the wider community; appropriate professional development; clear role definitions; support of staff; and appropriate future planning. Also, the comparison of these eight structures against the internal and external level forces and the new school design characteristics resulted in an integrated set of new school design characteristics. By utilising the most recent literature in the area of comprehensive school reform, principles of design were also developed. The principles provide a framework by which the design principles would be enacted. The design principles refer to: the school as a human system, the clear articulation and acceptance of a vision; a design for the school; rules that govern practice that are specific, comprehensive, coherent and consistent; practices that are implicit and embedded; appropriate, consistent and emergent feedback; support of staff; and structures that disperse control and authority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual manipulation</field><field name="creator">Dong, Shen</field><field name="description">An empirical research on developing a new paradigm for programming a robotics manipulator to perform complex constrained motion tasks is carried out in this thesis. The teaching of the manipulation skills to the machine commences by demonstrating those skills in a haptic-rendered virtual environment. This is in contrast to conventional approach in which a robotics manipulator is programmed to perform a particular task. A manipulation skill consists of a number of basic skills that, when sequenced and integrated, can perform a desired manipulation task. By manipulation means the ability to transfer, physically transform or mate a part with another part. Haptic-rendering augments the effectiveness of computer simulation by providing force feedback for the user. This increases the quality of human &#65293; computer interaction and provides an attractive augmentation to visual display and significantly enhances the level of immersion in a virtual environment. The study is conducted based on the peg-in-hole application as it concisely represents a constrained motion-force-sensitive manufacturing task with all the attendant issues of jamming, tight clearances, and the need for quick assembly times, reliability, etc. The state recognition approach is used to identify and classify the skills acquired from the virtual environment. A human operator demonstrates both good and bad examples of the desired behaviour in the haptic virtual environment. Position and contact force and torque ii data, as well as orientation generated in the virtual environment, combined with a priori knowledge about the task, are used to identify and learn the skills in the newly demonstrated tasks and then to reproduce them in the robotics system. The robot evaluates the controller&#8217;s performance and thus learns the best way to produce that behaviour. The data obtained from the virtual environment is classified into different cluster sets using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Fuzzy Gustafson&#8211;Kessel (FGK) and Competitive Agglomeration (CA) respectively. Each cluster represents a contact state between the peg and the hole. The clusters in the optimum cluster set are tuned using a Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) algorithm to produce prediction models for robot trajectory performing the physical assembly based on the force/position information received from the rig. The significance of the work is highlighted. The approach developed and the outcomes achieved are reported. The development of the haptic-rendered virtual peg-in-hole model and structure of the physical experimental rig are described. The approach is validated though experimental work results are critically evaluated.

According to &#8216;sudden gains&#8217; and &#8216;rapid response&#8217; methods, considerable numbers of patients experience large robust reductions in depression in early sessions across a range of psychotherapeutic modalities. Yet, surprisingly few researchers have investigated the processes that might help explain this phenomenon.Aims. Accordingly, the aims of this thesis were threefold: 1) To replicate previous findings of a rapid response to psychotherapy, 2) To investigate the role of empirically supported pre-existing interpersonal patient factors, 3) To examine systematically the therapeutic processes that characterise both rapid and gradual response profiles.Methods. Sixty-two adults received 16 weekly sessions of supportive-expressive dynamic psychotherapy (Luborsky et al., 1995). A rapid response was defined as a reduction of at least 50% of patients&#8217; intake Beck Depression Inventory score by Week 6. Following a comparison between rapid and gradually responding patients&#8217; attachment and interpersonal patterns, 20 (10 rapid-, 10 gradual-responders&#8217;) early therapy sessions (session 3) were rated with the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set (PQS; Jones, 2000). The PQS is a pan-theoretical method of systematically characterising therapist-patient interactions that provides a meaningful index of process that can be used in comparative analyses.Results. Over one third of patients (23/62) experienced a rapid response, by Session 6. This accounted for an average 96% of their entire symptom reductions. Rapid responders were more than twice as likely to recover by Session 16, and were significantly less depressed at 52 week follow-up, after adjusting for intake symptom levels. Rapid responders also presented with fewer interpersonal problems. On the other hand, pre-therapy characteristics of gradually responding patients included having lower interpersonal mastery, a more domineering interpersonal style, and greater social isolation and attachment fears concerning intimacy.The interpersonal differences between rapid and gradually responding patients were reflected in differences in psychotherapy processes. Despite equivalent ratings of observer-rated working alliance, results from the PQS suggested that as early as Session 3, rapid responders were at a more advanced stage of therapy, characterized by a willingness to work on strong emotions such as guilt. In contrast, gradual responders&#8217; sessions were dominated by externalising, hostility, and defensiveness.Conclusion. Pre-existing interpersonal patient factors determine the speed of recovery in psychotherapy through their differential effects on therapeutic process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstracting from the landscape: a sense of place</field><field name="creator">Gray, Sarah Willard</field><field name="description">In this study I will examine the following question: how is my painting informed by a layered sense of place through a political engagement with the environment?     During this research consideration was given to the origins, techniques and structures of my creative work that was underpinned by the artistic theories and processes I used while painting the landscape of the Hoskins Nature Reserve and the Bong Bong Common. These areas are situated midway between Bowral and Moss Vale on the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and are approximately 120 kms from the first penal colony established at Port Jackson in 1788.       In my thesis I describe the historical background of the protected land and wildlife corridor, Hoskins Nature Reserve, which is managed by N.S.W. Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Bong Bong Common early settlement owned by the Wingecarribee Shire Council. While researching these two historical areas of the Southern Highlands I contacted people with sound environmental and historical knowledge from the NSW Parks and Wildlife rangers at Fitzroy Falls, European representatives from the Aboriginal Reconciliation Group and Dr Kim Leevers through his PhD thesis First Contact/Frontier Expansion in the Wingecarribee area Between 1798 &#8211; 1821: Exploration and Analysis (2006).      The writings of Australian cultural architect Ken Taylor and Canadian philosopher Allen Carlson&#8217;s essay on environmental aesthetics in the Routledge Companion to Aesthetics (2001) were a source of valuable insight into the thesis question.

It argues that while the NGOs acted as classical labour intellectuals in late New Order Indonesia (1989-1998), recognition of that role was circumscribed by prevailing definitions of the labour movement. The study makes a case for redrawing the traditional boundaries of that movement to incorporate other types of organisations concerned with labour. Although it focuses on NGOs that dealt with industrial labour in the specific context of Indonesia in the final decade of the twentieth century, its findings suggest that a similar argument could made about other non-traditional labour movement organisations that deal other groups of workers, such as people employed in the informal sector or overseas migrant labour. The structure and methodology of the study are informed by Foucaults notion of a history of the present and Hymans call to interrogate the criteria of significance on which analyses of industrial relations are based. The thesis examines how definitions of organised labour and the labour movement were historically constructed to exclude intellectuals and non-union organisations. It does so in order to explain why labour NGOs were considered outsiders in the present. The thesis compares accounts of labour history written under the New Order (1967-1998) with those written during the post-Independence period (1945-1965), demonstrating that New Order labour history was a victors history, written to emphasise the working-class composition and the apolitical nature of true labour unions. It then examines two phases in development of labour NGOs: the eight years between 1991, when labour NGOs launched their first major campaign, and 1998, when President Suharto fell from power; and the three years immediately following Suhartos resignation. The developments in the early post Suharto period (1998-2001) brought tensions between NGOs participation in the labour movement and position as non-worker outsiders into sharp relief, demanding we question whether the union centred definitions of the labour movement reflect the contemporary realities of organised labour in Indonesia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A variable radius roll test for measuring the adhesion of paint systems to deformable steel substrates</field><field name="creator">Jinks, Damien</field><field name="description">A test is developed for measuring the adhesion of paint to the deformable metal substrates used as cladding in automotive and building applications, and also in domestic appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines. The test is based on the application of a stiff overlay to the paint consisting of 1-3mm of epoxy resin, and the sample is tested by rolling the substrate away from the overlay using a variable radius roll of well defined radius. No special substrate preparation is required prior to coating allowing for commercial material to be tested. The paint stiffness is not critical to the performance of the test, so the test should better reflect the toughness or adhesion of the paint than other common tests such as T-bend and reverse impact. Experimental studies show that the test has high sensitivity to differences in paint adhesion/cohesion, even when the adhesion is high. Some analysis of the test mechanics is also presented, including FEA studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On rights, duties and vulnerability: assessing the role of human rights in the care and protection of vulnerable people</field><field name="creator">Jones, Tony S</field><field name="description">When we are confronted with vulnerable people, with those groups and individuals who are impaired with respect to their ability to function as the rational, autonomous and moral agents that we typically take humans to be, we are encouraged to invoke notions of rights, and in particular notions of human rights, in order to secure their care and protection. Such an approach seeks not simply to reinforce the view that vulnerable people are the moral equivalents of us all and thus are entitled to an equal moral consideration, but also this approach recognises that to be vulnerable is often to be unable to assert and secure a standard of existence we think appropriate for all humans to enjoy. And whilst human rights may be regarded as having a variety of roles or purposes, nevertheless, the care and protection function, what I refer to as the task of moral rescue, is somehow crucial to the concept. Any notion of human rights that failed to offer protection to those in danger or to those at risk of harm or neglect or abuse, no matter what other benefits it promised or conferred, would be seen as both morally negligent and intellectually impoverished. Yet in this thesis I assert that human rights have largely failed those who are vulnerable and in particular they have often failed those who are especially vulnerable. This failure of human rights is predicated upon three factors. First, human rights are based upon a view of the individual as a rational, autonomous, independent moral agent who at all times identifies and asserts her own best interests. In this thesis I suggest that such a view is misleading. In particular it fails to acknowledge that what often defines the vulnerable, and particularly those who are especially vulnerable, is their inability to act from a rationally, reflective agency. Second, human rights fail to address the different sorts of social and political contexts within which vulnerable people often find themselves. The world of the vulnerable is frequently one of disempowerment, dependency and marginalisation, and this is particularly so with regard to those vulnerable I have identified within the course of this thesis; the frail aged within this country&#65533;s residential aged care facilities, many of whom suffer from dementia, and the chronically mentally ill. Finally, within human rights the emphasis has typically been upon the rights the vulnerable possess and has neglected the duties and obligations that relevant agents owe the vulnerable. In this thesis I assert that the only way to engage the human rights of the vulnerable, in fact the only way to operationalise human rights, is by a strong commitment to duty. In a society so consistently defined by rights, notions of duty all too often appear to be sidelined, yet it is only by an emphasis upon the duties and obligations of caregivers, whoever we take such caregivers to be (doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, policy makers and bureaucrats), that human rights can be engaged and vulnerable people protected. Thus I argue for a notion of the duties and obligations of caregivers as a mean of enacting the human rights that all persons are said to possess. My emphasis in this work is upon those whose vulnerability is extreme. This does not diminish its importance. Increasingly in the West, with the advancing incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as the dementias, we are forced to confront extreme vulnerability. How we engage such persons is crucial to the sorts of lives they lead and is crucial also to the sorts of people we become. We all begin life in an extreme state of vulnerability and there are many times throughout the course of our existence when we may be severely compromised, if only for brief periods. For those of us who suffer from dementia or chronic mental illness, our vulnerability will be persistent and permanent. Thus this perspective recognises that the vulnerable are not a group of people set apart from the rest of us. In many ways it is we who are the vulnerable.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mobility of large anions in crystals with the fluorite structure</field><field name="creator">Lavers, Philip S</field><field name="description">The thesis reports several questions that arise in connection with the thermally induced phenomenon called superionic conduction in the case of halides and oxides with the fluorite structure, principally (i) how can such large anions in a tightly packed configuration move amongst their neighbours with no apparent disruption? and (ii) how can the experimentally observed crowdion structures that involve more than 25% reduction in separation of anions be stable? A third question is posed by the experimentally observed specific heat anomaly that always accompanies the increase in anionic mobility with increasing temperature. The literature review found no answers to these questions, and the thesis records two lines of theoretical research that were followed by the author. Both lines sough mechanisms that would break degeneracy and thus allow the observed mobility and clustering. In part 1 the breathing shell concept (Schroder, 1966) is examined. A model was devised to emulate breathing by spatially perturbing the potential constraint used by Watson (1958) to calculate the in-crystal wave function for the O &#65533; - (which has not been observed as a free ion). The energetics calculated from this model are compatible with the thermal effects being studied and a scenario is expanded qualitatively to suggest the role of various types of solitions. The author concludes that solitions are largely responsible for the degeneracy breaking and the specific head anomaly. However nothing in Part 1 explains the low temperature stability of the fluorite structure where large anions are clustered. In part 2 a quantum mechanical examination of the cohesive energy of the fluorite structure is undertaken in the specific case of doped Zirconium Dioxide for which there was conveniently available basic data. Watsons wave functions were fed into simple density functionals following the method of Gordon and Kim (1972). This was a seminal and successful application of the so called local density approximation (to a uniform electron gas for the purposes of calculating kinetic and exchange-correlation energies). An improvement is proposed-partitioning the electron population according to orbitals and calculating separate kinetic energies. Using this improvement a double potential well in the cohesive energy is discovered that would explain the clustering of anions in the fluorite structure at low temperatures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Yao, Yueping</field><field name="description">A systematic investigation of carbon based anode materials has been made in this Master&#8217;s thesis project. The physical, structural and electrochemical properties of these anode materials have been characterized by a variety of techniques. A literature review summarizes the principles of lithium-ion battery operation, cathode materials, anode materials and electrolytes. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, using nanocrystalline iron powders as the catalyst. The diameter of the as-prepared MWNTs is about 20-50nm. Electrochemical testing shows that the MWNT electrodes had a reversible lithium storage capacity of 340-350mAh/g. The kinetics of Li-ion insertion in carbon nanotube electrodes were characterized by a.c. impedance measurements. The electrochemical properties of graphitized mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode materials were studied. SEM observation shows that MCMB agglomerates have a spherical shape with an average particle size of 13?m. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated a pair of redox peaks, corresponding to lithium insertion and extraction in the MCMB structure. MCMB anodes delivered a reversible capacity of ~325mAh/g with good cyclability. In order to improve the capacity of bare graphite, Sn-coated graphite composites were prepared by using electroless deposition. Cyclic voltammograms show additional redox reaction peaks, which are related to the reaction of Sn with lithium. Sn-graphite composites demonstrated a much higher lithium storage capacity than the bare graphite electrode. Since MCMB anode materials are very stable for lithium-ion insertion and extraction, Sn-coated MCMB composites were developed by combining the high lithium storage, elemental Sn and MCMB to obtain stable cyclability. The Sn-MCMB electrodes show improved capacity and good cyclability within a 15wt% loading of Sn.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/25</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speckle metrology techniques and applications</field><field name="creator">Wang, Kaifu</field><field name="description">Mask-rotating speckle metrology for investigating low-speed dynamic problems has been discussed in detail in this thesis. All the dynamic information for the duration of exposure can be recorded onto one photographic plate and can be continuously reconstructed by the whole-field filtering. The dynamic thermal, flexural and residual deformations, as well as the dynamic out-of-plane displacements, of continuously deformed objects have been successfully measured by using the method proposed in this thesis. The proposed method has also been successfully used for measuring the dynamic slopes of a continuously deformed object. The influence of displacements on slope fringe formation in speckle aperture-shearing metrology has been systematically discussed in this thesis. It has been shown that the in-plane displacement, aperture orientation and shearing direction have a significant influence on slope fringe formation in photographic speckle aperture-shearing metrology. It has also been shown that the in-plane displacement and object-to-wedge distance have an important influence on slope fringe formation in digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology and that the influence is increased with an increase of the in-plane displacement and with a decrease of the object-to-wedge distance. Speckle aperture-shearing metrology, including digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology, for obtaining pure curvature and twist fringes has been studied in this thesis. The slope fringes influencing the contrast of curvature and twist fringes can be completely removed from the patterns of curvature and twist fringes and thus the patterns of pure curvature and twist fringes with high contrast can be obtained. The influence of displacements and strains on pure curvature and twist fringes in speckle aperture-shearing metrology has also been discussed. It has been shown that the in-plane displacements have no direct influence on fringe formation and that the in-plane strains have an important influence on fringe formation. Partially coherent speckle metrology, as well as the factors influencing the quality of speckle fringes, is investigated. It has been successfully used for measurement of slopes. In this thesis, the phase-shifting technique has also been successfully combined with conventional digital speckle aperture-shearing metrology to quantitatively evaluate slopes and strains and applied in digital speckle metrology to determine residual deformations. Volume grating digital speckle metrology has been proposed for measuring the out-of-plane displacement in this thesis. It can be employed to quantitatively evaluate the out-of-plane displacement of deformed objects when combined with the carrier and phase-shifting techniques. It can also be employed for measuring the amplitude distribution of vibrating objects, in which a Bessel fringe pattern with unit contrast can be obtained.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Upland swamps (dells) on the Woronora Plateau, N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Young, Ann Rua Mackenzie</field><field name="description">The surface of the Woronora Plateau, in the southern Sydney Basin, coincides with the top of the Triassic quartzose Hawkesbury Sandstone.  It is etched by broad, shallow valleys which are the headwaters of deep gorges. These upland valleys are sediment-choked, swampy and treeless.  They resemble the 'dellen' (dells) described by early German geomorphologists, and the 'dambos' of southern Africa. On the Woronora Plateau dells occur at 450-550 m elevation, in an area with 1300-1600 mm annual average rainfall, mean annual temperature of 17 degrees C and an annual average excess of rainfall over evaporation of about 850 mm. They occupy between 2% and 9% of the catchments of streams dissecting the plateau, being most extensive and most numerous where the Hawkesbury Sandstone is least deeply dissected. Erosion of the plateau supplies a sandy detritus to the dells.  Because the streams in the dells have small catchment areas and gentle gradients, they do not flush all the sand into the lower valleys and gorges;  thus, sediment accumulates. Sediment washed into the dells is differentiated during overland transport. On the sideslopes, the sediments are characteristically coarse-medium sands with low organic content.  In the valley axes, the organic content rises very abruptly (to more than 10% organic carbon) and the sediments are fine-grained. The waters of the dells are acidic and are low in dissolved oxygen, organic carbon and silica. The vegetation is dominantly sedgeland with some heath. It is differentiated in patterns which reflect sedimentary and hydrological variations within the dells.  Some of the dells display linear patterned ground which resembles that found in fens in the Boreal zone.  The patterns are reinforced by biotic factors (particularly vegetational differentiation and crayfish activities) but appear to be initiated by slow, near-surface flow of saturated sediment. Basal dates of sediments in the dells span at least 17,000 years.  As they are not clustered, sedimentation in the upland valleys has not been triggered by any single, regionally-effective environmental change.  Indeed the old sediments closely resemble t.hose which are presently accumulating, which indicates that environmental change since the late PleIstocene has not been dramatic. It is suggested that the sediments now infillinq the dells are the most recent accumulations in vaIleys which are episodically flushed when intrinsic geomorphic thresholds are reached. Fires followed by severe storms probably trigger these erosional events.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ephemera : Aboriginality, reconciliation, urban perspectives ; Artistic practice in contemporary Aboriginal theatre</field><field name="creator">Syron, Liza-Mare</field><field name="description">At the forefront of cultural, social and political change Contemporary Aboriginal Theatre appeared on the horizon of Australian Theatre in 1968, just one year after the Australian government awarded citizenship rights for Aboriginal Australians.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now central to learning in many contexts and no longer can specialist designers meet the high demand to design the vast number of technology-centred learning events in Higher Education and Human Resource Development. Most teachers and trainers are not equipped to undertake the selection of learning technologies but there is a growing expectation that they do so in the design of technology-centred learning events. In order to enhance the experience of learners or to gain efficiencies, a number of disciplines have engaged in attempts to match technologies to learning events, in particular Management, Education and Instructional Design. Theorists from each of these disciplines have proposed different models and frameworks for understanding the technologies used in the learning process, and the way in which technologies for the learning process are selected. This thesis evaluates these models, explains their deficiencies and puts forward new theoretical frameworks for the activities of the learning process, learning technologies and a method for technology selection. The new theoretical frameworks are called the Learning Activities Model (LAM) and the Leaning Technologies Model (LTM). The Learning Activities Model is based on the argument that the activities of the process of learning can be categorised as provided materials and interactions. The model further divides interactions into four subcategories: - interaction with materials, - interaction between learners, - interaction with the facilitator of learning (or teacher), and - Intra-action, a new term coined by the author to describe learning activities not included in the other categories such as reflection, refinement of opinion etc. The literature of the disciplines of Instructional Design, Human Resource Development, Flexible, Open and Distance Education is surveyed to support this argument. The basis of the Learning Technologies Model is provided in part by researchers in the field of Distance Education through their description of learning technologies as one-way or two-way. However, the research reported in this thesis takes this rather basic conceptual approach, redefines it and juxtaposes it with theoretical analyses developed for media selection in Organisational Communications to produce a new theoretical framework within which learning technologies may be analysed and categorised in the two dimensions of: - one-way or two-way, and - levels of communicative attributes, such as textual, aural and/or visual. This theoretical framework is then expanded by the inclusion of two further criteria. These are the suitability of each technology to categories of the Learning Activities Model and their ability to support synchronous or asynchronous interactions. The Technology Selection Method uses the above theoretical frameworks to match learning technologies to categories of learning activities and, through a four-step process, provides a practical method of technology selection that is simple enough to be used by trainers and teachers who are not Instructional Design specialists and yet robust enough to be used in many subject areas in both the Higher Education and Human Resource Development contexts. The theoretical frameworks have individual uses that are beneficial to trainers, teachers and learning designers as they provide frameworks within which learning activities and learning technologies can be analysed. As well, when they are brought together into The Technology Selection Method they form a method that enables the design of learning events that use learning technologies in a manner that is appropriate to the material, the learners, the context and the budget.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Welding fume plume dispersion</field><field name="creator">Slater, Geoffrey Reginald</field><field name="description">The main concern with welding processes has in the past, generally, concentrated on productivity and quality. However, the occupational health of the welder has become a major focal area in the last decade, and the working environment of the welder is becoming a more important area of investigation. One particular area of interest is the amount of fume present in the operator&#8217;s breathing zone. With the potentially hazardous material present in the breathing environment of the welder, an effective method of controlling this airborne contaminant must be adopted to limit exposure levels to within occupational health and safety limits and to ensure the well being of the worker. This investigation examines the distribution of fume and breathing zone concentration within a controlled space using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The controlled working environment provided the basis for quantifying breathing zone exposure concentrations, and the ability to predict operator exposure.The initial evaluation focused on determining the breathing zone concentration and the welding fume plume dispersal within a confined enclosure. Within a sealed environment GMA welding was performed for approximate 100% duty cycle with two types (copper and non-copper coated) of ER-70S filler wire. The breathing zone and background enclosure concentrations were measured. The purpose of this initial investigation was to evaluate the breathing zone concentration within a confined environment, and to determine a fundamental concentration for direct evaluation of control procedures. The inclusion of the non-copper (low-fuming) coated electrode was to validate the measurements obtained during the study. The low-fuming electrode provided the expected reduction in exposure concentrations in comparison with the copper coated wire, however the concentrations measured over a 15 minute welding cycle were substantial higher than Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) exposure limits.To aid the evaluation of fume control effectiveness, various ventilation strategies were incorporated into the controlled environment. Utilising various modes of general and local extraction enabled an evaluation of the measured breathing zone concentration to be compared with the non-ventilated situation, as well as indicating their relationship with the occupational exposure limits for welding fume. This enabled the breathing zone exposure concentration to be effectively reduced to meet the OHS exposure limits. Although all techniques significantly reduced the exposure concentration, in direct comparison with the confined  &#8216;fundamental&#8217; concentrations, only an appropriately installed local extraction technique provided the required reduction.As well as the breathing zone evaluation, a model to predict the initial dispersion of GMAW fume was developed, aiding in better determining welding fume plume flow behaviour characteristics. This analysis, in addition with classical plume theories, enabled a model of the fume plume characteristics to be developed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of isoflavonoid-derived anti-prostatic cancer agents</field><field name="creator">Faragalla, Jane Eliza</field><field name="description">Phenoxodiol is an isoflavonoid based drug presently in clinical trials in Australia and America for use in prostate cancer. It has been shown to work through various mechanisms of action, including 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition. The aims of this study were to develop new analogues related to phenoxodiol in order to increase 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition and to introduce &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism in the next generation of isoflavonoid derivatives. The &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonistic activity was expected to ameliorate the symptoms associated with prostate enlargement. Work towards the design of synthetic target molecules was the focus of the initial stages of the study. Pharmacophores for each of the human 5-&#945;-reductase type I and type II and the rat type II isozymes were generated using CATALYST&#174;. Standard parameters were used and variable weight options were trialled during the generation process. The mapping of phenoxodiol on the human-based 5-&#945;-reductase phamacophores predicted that an additional aromatic ring should increase 5-&#945;-reductase inhibition. Pharmacophores for &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism, which were previously generated by Bremner et al, were utilized for the mapping of phenoxodiol. It was concluded that a basic nitrogen moiety was required for the introduction of &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism. In the light of these findings, isoflavonoids derivatised at the 2- and 4- positions were designed and assessed on the pharmacophores. Isoflavene derivatives 70 and 67, which incorporated a basic nitrogen at the 2- and 4- positions respectively, were predicted to have &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism. The synthetic targets which incorporated an additional aromatic group entailed the 5-methyl thienylisoflavene 71, the phenyl hydrazone 76 and the 2-thiazolyl isoflavene 77. In an attempt to integrate an increase of 5AR inhibition and &#945;1A adrenoceptor antagonism, the target compound 78 was designed which encompasses both an extra aromatic moiety and a basic nitrogen. A new approach to 2-substituted isoflavene derivatives was developed based on nucleophilic attack on an isoflavylium salt. The isoflavylium salt intermediate was generated from a preformed isoflavene by hydride abstraction using a trityl salt. Eight derivatives were synthesized using this method. Eight 4-aryl hydrazone derivatives were synthesized by reacting an isoflavone with the appropriate aryl hydrazine. A number of other 4 substituted isoflavene derivatives were synthesised either by nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of an isoflavone or by electrophilic addition to the enol tautomer of an isoflavone. A new rearrangement of a C-4 thienyl substituted isoflavanol to a benzo[b]furan system was discovered. Another new rearrangement involving the transformation of the imidazolylhydrazone 162 to the benzo[b]furan derivative 163 was also found. While nitrile precursors of targets incorporating basic amine groups were obtained, reduction to the amines was not successfully achieved. A human 5AR type I assay was developed sourcing LnCap cells for the enzyme. Unfortunately, LnCap cell line contamination occurred resulting in corruption of the assay. Compounds synthesised in this study were also tested for biological activity against a variety of cancer cell lines and a number of compounds with potent anti-cancer properties were identified. In particular the p-nitrophenylhydrazone 159d showed excellent growth inhibitory activity against the androgen dependent prostate cancer cell line and is a potential lead compound for further development. This result indicates that the 5AR pharmacophores generated are predictive.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A weighting scheme for content-based image retrieval</field><field name="creator">Zhong, Yuan</field><field name="description">In a query-by-example(QBE) image retrieval, the user is required to provide a single query image that most represents the features of the target images. On the other hand, 'query by multiple images' paradigm assumes that the user is able to describe the target images more accurately by using multiple query images rather than one. Low level features, such as color, texture or edge information, are used to represent the images. These features are combined and expected to match the human perception properly. A set of psychological experiments are designed and conducted in this thesis with the aim of gaining insight into how a user perceives similar images. The retrieval results obtained by human subjects are compared with those obtained by using MPEG-7 visual descriptors. It is found that proper weight assignment in combining different features for retrieval can improve the retrieval performance. A novel weighting scheme for Query-by-Multiple-Images (QBMI) retrieval systems which aims to match human perception is proposed. The weights are derived by a new method of ascribing relative importance to feature descriptors for given a query set. Experimental results have shown that our weighing method is more effective than both equal weights and heuristic weighting method.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of hot rolling events that lead to ridge-buckle defect in steel strips</field><field name="creator">Melfo, Wanda Maria Carolina</field><field name="description">Thinly cold-rolled steel sheet, following hot-rolling, sporadically present a defect known in industry as ridge-buckle. The defect is only detected in the last stage of production of thin rolled strips, after they have been hot rolled, cold rolled, annealed and tempered. Ridge-buckle consists of sinusoidal waveforms located in one or two bands near the central region of the strip width and in most cases, affecting the full length of the strip. Coils with such a defect have to be discarded or degraded. The aim of this manuscript is to present our contribution towards an elucidation of the origins of ridge-buckle defect by experimental and theoretical approaches combined with analysis of plant data.We explored two of the main factors that in the past, has been regarded as possible origins of ridge-buckle defect: a) the occurrence of microstructural variations along the width of the hot rolled strip, which could lead to different extents of deformation during cold rolling and subsequent operations; and b) the presence of a protuberance (also called ridge) on the hot rolled strip, which will directly affect the shape of the cold rolled strip.The possibility that variations in grain size or crystallographic texture along the width of the strip could contribute to the formation of ridge-buckle defect was explored by studying samples extracted from strips hot-rolled in the industrial process. We determined experimentally and compared quantitatively, the ferrite grain sizes and the crystallographic orientations of grains along the width of the strip. In the strips studied, no evidence was found of any statistically significant variations in these two microstructural variables.Empirical models of recrystallization were used in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the quantitative impact of minor temperature variations (of the order experienced in practice) on the strip strength and hence, its mechanical behaviour within the rolling process. This exploratory exercise confirmed that the strip strength during hot rolling varies very little as a result of relatively small variations in temperature along the width of the strip. Furthermore, the ferrite grain size developed following hot-rolling and cooling on the run-out table, also varies very little due to the temperature variations measured. Therefore, the strength of the hot rolled strip along its width is not affected to the extent that can have a significant influence on the deformation in the subsequent rolling processes. These calculations led us to conclude that ridge in the hot rolled strip is not related to uneven deformation during rolling due to strength variations and hence, ridge buckle defect cannot be attributed to strength differences along the width of the hot-rolled strip.In industrial practice, the occurrence of ridge-buckle in subsequent cold rolling operations has been linked to the presence of ridges in the hot rolled strip. Moreover, a modelling study conducted in parallel with this investigation confirmed this link. Having established that variations in microstructure, texture or strength along the hot-rolled strip width are unlikely causes of the occurrence of ridgebuckle defect we attempted to link ridge occurrence in hot rolled strips and to uneven roll-wear in the finishing mill. By collecting data of 40 consecutive schedules, we were able to determine that ridge formation in hot rolled strips is a common occurrence. Moreover, uneven roll-wear was frequently observed, at least in the period and in the schedules over which our data were collected. A significant finding was the establishment of a strong link between ridge occurrence on the hotrolled strips and uneven roll wear occurring close to the centre of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill.The evidence of uneven wear on the work-rolls in the hot strip mill led our study to an assessment of the possible causes of uneven roll-wear. A thorough review of the available literature in conjunction with the evidence we found of excessive ridge formation in steels containing silicon, led to the hypothesis that the integrity of the tertiary strip scale in the roll bite could be a major contributing factor to uneven roll-wear.We developed a method to study in-situ the formation of oxides on the hot steel substrate, by adapting a High Temperature Microscope with means to introduce air instantaneously onto the surface of the sample. This technique enabled us to study oxidation of the steel surface under conditions closely simulating the oxygen potential pertaining to the rolling temperatures in industrial finishing rolling practice (excluding the complicating effects of water cooling). The in-situ experimentation was complemented with a thorough characterisation of the oxides remaining on the samples after cooling by using relevant metallographic techniques.The experiments were conducted on two types of steel, low carbon steel and silicon containing steel. The results show distinctive differences in the oxidation behaviour of the two types of steel. The low carbon steel form a typical three-layered structure of iron oxides although with very little (almost undetectable) hematite formation. On the other hand, the silicon steels, which apart from silicon also contain aluminium and manganese in small amounts, formed a thick interface layer of complex oxides and intermetallics between the substrate and a layer of magnetite followed by a hematite layer at the gas/oxide interface. It was evident that in silicon steels, the formation of the interface layer interfered with the diffusion of iron species as the final oxide layer was significantly thinner than the oxide layer that formed on low-carbon steel.Another significant finding in the case of low carbon steel was the tendency of the oxide to detach or &#8220;spall&#8221; from the surface during oxide growth. We were able to observe the detachment of the oxide in-situ with precise account of the time and temperature of occurrence. The relevance of this finding is that if sufficient time elapsed between spallation of the scale and the strip entering the roll-bite, brittle scale would form (due to isolation of the oxide layer from the iron source). The scale then will fracture under the loads applied in the roll-bite, affecting the heat transfer to the rolls and hence, its thermal fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we were able to observe and determine the time to nucleation of new oxides that form on top of already existing oxides on low carbon steel substrate. The time required to nucleate the new oxide is related to the austenite grain size of the steel substrate. Further studies are proposed to elucidate the exact nature of this interesting sequence of events.Finally, early oxidation events were linked to uneven roll-wear due to fracture of the scale in the roll-bite, an increase in the heat transfer rate to the work-roll surface and friction in the roll-bite. An assessment of the possible causes that may affect the integrity of the tertiary scale led us to conclude that whenever uneven changes occur in the cooling patterns of the strip or roll, in descaling efficiency or in the lubrication systems, uneven roll-wear could result.Although a definitive solution to the 40-year old problem of ridge-buckle defect is still to be found, we have made advances in narrowing the possible origins of the defect to specific causes or events. Ridge-buckle is originated mainly by the presence of ridge in the hot-rolled strip; in turn, ridge occurrence is related to uneven wear of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill. Uneven wear is most likely caused by failure of the tertiary scale, due most probably to uneven cooling and/or lubrication patterns during the hot rolling process. In addition to these findings, a novel method of studying scale formation during the early stages of the interaction between oxygen and the steel substrate was developed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the effect of preparation on response execution and inhibition in the go/nogo task</field><field name="creator">Smith, Janette L</field><field name="description">In five studies, this thesis examined inhibitory processing in the Go/NoGo task, during which participants were instructed to either execute or withhold a prepared response. These studies extended previous Go/NoGo research by investigating the relationship between prior response preparation and subsequent inhibitory processing, with the aim of clarifying the relationship between the N2 and P3 ERP components and inhibitory processing. This was achieved by (1) the use of a fixed foreperiod prior to the Go/NoGo stimulus, (2) the concurrent examination of other components related to stimulus perception (e.g., N1, P2, early CNV) and action (e.g., the late slow wave), (3) the use of both overt and covert responses, and (4) the use of informative cues to elicit differential preparation for a Go or NoGo stimulus. The main results were that a NoGo N2 effect can be robustly observed using auditory stimuli, but that the N2 does not appear to reflect motor or cognitive/pre-motor inhibition, or the detection of conflict between responses. The NoGo P3, however, behaved in a fashion consistent with an inhibitory interpretation, being increased following higher levels of preparation for a response, absent when no inhibition was required to NoGo stimuli, and increased over the brain region specifically involved in motor commands. The results cast doubt on the current inhibitory and conflict interpretations of the N2, and suggest rather that the P3 may represent an inhibitory process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the usability of online grocery systems to improve customer satisfaction and uptake</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Mark Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the usability of Online Grocery Systems (OGSs) in order to improve both customer satisfaction and uptake. This assessment was conducted in three phases using two different types of Usability Evaluation Methods (UEMs). Phase 1 was conducted using an expert review of 14 OGSs through heuristic evaluations and checklist/framework evaluations. Phase 2 was conducted using usability testing at one OGS that was deemed to be (based on the expert review in Phase 1) an OGS with good usability. The expert review was conducted by 54 participants with varying levels of online shopping experience. The results from the expert review (Phase 1) showed that the usability of the major Australian OGSs was comparable with those from other countries. The results from the usability testing (Phase 2) revealed usability issues with the OGS identified as having good usability, shown through the errors made by participants.The recording of errors in regards to the usability of systems has traditionally focused on safety-critical systems and business support systems. This study applies Zapf et al.&#8217;s &#8216;Taxonomy of Errors&#8217; to a non-work related context: the OGS. The taxonomy was found to show that similar types of errors were made by all users of such systems. However, the number of errors that were recorded by different user groups varied. This finding was in contrast to previous studies, and supported the common perception that beginner users make a greater number of errors than more experienced users.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new defence of poetry : and new possibilities from hypertext to ecopoetry</field><field name="creator">Bennett, John</field><field name="description">This thesis is, in part, a response to the loss of poetry as an epistemic discourse, a process that began with the development of writing. However, it is also energised by new opportunities of using the powerful tool of language, and techniques of poetry.The thesis aims to update previous defences of poetry, rebutting Plato&#8217;s initial attack in Ion, claiming poetry is non-cognitive. While building on a famous tradition, this thesis expands the repertoire of argumentation,  ncorporating findings from the cognitive sciences, and insights from pragmatist, phenomenological, and ecological perspectives on the emergent/embodied nature of cognition. An emphasis on a speech-based poetics and embodied skilled practice, with no claims to transcend the ordinary and everyday, undermines formalist approaches. This approach is developed through an investigation of two new forms of the poem &#8211; ecopoetry and hypertext poetry; fresh forms to reinvigorate, not only poetry discourse, but ways of dwelling in the world.Throughout this thesis, the processes by which language comes to mean, and be used, are explored, with a view to explaining the power of poetry. Poems provide cognitive opportunities for making use of the amazing cognitive techniques that we have co-evolved with; techniques, which put us in touch with our environments. This thesis is subject to adventure, and its arc of 16 short chapters closes with poems in Part 3.The thesis is presented in three parts:Part 1. Background Poetics - Poet as Language AnimalThis part explores a naturalistic and empirical account of the language animal, revealing how language is a powerful cognitive technique, used both internally and externally. Identified are:&#8226; Research findings from the cognitive sciences, which support emergent and interactionist models of the mind-brain-body, and suggest humans are embodied ecological beings;  &#8226; the key concepts of cognitive fluidity (mapping across domains); extelligence (externalising memory workloads); and scaffolding (extending the mind into the material world), all of which maximise cognitive abilities. Nature, mind-body, culture, tools and techne (embodied skill) are intertwined, processural and emergent; and &#8226; the fundamental poetic character of language (metaphoric, affective, musical etc.), which empowers and energises cognitive abilities. Poetry is a key tool of the multi-faceted techniques, which we name language. Poems are complex cognitive tools, which expand our ability to understand, and move through the world.Part 2. The Nature and Possibilities of PoemsPart 2 explores the nature and possibilities of poems, and:&#8226; proposes an explanatory tripartite model of the poem (Speech-Act; Practice/Discourse; Art(e)fact), and develops the notion that poems are cognitive scaffolds; &#8226; argues that ecopoetry is not simply a sophisticated development of nature/landscape genres, but requires a revolution in understanding the world, and how it works (including, importantly, homo sapiens). Attentiveness to environments and ecological cycles, and a prescriptive perspective to human interrelations, requires poems to be porous to the world, including other discourses, and varieties of experience. This, in turn, requires innovative and open forms. &#8226; critiques current trends in digital generative poetries, which frequently re-engage 20th C avant-garde techniques. The danger is that techne (embodied skill) is being replaced by technology. The possibility of using hypertext as an informational technique (as originally imagined) also points to innovative open forms.Part 3.

The model enables the identification of ways in which reform policies have transmitted their effects to the domestic economy, as well as enabling an exploration of the impact of external shocks on the Vietnamese economy and the policy implications that flow from them. The macroeconomic adjustment policies emphasised in this thesis consist of trade liberalisation, state-owned enterprise privatisation, and expansionary fiscal policy. The findings obtained from this study are important in the context of contemporary Vietnam, in terms of providing the basis for evaluating alternative policy recommendations. The model developed contains a number of key assumptions. The domestic economy produces output that is consumed domestically and is an imperfect substitute for the imported good equivalent. The price of these goods is domestically determined. The deterministic framework of the model, combined with economic agents possessing rational expectations, is equivalent to the case of perfect foresight. Financial markets are assumed to be in continual equilibrium, while non-financial markets are subject to sticky price and quantity adjustment. The model developed focuses on the long run nature of the dynamic adjustment process, because the reform measures focused upon will exert important long run effects on the Vietnamese economy. This arises from allowing for physical capital stock accumulation and from the requirement that the current account balance must be zero in equilibrium. A number of specific features are incorporated in the model that make it more applicable to the Vietnamese case: (i) explicitly distinguishing the contributions of both SOEs and the private sector to domestic aggregate supply in examining the impact of privatisation policy; (ii) incorporating trade restrictions on either exports and imports in analysing the impact of external liberalisation on the economy; (iii) explicitly distinguishing the composition of government expenditure (current and capital) in analysing the impact of expansionary public investment spending on domestic private investment capital as well as economic development in Vietnam; and (iv) distinguishing macroeconomic outcomes from a fixed exchange rate with imperfect capital mobility system to that from a flexible exchange rate with perfect capital mobility system. Three types of policy reforms are simulated: (1) in carrying out privatisation it is assumed that 5 per cent of the capital stock of SOEs is given to the private sector; (2) the nominal exchange rate is assumed to be devalued by 5 per cent; (3) and the tariff rate is assumed to be reduced by 5 per cent. For each shock, with the assumption that the economy is operating in a fixed exchange rate system, the simulation was carried out at different speeds, gradually and immediately. Two extreme reform packages, in which privatisation, tariff reform, and devaluation are undertaken at the same time, designed to illustrate the more complex cases of gradualism and shock therapy approaches, are also considered. In addition, these shocks are considered in an alternative model, in which a flexible exchange rate with perfect capital mobility is assumed. The impact of changes in government capital expenditure, combined with these reform policies, on the Vietnamese economy, are then explicitly analysed. The simulation results suggest that different reform policies can have different effects upon the Vietnamese economy. The main findings from the simulation results for the single policy (exchange rate devaluation, tariff reduction, and privatisation) indicate that, under the fixed exchange rate and imperfect capital mobility system, for the short run period, the government should adopt the Big Bang approach because this has positive impacts upon Vietnamese economic development. For the medium and long run periods this approach would still be advisable for the case of an exchange rate devaluation, because by adopting this approach the deterioration of the private capital stock, aggregate supply, and international competitiveness could be minimised. However, there is no difference in the impact upon Vietnamese economic development irrespective of whether the application of the tariff reduction and SOE privatisation is up-front or partial. When these three policies are conducted at the same time, the Big Bang approach is still the best approach for the macroeconomic variables except for foreign asset stocks, which can have a benefit only from the reform package if it is done gradually over a specific period of time. For the complete reform policy package, when comparing the alternative versions of the model, under a floating exchange rate and liberalised capital controls, the gradual approach is somewhat better than the Big Bang approach in regard to the increase of domestic production, private investment and international competitiveness over the short and medium run periods. The major conclusion obtained from the comparison between the two versions of the model is that the reform package, when introduced gradually in the flexible exchange rate system with deregulated financial markets, can produce better macroeconomic outcomes for Vietnam. This conclusion is also supported from a simulation involving a temporary increase in public capital spending combined with a reform package.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of small business strategic alliances in the adoption of E-commerce in small-medium enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="creator">Macgregor, Robert Colin</field><field name="description">his thesis describes the examination of the role of small business strategic alliances in the adoption of E-commerce by regional small-medium enterprises (SMEs).

For many lecturers, the increasing emphasis on the use of ICT for research and teaching can be threatening, but these fears can be eased if professional development is supportive and ongoing, and provided in flexible, appropriate and adaptable ways. This study focused on collaboration strategies employed by four lecturers and two instructional designers (IDs) as they worked together to develop online learning environments as well as other types of learning resources. It focuses on two case studies and describes the roles that the two IDs played in facilitating the professional development of lecturers that were constructing e-Learning environments. The findings suggest that the lecturers needed ongoing support, advice and technical assistance for an extended period of time. Lecturers who are novices in using ICT for learning, should be encouraged to attend basic ICT training programs before working with IDs and ICT experts to design e-Learning resources for their subjects. Providing technical training by ICT experts enables lecturers to see the benefits and potential of ICT in learning and gives them the confidence to plan effective e-Learning environments. The results are consistent with previous research findings, stressing the need for professional (IDs, ICT experts and lecturers) to collaborate and share their ideas, knowledge, expertise and skills in order to plan and design effective and meaningful learning environments. It is also important for IDs to explain their role clearly and outline the type of support and assistance they would provide during the design process. Lecturers who collaborated closely with the ID/ICT experts gained more skills and were prepared to use ICT in learning while those who spent less time with them were less confident and had to attend ICT training courses during the session. This study demonstrated that having regular group meetings during the design process, receiving individual ICT support, having a good rapport between members of the design team helped to decrease lecturers' concerns and ICT problems. This study has enabled the researcher to develop a team collaboration model for planning and designing e-Learning resources that would be piloted in tertiary institutions in Papua New Guinea. The findings, also contributes to the research literature about the design processes needed to improve the quality of learning resources. As team members share and learn from each other's experiences and expertise, they create authentic and student centred learning environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cryptographic privacy enhancing technologies</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Lan Duy</field><field name="description">The growth of information and communication technology creates difficulties for individuals to monitor and control their private information which can be copied, transferred from one location to another within a second and accessible to many people. This thesis focuses on a number of cryptographic technologies, which have been introduced and developed to protect user privacy, including anonymous signatures, anonymous authentication, anonymous credentials and anonymous routing. Our contributions to these technologies are in three aspects: more efficiency, more security and better functionality. We identify and formalize new security requirements, and improve and build formal security models for a number of privacy-preserving primitives. We construct new anonymous routing systems whose security relies on complexity assumptions different from those of previous systems. We propose several anonymous signature schemes with constant computation costs, very short signatures and keys and compact system parameters that can be shared by multiple groups. These schemes can be converted into anonymous authentication schemes and used as building blocks for anonymous credential systems.

Both polypyrroles and polyanilines are examined. Following a General Introduction and an Experimental Chapter, the new studies are described in Chapters 3 to 7. In Chapter 3 it is shown that polypyrrole doped with either &#61665;-cyclodextrin sulfate (&#61665;-CDS) or &#61666;-cyclodextrin sulfate (&#61666;-CDS) is readily deposited electrochemically. Electrodeposited polypyrrole has been characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, AFM, SEM, microanalysis, and electrical conductivity measurements.This electrodeposited polypyrrole can easily be prepared as a composite membrane (with Pt-coated PVDF) for use in metal ion transport experiments. Transport of metal ions across PPy.&#61666;-CDS is shown to be significantly greater than across PPy.&#61665;-CDS, and also greater than that previously observed with related polypyrroles. However, the increased flux results in a loss in the selectivity that the membrane shows between different metal ions. Chapter 4 describes a novel electroless polymerisation of pyrrole in the presence of the sulfonated calixarene, calix[6]arene-4-sulfonic acid (C6S). A solution containing pyrrole and C6S undergoes a slow polymerisation reaction in the absence of any added chemical oxidant or electrochemical oxidation. A specific host-guest interaction between pyrrole and C6S is thought to be an important part of the reaction mechanism. The product of this reaction is an insulating black powder. However, it is electroactive and exhibits spectral features similar to conducting polypyrroles and is doped with C6S. On the basis of the obtained data, a structure consisting of small conducting regions of polypyrrole isolated by insulating pyrrolidine and ring-opened products is proposed. The addition of polymeric stabilisers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl pyrrolidinone) or poly(styrene sulfonate) results in the formation of stable colloidal dispersions of the polypyrrole. The interaction of polyaniline and some biological phosphates (particularly adenosine- 5&#8242;-triphosphate (ATP)) is reported in Chapter 5. When ATP is included as a dopant during the electrosynthesis of polyaniline, highly optically active films with chiral anisotropy factors as high as 1.9 % are obtained. It is believed that this optical activity arises from interactions between hydrogen- and ionic-bonding sites of the ATP dopant with the amine nitrogen (NH) and radical cation (+&#8226;NH) centres on the polyaniline chains. These highly optically active polyaniline films retain their optical activity upon de-doping, re-doping, oxidation and reduction. Initial investigations into potential applications for these polyanilines show that the release of ATP from the polymers cannot be electrochemically or pH controlled; and no chiral discrimination towards 10- camphorsulfonic acid is observed. The covalent attachment of a chiral substituent to nitrogen centres of polyaniline is examined in Chapter 6. 10-camphorsulfonyl chloride readily reacts with polyaniline emeraldine base in solution to form a weakly optically active emeraldine salt. This substituted polyaniline retains its optical activity in solution even upon alkaline dedoping. However, optical activity is lost upon oxidation and reduction. An analogous reaction can also be performed on leucoemeraldine base to form a virtually identical optically active emeraldine salt. Alternatively, a similar reaction on aniline monomer forms a substituted chiral monomer. However, this monomer cannot be polymerised, presumably due to the steric and/or electron withdrawing effects of the 10-camphorsulfonyl substituent. In the final chapter, Chapter 7, the induction of chirality into poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) via acid-base interactions with a range of chiral bases is investigated. Films evaporatively cast from aqueous solutions of PMAS mixed with alkaloids, amino acids or adenosine are all found to be optically active, confirming induction of chirality into the PMAS chains. The origin of this chiral induction is discussed on the basis of the chiroptical properties of the PMAS.Chiral Base species obtained.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workflow analysis to identify the opportunities for improving information management and nurses' work efficiency in palliative care</field><field name="creator">Ma, Shaohui</field><field name="description">As a means to identify the appropriate opportunities for an organisation to apply Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to streamline its process, workflow analysis is the essential first step in achieving better process management and efficiency. The purpose of this research is to understand, through workflow analysis, the step-by-step process of tasks completed by nurses in a palliative care ward and a community healthcare centre. This understanding will contribute to the accurate identification of appropriate opportunities for applications of ICT that fit the nurses' relevant task requirements, and will improve work efficiency of the nurses involved in palliative care. The literature review gives the general concepts of the research and background information about both palliative care and optional applications of ICT. The materials are gathered via the Internet and library. This research is conducted in the palliative care ward at Port Kembla Hospital and the community healthcare centre of the Illawarra region. The major data collecting methods are interview and observation conducted in the ward and the community healthcare centre. These data collecting methods have advantages and characteristics of qualitative research methodology that benefited this research project. The direct outcome of this research is a set of workflow analysis diagrams covering the major procedures of the nurses' daily practice. Through analysing these workflow diagrams, this thesis describes the situations for the potential applications of ICT, the use of the applications, and the benefits of implementing these applications. After the description and discussion in this thesis, the chosen ICT applications are Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), wireless technology, scanner and barcode systems, as well as an advanced database system. The adoption of these applications has the potential to improve the management of medical information, and the work efficiency and effectiveness of the nurses' daily practice, and benefit the palliative care patients and their families.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toughening polymer surfaces</field><field name="creator">Ali, Haider K</field><field name="description">The thermoset resin poly diglycol carbonate, commercially called CR-39 has excellent optical properties, is cheaper than other ophthalmic materials and is considered one of the best plastic materials for the industry. CR 39 is known to be a brittle, highly cross-linked polymer. Applying coating layers significantly affects the toughness of ophthalmic lenses; a crack will first start on the surface of the coating and propagate through to the lens. One procedure to stop cracking, although not favoured by the industry because of its cost and detrimental effect on the optical properties, is to place a thin, rubbery layer between the coating and CR-39 ophthalmic lens.An alternative method to stop the cracking is to toughen the lens material itself by placing the upper and lower surfaces under compressive stress. Swelling the lens surface can generate compressive stress and generating a multi-composite stressed layer lens can significantly improve fracture toughness.An axisymmetric model of the spherical lens was built and a static load was applied on the central region in order to analyse stress distribution on the surfaces of the lens. It was found that tensile stress dominates the lower surface when the load was applied on the top surface. A volumetric swelling was introduced into the axisymmetric model to generate compressive stress onto the swollen surface while the tensile stress region on the lower surface was moved towards the central region of the spherical lens. The volumetric swelling transferred the stress in the horizontal axis from the tension to the compression region.More than one system has been designed to evaluate the best swelling agent; chloroform was the best solvent and a mixture of chloroform with acrylic acid (monomer) was found to be the best swelling agent for the CR-39 ophthalmic lens. Ultra Violet (UV) light initiated polymerisation was used to polymerise the monomer within the surface of CR-39 ophthalmic lens. The temperature during this process remained below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of CR-39 polymer.Raman spectroscopy was used to examine the residual vinyl group in CR-39 polymer and monitor the diffusion process of the monomer in the CR-39 lens surface and the polymerisation process of the diffused monomer. The depth of this treatment was measured by using the mapping technique in Raman spectroscopy. The stress generated from swelling the lens surface was measured by photoelasticity. A 3-point bending device was developed and attached to a circular polariscope to measure the optical stress coefficient of CR-39 because it is a transparent material.Fracture energy was evaluated using the static impact and dynamic tests and significant improvements from treating both upper and lower surfaces and applying a hard coating to the treated lenses were observed. Surface characterisation techniques were used to determine the effect of the treatment applied to the CR-39 ophthalmic lenses. Ultra-Micro Indentation System (UMIS) analysis measurements using Berkovich and spherical indenters showed a decrease in the elastic modulus. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) measurements using the penetration and single cantilever modes showed an increase in loss modulus and a decrease in storage modulus accompanied by a lower compression modulus for the treated surfaces. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies revealed that the treated surface of a CR-39 ophthalmic lens was smoother than an untreated surface.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Standardization and Adaptation of Knowledge Processes in International Businesses</field><field name="creator">Ang, Zhiyi</field><field name="description">There is an ongoing debate on whether standardization or adaptation is more appropriate in international business. Knowledge Management is a relatively new discipline compared to other disciplines. In other disciplines such as strategy, marketing and human resource management there are well-developed theories on standardization and adaptation. This means that forces for standardization and adaptation were well developed in these disciplines. In the current literature for knowledge management, most of them had concentrated on factors affecting knowledge management. Most of the current literature appears to ignore the effects of differences in countries. There are arguments on both sides on whether standardization or adaptation is more appropriate for international knowledge management. From the current literature there are four types of outcomes that can occur from international knowledge management which are appropriate standardization, appropriate adaptation, inappropriate standardization and inappropriate adaptation. However there is a lack of research and study on factors affecting the standardization and adaptation of international knowledge management. There is also lack of research on differences between the firms with the four different types of standardization and adaptation outcomes.Much of the arguments about adaptation in international knowledge management had focused on cross-cultural knowledge management, which focused on the effects of national culture on knowledge management. There is also a substantial amount of research on factors affecting knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Thus this research is also interested in finding out how differences in national culture could affect the knowledge creation and the knowledge transfer process. It is also interested in finding out how differences in national culture would affect factors that are important for knowledge creation and knowledge transfer.For methodology this research has chosen to use a case study approach. Although both qualitative and quantitative questions were used in the survey, greater emphasis has been placed on using a qualitative approach. Thirty-one respondents were used in this research and they consist of respondents from various countries. Theoretical sampling was used and only firms with an overseas subsidiary were selected. The responses were gathered by a variety of means which includes interviews from phones, emails, interview in person. Some of the findings for this research include the following:1) Forces for standardization include Global Strategy, centralized organization structure, organization culture and creative chaos, standardized approach towards international business, pressure for cost reduction, risk reduction, Industry of the organization, knowledge management is a new idea, minimal differences in national culture and national culture of headquarters.2) Forces for adaptation include Transnational or Multidomestic strategy, decentralized organization structure, adapted approach towards international business and differences in national culture.3) Differences in national culture have different effects on the knowledge creation process and the knowledge transfer process. Differences in national culture have the greatest effect on the knowledge creation process, Step 1: Sharing Tacit Knowledge. For the knowledge transfer process, differences in national culture had the greatest effect on Step 2: Implementation.4) Some of the differences between the four different outcomes from standardization and adaptation are likely to be caused by differences in national culture and the firm&#8217;s level of adaptation for the knowledge creation and knowledge transfer process.5) Differences in national culture had an effect on factors affecting knowledge creation which are Care, managing conversations and job rotation. Job Rotation and the management of expatriates had an effect on the factors that are important for knowledge transfer. Some of the factors affecting knowledge transfer that are affected by differences in national culture include leadership, human resource management practices, absorptive capacity, source transfer capacity and desirability of Knowledge.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A time series analysis of structural breaks, and export-GDP nexus in Iran</field><field name="creator">Pahlavani, Mosayeb</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the major determinants of GDP growth in Iran using annual time series data spanning the years from 1960 through 2003. The Iranian economy has been subject to a multitude of structural changes and regime shifts during the sample period. Thus after applying conventional unit root tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) procedures, time series properties of the data are analysed by applying the Zivot-Andrews (ZA, 1992) model, Perron's (1997) Innovational Outlier (IO) and Additive Outlier (AO) models and finally the Lumsdaine and Papell (LP, 1997) approach to determine endogenously the more likely time of major structural breaks in various macroeconomic variables of the Iranian economy. Based on the above models, the presence of one and two unknown structural breaks in the data are considered. After accounting for the single most significant structural break, the results from the ZA, IO and AO models clearly indicate that for all series under examination, the null hypothesis of at least one unit root cannot be rejected, a result consistent with those of conventional unit root tests. In other words, the empirical results based on both the conventional unit root tests as well as on all the above new models of unit root tests which take into account the presence of potential structural breaks, indicate that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of unit root for any of the variables under investigation. However, when two structural breaks are incorporated into the testing procedure within the framework proposed by LP, the test results indicate that the unit root hypothesis is indeed rejected for some of the variables under investigation at the 10 per cent level or better. It should be noted that the critical values reported by LP (1997) cannot be used to make a decision about the stationarity of the series under investigation in this research. The empirical literature shows that the critical values are heavily dependent on the sample size and as the sample size in the present study differs markedly from LP's, applying this testing procedure, only the existence of two significant potential structural breaks in the data can be determined and it is not possible to adequately examine the stationarity of the data under investigation. Empirical results indicate that for a majority of the variables under investigation the endogenously determined break dates based on the above mentioned methodologies closely correspond to some important phenomena in the economy such as (a) the oil boom in the 1974-75; (b) the effects of the Islamic Revolution (regime change) in 1979 and finally (c) the outbreaks of the Iraqi war in the1980s. In order to address the role of exports in economic growth, i.e. to examine the export-led growth hypothesis (ELG) in an oil based economy, an extended Feder-type aggregate production function model is proposed, which considers the broad range of externality effects of exports (both oil and non-oil) on the economy. In this model, by following the endogenous growth theory as well as recent empirical findings on the trade-GDP nexus, factors such as: physical capital (R&amp;D effects), human capital (representing knowledge spillover effects), export expansion (proxying positive externality effects), and total imports (capturing learning-by-doing effects) are considered in order to determine their effects on economic growth. A production function approach which includes all of the above-mentioned factors is then used in the cointegration analyses: both conventional cointegration approaches such as the Johansen-Juselius (1990) technique as well as newer cointegration approaches (e.g. Gregory-Hansen (1996) and Saikkonen and Lutkepohl (2000)) are employed to determine the long-run drivers of economic growth in the presence of structural breaks in Iran. This latter cointegration technique accommodates potential structural breaks which could potentially undermine the existence of a long-run relationship between GDP growth and its main determinants. As both traditional cointegration tests (like Johansen-Juselius), as well as tests for cointegration in the presence of structural breaks (i.e., GH (1996) and SL (2000)) have all shown that there exists only one cointegrating vector, therefore applying the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure is the best way of determining long- run and short-run relationships. The ARDL procedure is more appropriate with mixed order I (0) and I (1) processes. For this reason, the error correction version of the ARDL procedure is then employed to specify the short- and long-term determinants of economic growth in the presence of structural breaks. The estimated model tracks the historical data very well and satisfies various specification and stability tests. Empirical estimates indicate that, in the long-term, policies aimed at promoting various types of physical investment, human capital, trade openness and technological innovations will improve economic growth. More specifically, empirical results show that while the effects of gross capital formation and oil exports are highly significant and important, as expected, for the expansion of the Iranian GDP over the sample period, non-oil exports and human capital are generally less pivotal and have an even smaller effect than had been anticipated. However, whilst the long run non-oil exports are small, they are statistically significant. It is also found that the speed of adjustment in the estimated models is relatively high with 40-60 percent of disequilibrium eliminated within one year. The empirical findings of this research indicate that in order to achieve high and stable economic growth and to protect the economy from the negative effects of oil price fluctuations, the Iranian government should continue its quest for more efficient and effective non-oil export promotion policies as well as its diversification strategies aimed at weaning the economy from its dependence on the oil sector.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards silicon microdosimetry based verification of Monte Carlo calculations in Hadron therapy</field><field name="creator">Cornelius, Iwan M</field><field name="description">This thesis continues research into the application of silicon microdosimetry to hadron therapy applications. It proposes the use of silicon microdosimetry for the verification of Monte Carlo calculations in hadron therapy. When applied in this manner, many of the restrictions previously impeding the use of silicon microdosimeters in hadron therapy are relaxed. An ion mircrophone was used to study the charge collection properties of the silicon microdosimeters using ions commonly found in the primary and secondary radiation of hadron therapy. An experimental setup was developed and diagnostic studies were conducted to establish low beam fluence and micron beam resolution necessary for the measurements. GEANT4 Monte Carol simulations of the measurements facilitated the quantification of the charge collection efficiency of the devices for ions with various Linear Energy Transfer values. An ion beam analysis technique was developed to measure the collection time of charge carriers generated following ion strikes on the silicon microdosimeter. The dependence of this charge collection time was studied using the ion microprobe. A pulse shape discrimination technique was then implemented in an attempt to improve the spectral response of the microdosimeter. Simple Monte Carol simulations of silicon microdosimetry measurements in Fast Neutron Therapy and Proton Therapy were conducted using the GEANT4 Monte Carlo toolkit. The charge collection efficiency information obtained from microprobe experiments was incorporated into the simulation. Discrpancies between experimental and theoretical measurements was then used to suggest improvements to the simulations. Future recommendations for the application of silicon microdosimeters in this capacity are discussed along with suggestions for other silicon based instrumentation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heavy minerals in marine and fluvial sediments: provenance indicators and distributions in the tropical southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its hinterland North Australia</field><field name="creator">Haredy, Rabea A</field><field name="description">Provenance and spatial distribution of heavy minerals have been investigated in the tropical southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its major surrounding river systems, Northern Australia.  Heavy mineral assemblages in the very fine sand fraction (63-125&#956;m) of 365 sediment samples were assessed using petrographic and electron microprobe analyses. In addition to opaque minerals, seventeen translucent heavy mineral types were identified in the study area. Zircon, tourmaline hornblende, epidote, sillimanite, rutile and garnet generally represent about 80-100% of the total translucent heavy mineral assemblage.The chemically variable tourmaline, amphibole, epidote and garnet mineral grains show wide compositional ranges. Tourmaline grains are mostly schorl or dravite, associated with very rare uvite. Amphibole grains mainly consist of calcic-amphibole in the hornblende solid solution series, with very small amounts of actinolite and tremolite. Epidote also shows a wide compositional range, with Fe3+/(Al+Fe3+) ratios ranging from 0.01 to 0.49. Garnet is dominated by andradite and almandine associated with minor andradite grossular, almandine-pyrope, spessartine, pyrope and grossular. The occurrence of several heavy mineral types from the previous mineral groups, together with several morphological population of zircon and other minor and rare heavy minerals including andalusite, staurolite, kyanite, titanite (sphene), chromian spinel, biotite, chlorite and pyroxenes produce complex heavy mineral assemblages in the modern sediments of the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its modern fluvial sands, reflecting a mixing of detritus from heterogeneous sources that contain a variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks together with earlier sedimentary successions.The chemical and petrographic characteristics, as well as spatial distribution and concentration of heavy minerals in the study area, reflect the signatures of the local lithologies in the gulf hinterland, especially the Georgetown Inlier, Mt Isa Inlier and Coen Inlier-Carpentaria Basin divisions. However, the shelf sediments also contain ultrastable heavy minerals (zircon, tourmaline and rutile) that were probably derived from non-local sources by reworking of quartz sand from the northwestern shelf to the southeastern shelf and coastal environments of the gulf during the last marine transgression.The spatial distribution of heavy minerals in the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its surrounding river sediments is mainly influenced by the proximity of heterogeneous provenance areas, the high rate of fluvial supply caused by monsoon cycles, sea level change and hydrodynamic conditions. The spatial variability of heavy minerals forms a total of twelve distinct heavy mineral facies (identified through Q-mode cluster analysis) that characterise the surface and sub-surface sediments of the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria, as well as the fluvial sediments in the gulf hinterland.  The shelf surface facies include the surface of the northern submerged coral reef heavy mineral-free facies (SCRHMFF), the heavy mineral facies of the middle part of the southeastern shelf together with the surrounding area of the northern submerged coral reefs (MCRHMF), the Bryomol Reef heavy mineral facies (BRHMF) and the heavy mineral facies of the nearshore area together with the western margin of the middle part of the southeastern shelf (NWMHMF). The shelf sub-surface heavy mineral facies (SSHMF1-6) comprise three facies (SSHMF1-2 and SSHMF5) dominated by terrigenous sediments that reflect the signature of the adjacent sources, two reworked sub-surface heavy mineral facies (SSHMF3-4), and finally the heavy mineral-free SSHMF6 that mainly consists of calcareous marine sediments. The fluvial facies in the hinterland include the heavy mineral sedimentary succession facies (HMSSF) and the heavy mineral metamorphic inlier facies (HMMIF), the latter being divided into three distinct sub-facies (HMMIF1-3).The main source of terrigenous sediments in the studied shelf area is the fluvial HMMIF that drains the Coen Inlier-Carpentaria Basin, Georgetown Inlier and Mt Isa Inlier divisions, and the mixed source division of the Georgetown-Mt Isa Inliers-Great Australia Basin. This fluvial facies is characterised by high concentrations of metastable minerals, especially epidote and hornblende. The shelfal NWMHMF, SSHMF1-2 and SSHMF5 reflect the signature of this fluvial HMMIF. These shelfal facies suggest a high terrigenous input and direct filling of the fluvial channels within the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria during Holocene from the adjacent lithologies in the gulf hinterland, especially from the Gilbert, Norman, Flinders and Leichhardt Rivers. Also the shelfal MCRHMF reflects the signature of the fluvial HMMIF, with a significant contribution from the HMMIF1, suggesting reworking of terrigenous sediments by the clockwise tidal circulation pattern from the northeastern nearshore environment.The heavy mineral assemblages of the shelfal BRHMF and SSHM3-4 are characterised by the highest content of ultrastable heavy minerals, suggesting reworking of marine sediments from the northwestern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria during the post-glacial marine transgression that also increased the concentration of ultrastable heavy minerals in the MCRHMF. As a result of the clockwise tidal circulation pattern, the SSHMF3 probably received a mixture of reworked terrigenous sediments from the Archer, Coen and Coleman Rivers that drain the upper Coen Inlier-Carpentaria Basin division (HMMIF1) and the Wenlock River from the HMSSF. However, the BRHMF and SSHMF4 probably contain a mixture of reworked fluvial sediments from the entire HMMIF.The shelfal SCRHMFF and SSHMF6 are characterised by the absence of heavy minerals. Fine sediments were mainly removed by wave and current action during reef growth over several sea level cycles during the Quaternary. In addition, current strength and even storm conditions would be unable to lift heavy minerals to these elevated situations. As a result of the above processes and the positive relief of the reef surface, no heavy minerals were found in the very fine sand fraction on the reef surfaces.The strong affinity between the fluvial and shelfal heavy mineral facies is explained by the high rate of fluvial supply caused by monsoonal climate conditions. The expected effects of strong chemical weathering under humid tropical climate conditions over the gulf region are suppressed and diluted by the high rate of monsoonal river runoff that rapidly transports sediments along the rivers into the gulf.  Such a mechanism minimises the mineral residence time in the alluvial storage and thus reduces the effects of chemical weathering. Therefore, unstable heavy minerals are preserved together with stable and ultrastable minerals in the assemblages. The overall low feldspar weathering index supports the weathering-limited conditions, whereby the transportation processes are faster than the weathering rate.  Also, the short fluvial distances associated with this intense transportation reduce the effects of physical abrasion and thus minimises the loss of unstable minerals. Further, in addition to low chemical weathering caused by monsoonal climate conditions (dry for 8-9 months of the year), the dominance of physical disintegration in this tropical climate reduces the effects of weathering of exposed source rocks in the gulf hinterland. As a result of weathering-limited conditions and short fluvial transport distances, the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its hinterland form a set of unique tropical heavy mineral facies that reflect the signature of the local source lithologies.The relationship between the fluvial and shelfal surface and sub-surface heavy mineral facies identify pathways for marine sediment transport within the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Marine transport pathways are mainly controlled by the clockwise tidal circulation patterns within the gulf. In addition, cyclone conditions or large storm events are likely to enhance, but not control, the formation of the heavy mineral facies.Finally, the light mineral fractions in the study area are mostly quartz-dominated, except for the carbonate reef areas that are composed of shell materials. As a result of the limited differential hydrodynamic properties between the silicate- and carbonate-dominated particles, light mineral fractions in the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria and its hinterland provide poor mineralogical facies recognition. Therefore, heavy minerals are more effective than the light minerals in defining provenance, distribution patterns and transportation pathways in the southeastern shelf of the Gulf of Carpentaria.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the changes to Sri Lankan pre-service teachers' knowledge about teaching during their student teaching period</field><field name="creator">Wickramasinghe, N</field><field name="description">This study investigated how a group of Sri Lankan pre-service teachers changed their understanding of effective teaching during the twenty days student teaching (student teaching) period of their teacher preparation program. In order to explore changes in their understanding across this period, two methods were combined: concept maps and structured interviews. The study involved twelve student teachers preparing for teaching in secondary mathematics and science as participants. The student teachers were asked to draw concept maps of effective teaching three times: prior to beginning their student teaching period, in the middle of student teaching, and at end of the student teaching period. Half of the participants received their previous maps before developed their second and third concept maps; the other half drew their maps without reference to previous maps. Shortly after they drew their concept maps, participants were interviewed at these three stages. These interviews were audio recorded. Data were triangulated from concepts maps and interviews. Based on these data, multiple case studies were developed. Using qualitative analysis, these case studies were used to identify the changes in the student teachers&#65533; understanding about teaching and the factors that influenced these alternations. The results of the case studies were used to interpret patterns of change in participants&#65533; understanding about effective teaching. The prominent change across the maps was that over the time the participants&#65533; views of effective teaching had broadened significantly. The simple constructions of their first and second maps had become much more complex, with more concepts, more levels and more cross links. In their interviews, the student teachers provided some possible explanations for the changes, including the nature of their school experience, the support provided by workshops at their college and own their own reflections. On the basis of the these findings the study makes several recommendations for developing Sri Lankan teacher preparation and some directions for further research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing online learning environments for local contexts, as exemplified in the Sultanate of Oman</field><field name="creator">Hall, Andrea</field><field name="description">Online learning has a significant role in teaching and learning as it can be used to address the issues of quality and access to learning in higher education. However, for online learning to provide an effective solution, it needs to be designed to meet the learning needs of the students. This includes the consideration of their cultural preferences, as it is generally presumed that these significantly affect how people learn, and consequently affect learning success if courses are not designed appropriately.This is particularly important for the Sultanate of Oman, the focus of this study. Since Oman's renaissance in 1970, it has made impressive steps in the development of its education system from a mere three schools in 1970 to over a thousand in 2006 including over 20 higher education colleges and universities; but still faces the challenges of providing sufficient higher education and of sufficient quality for its rapidly expanding student population. If online learning is to be used to respond to these challenges, then the effect of cultural values and preferences must be considered in the way that learning is designed. However, there is little in the literature on how people in this culture learn, how they learn online, and how learning may be designed in a culturally-suitable manner. This is the problem investigated in the research: if culture does impact learning, how can learning be designed in a way that considers cultural values, and enables a successful learning experience? This thesis describes the development and refinement of design principles as an effective means to design culturally appropriate learning environments for higher education in the Sultanate of Oman.A Design-based Research approach was selected to for this study, as it can be used to develop a design solution that has been tested and refined in a genuine learning context, thus making the solution more useable and robust. This approach begins with the identification of the teaching and learning problem, then the proposal of a draft design solution from a literature review. This is followed with iterative testing in a genuine context, so that the theory is informed and modified in the learning environment. The final stage is the production of refined design guidelines and a modified learning environment that is specific for the context where it was tested.In this investigation, existing design models and principles were identified in the literature. These were used to develop design criteria to guide in the development of a design solution. From the literature review, concepts from Vygotsky&#8217;s sociocultural theory were extracted for the design solution as they were found to meet the design criteria more effectively than any other theories that were examined. The five online learning themes of social presence, interaction, collaboration, cognitive strategies, and student-centred learning were identified as a means to apply these theories to the learning design, and it was also found that these theories could be used to explain and verify cultural aspects of the learning design.From this theoretical basis, design guidelines were proposed for a specific context. The five online themes were used as a framework to develop guidelines that were developed from a literature review of learners&#8217; responses to the online environment. Cultural theories were also used to identify worldview and values of the Arabic society so that learning preferences and guidelines could be created for learners with this background. The guidelines were then used to develop an online course, and these became the prototype design solution. This solution was tested iteratively in a context in the Sultanate of Oman, using a case study strategy, during two three month online professional development courses for university faculty. During each research cycle, data analysis was used to modify the design guidelines which then were used to modify the learning environment. This resulted in the development of design guidelines modified by practice and a learning environment modified by theory. Iterative research ensured that the design guidelines continued to shape the learning environment and that this practical context continued to modify and adapt the theory so that with each cycle of research, both the guidelines and the learning environment became more culturally suitable for these particular learners.It was found that the refined guidelines developed in this research were consistent with, and extended, the existing models they built on. They were also able to apply cultural preferences to the design of the learning environment which became increasingly suitable for learners from an Oman cultural background. This provides convincing evidence that this research has provided an effective design solution for culturally appropriate learning design, and for the Sultanate of Oman, where the teaching and learning challenge was identified. It was also found that culture does impact learning significantly, and this emphasises the necessity of using design principles that account for culture and enable the challenges of quality and access to be met more effectively.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying wireless and mobile agent technologies for human decision making in the mission critical emergency environments</field><field name="creator">Pousti, Hamidreza</field><field name="description">Emergency response tasks, both military and civilian, occur in what are termed, 'Extreme Environments' characterised by uncertainty, high stress physical situations, and time sensitive decision-making. Emergency response crews in such environments need to be highly mobile, utilising a variety of advanced wireless technologies to communicate while accomplishing their assignments. It is crucial for the users in the field to be aware of their own situation and the situation in their vicinity to construct their own goals in coping with unpredictable conditions. These are problems identified in the Small Unit Operation (SUO) model used by the military in situations where people and equipment work together to meet some mission objective. These entities may have distinct roles and information needs, and are often geographically distributed. Moreover, other groups of users in the command and control (C2) position need to have an overall and clear picture of the current state of the operation, at the necessary level of detail, in order to make the proper decisions based upon different types of information they receive and their own knowledge. To tackle these issues, users face challenges concerned with the responsible for handling data through volatile wireless network connections and narrow bandwidth conditions. These conditions pose new challenges for all parties of users in terms of situation-awareness, sensemaking, reliable decision making and consequent actions. The aim of this research is to focus on technologies that can help decision makers in two ways: reduce the level of environmental uncertainty, and provide better situation awareness and sensemaking for individuals and teams in extreme environments. These technologies are studied in the light of human sensemaking requirements and the factors contributing to human cognitive states, especially in time critical situations. To achieve this aim, a secondary case study was carried out to identify various user requirements in dynamic environments, and the ways technologies can address those needs. Results show that many new wireless technologies, such as those based on Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio, demonstrate considerable potential for emergency response tasks circumstances. Furthermore, software agents show potential for deployment in emergency tasks to reduce the degree of uncertainty. Software mobile agents also show potential to improve the accuracy and agility of operations along with the ability to deal with the volatile wireless networks. The way decision makers understand their environmental states is vital for the success of emergency response operations. This understanding depends on the human capabilities of interpretation of information, as well as the memory and knowledge of decision makers at the moment the information is received. Thus, human issues need to be understood alongside the advances in technology. The potential contributions of the concept of mobile agents in this area is significant, especially where software mobile agents work as autonomous entities in order to handle the task and local decisions, on behalf of mobile emergency response crews. These findings draw attention to the significant role of software mobile agents working in a meshed wireless network. They could provide an ubiquitous network in an extreme environment. They also have the capability of supporting users' situation awareness, sensemaking and critical decision making, vital in emergency response environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The character and genesis of pedogenic calcrete in southern Australia</field><field name="creator">Grevenitz, Paul</field><field name="description">Pedogenic calcrete profiles from temperate, semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia show a diversity of forms, both in large-scale structure and texture determined in the field, and microstructures as determined by thin-section and scanning electron microscopy. Accumulations of microcrystalline calcite with varying degrees of cementation are typical of the majority of samples regardless of texture or form. Calcified filaments are prevalent at a micro-scale in the upper sections of most profiles, occurring as laminated coatings and channel infillings in hardpan calcrete, pisoliths and nodules. Organic matter occurring as filamentous and dendritic masses is commonly found associated with the calcified filaments and the formation and growth of the filaments are considered to cause the brecciated and pisolitic textures common in mature pedogenic calcrete.Rhizogenic calcrete occurs in various host materials as taproot fragments with either dense grey micritic cement and microspar crystals which are larger adjacent to enclosed quartz grains, mottled dense micritic and microsparitic calcrete or alveolarlike fabrics. Root-formed channels are also prevalent in many indurated nodular and hardpan samples. Discrete and incipient calcrete nodules containing alveolar fabrics and microcodium grains and platy pedogenic calcrete containing fenestral microfabric were also observed. Needle-fibre calcite is present as the dominant component in some profiles, occurring as discontinuous semi-indurated channel fillings and sheets. The morphology of their occurrence suggests rhizogenic influence in their formation. The collected samples are analysed for stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition in order to determine if there are detectable differences across regions of different climate and host material. Many samples show within-sample variability with biogenic or rhizogenic features co-existing with micritic overgrowths and cements. In order to examine the relationship between pedogenic calcrete type and method of formation, carbon and oxygen isotopic measurements were taken from numerous sub samples within each sample to determine the extent of variation in isotopic composition within individual samples. The total spread of values is -1.0 to -12.5% and 2.0 to -10% (standard delta notation versus PDB) for carbon and oxygen isotopic composition, respectively, for all samples with large sample variation and positive covariation as displayed by multiple sample aliquots commonly observed. The results suggest within-sample variation caused by different and coexisting cement types, with contribution of heavy carbon by calcified filaments and carbonate precipitated through carbon dioxide degassing, and light carbon contributed by rhizogenic influences. The positive co-variation in carbon and oxygen is not depth related and indicates a simple mixing line between two end-members with differing isotopic compositions, possibly due to concomitant evaporative enrichment and carbon dioxide degassing in different carbonate cement phases. Soil organic matter carbon analysed for isotopic composition shows relative little variation across the climatic zones and no correlation with coexisting carbonate carbon isotopic composition.Selected pedogenic calcrete samples developed in soils overlying radiogenic basement rocks from sites in arid and semi-arid western South Australia and Western Australia are analysed for 87Sr/86Sr in order to evaluate the contribution of calcium derived from silicate weathering to pedogenic calcrete. Fresh parent materials collected at the sites show 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.7100 to 0.7993 and pedogenic calcrete 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.7106 to 0.7198. Samples from sites in coastal and inland South Australia have 87Sr/86Sr ratios close to marine values (0.8093) indicating low calcium contribution from bedrock. Samples fromWestern Australia have variable and higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios indicating considerable calcium input for parent material and bedrock. Whole rock pedogenic calcrete and host material sampled in profiles were analysed by X-ray diffraction to determine mineralogical composition and then determine relative changes in carbonate composition within the profile. Samples were further analysed by instrumental neutron activation analysis for a suite of major and trace elements and subjected to a variety of statistical tests to determine the phase relationships of the elements to each other and, in particular, calcium within the pedogenic calcrete profile. Most elements are found to be associated with residual phases such as clay, feldspar and iron oxide correlation to calcium, in some samples, and therefore are of possible interest in geochemical exploration as pathfinder elements in the search for buried ore deposits.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence speaks volumes - the deaf experience of mental health, culture and communication</field><field name="creator">Rodrigues, Otilia</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore the world of deafness and to identify the major issues that beset deaf people. The experience of deaf people is largely unknown by the hearing world, partly because of the unimaginable nature of the reality of deafness (unlike blindness which, to some extent at least, can be easily simulated, though blindness from birth cannot), partly because deafness is not immediately visible and partly because the communication issues are so complex. The thesis begins with an historical view of deafness to provide a rationale for the way in which deaf people are understood and treated today and then moves on to identify the most serious and far-reaching issues that affect the lives of this population. Health and mental health, language, education, communication and cultural issues are explored in depth and their importance compared. Cultural issues emerge as a special complexity as Deaf* communities have strong difficulties in being recognised as a culture as opposed to a disabled minority. To overcome this, a paradigm shift is needed whereby Deaf people can be viewed as both a separate culture and a normal population within a wellness model. A theoretical framework, Personal Construct Theory, is proposed as a theoretical approach that will validate Deaf experience and also provide an explanation of the hearing world&#8217;s interpretation of Deafness. It is proposed that this framework provides both a bridge for more effective communication and useful clinical perspectives, thereby providing the context for the paradigm shift that is needed. Three studies are presented. Study 1 establishes the extent of the problems associated with diagnosis of health and mental health problems; Study 2 presents an initial strategy to combat diagnostic issues by translating a widely used diagnostic mental xiv health test into Auslan (Australian Sign Language) using a CD-ROM format and trialling the test with a pilot group; Study 3 presents an exploration of the ways in which Deaf and hearing people interpret themselves and one another using the Personal Construct Theory framework. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the ways in which this research contributes to the paradigm shift that will change the perception of deafness and the social conditions related to this population. *&#8221;D&#8221; Deaf is used to refer to the culture of deaf people; &#8220;d&#8221; deaf is used to refer to the physiological (audiological) condition of deafness.

This study examines the relationship between the nature of different types of recasts and learner uptake in response to those recasts within Korean college students' dyadic interactions while learning English as a foreign language. The two types of dyadic pairings consisted of NNS learner - NNS learner and NNS teacher - NNS learner. The study explores the differences between recasts provided by the learners and those provided by the teacher in response to their interlocutors' non-target-like utterances. Also, the relationship between those recasts and learner uptake in the two different dyadic interactions is examined.Eighteen students who enrolled in an English conversation course at a university in South Korea and the researcher as a teacher took part in the study. During regular class time, learners formed pairs and worked on four information gap activities. The collaborative work in all dyads was audio tape-recorded, transcribed and coded for the types of students' uptake following various types of recasts provided by NNS interlocutors in response to different types of partners' non-target-like utterances.The findings show that NNS interlocutors used and provided three types of recasts: 'Reformulation', 'Repetition followed by Reformulation', and 'Overlap Reformulation' in both teacher - learner (T - L) and learner - learner (L - L) interactions. 'Reformulation' recast type was more frequently used in response to learners' non-target-like forms in both interactional contexts. Recasts by the teacher and by peer interlocutors were mainly directed to negotiation of morpho-syntactic linguistic features. Unlike their interactions with the teacher, peer interlocutors in L - L interactions reacted with more frequent recasts in response to inaccurate lexical utterances. Learner uptake varied depending on recasts provided by the teacher and by peers and the types of recasts in terms of immediate incorporation. The nature of learner uptake appeared to be influenced by the nature of the recasts according to the frequency, the length and the saliency of recasts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation for state space models: quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches</field><field name="creator">Al zghool, Raed Ahmad Hasan</field><field name="description">In this thesis, parameter estimation for multivariate heteroscedastic models with unspecified correlations is considered. Two alternative approaches for estimating the state variables and unknown parameters in non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models with unspecified correlations are developed; these are the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood methods.Quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches have been found to be useful in parameter estimation, especially when the underlying system dynamic probability distribution cannot be fully specified. The quasi-likelihood method relaxes the distributional assumptions and only assumes knowledge of the first two conditional moments. A limitation of quasi-likelihood is that the nature of the conditional covariance matrix is not always known. An alternative approach, asymptotic quasi-likelihood is described. Semiparametric treatment is considered in this thesis. It involves a nonparametric kernel approach to estimating the unknown covariance matrix and it integrates the estimation of the covariance matrix with the standard quasi-likelihood approach.Applications of the quasi likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches to state space models are demonstrated via simulation studies. One simulation study based on the Poisson model and another based on the basic stochastic volatility model are presented. Results from these simulation studies show that the performance of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches are comparable to other methods, with no knowledge required of the underlying system&#8217;s probability structure.Sensitivity of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood estimation procedures to initial values assigned to state variables and starting parameters is investigated. A suggestion on choosing the initial value of state variables, without knowing the system&#8217;s probability structure is given. Standard steps used to improve the grid search method for obtaining better estimation of unknown parameters, in nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space models, are established.Finally techniques developed in this thesis are applied to real data. Three datasets are considered: (i) the daily exchange rate of US Dollar/Australian Dollar and British Pound/Australian Dollar for the period from 1/1/2003 to 1/1/2006; (ii) the monthly number of cases of poliomyelitis reported by the U.S. Center for Disease Control for the years 1970 to 1983 and (iii) the exchange rates of Pound/Dollar from 1/10/81 to 28/6/85. Results, including residual analysis for the various modelling approaches, demonstrate that techniques developed in this thesis are applicable and have advantages when compared with other technical approaches.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactive decision support systems and activity theory: a population projection flow model for strategic planning in education</field><field name="creator">Gould, Edward</field><field name="description">Population modeling is an important component in educational decision support systems.

The approach taken is to use an interactive human-centred computerized solution so that demographers can make full use of their local knowledge, intuition and experience.  Because of the interactive nature of the model, concentration is focused on the active position of the user.

The little discussion there is, merges the Bougainville campaign with the Australian army's other final campaigns, which have all been dismissed as just 'mopping-up' operations. The Bougainville campaign deserves to be remembered. This thesis is an examination of the campaign fought on Bougainville. It has a clear operational framework and adapted the methodology developed by Peter Stanley in Tarakan, which contrasts and explores the experiences of the commanders with those of the men. Time is spent developing the personalities and characteristics of the various commanders as this influenced the decisions made during the campaign. Each commander had his own strengths and weaknesses; each had his own peculiarities and eccentricities. The Corps commander, for example, micromanaged the campaign even down to the level of platoon, while one infantry brigadier was widely recognised as being 'mad'. Some commanders were keen to commence the campaign and engage the Japanese, and pushed their men into battle accordingly. Yet others were less than enthusiastic and resented serving in militia units. The view of the men was very different to that of their commanders. Tactics, strategy and commanders' idiosyncrasies, meant little to the men who did the fighting and dying. This thesis also examines the experiences of the men, their thoughts, feelings and fears. It gives a sense of jungle warfare and the nature of the fighting: the strain of patrolling, the fear of constant Japanese attacks, and the men's reaction to combat. From a close study of the commanders and men, two sub-themes have also emerged as they appeared throughout the campaign. The first was the ever-present AIF and militia debate. The Bougainville campaign demonstrated that the rivalry between the two groups had not completely dissipated with the creation of the AMF and was, in fact, still an emotive issue in 1945. The second was the legacy of the First AIF, the prevalence of the 'Anzac legend' and the 'Digger myth', and the 'big-noting' Australian soldiers in official reports and unit war diaries. Although the focus of the thesis is on the Australians, some attention is also given to the Japanese and the Bougainville Islanders.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Returning to the Scene of the Crime: The Brothers Grimm and the Yearning for Home</field><field name="creator">Clack, Maureen</field><field name="description">Almost two hundred years ago, in 1812, two German brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, collected folk stories, and revised and published them in a book of fairy tales. The publication, Grimm's Fairy Tales, remains amongst the best sellers in contemporary western children's literature despite increasing feminist concerns that the tales deliver outdated and inappropriate patriarchal messages. This thesis seeks to discover what other messages are contained in the tales that are enticing and strong enough to over-rule the well supported feminist warnings. Considering that most support for the tales praises their value in regard to the psychological development of children, and acknowledging the psychological premise that childhood experiences determine later adult behaviour, this paper proposes that events in the Grimm Brothers' own childhood dictated the themes of the tales and the messages they contain. After establishing the connection between fairy tales and the crime fiction genre and then providing a forensic reading of the tales, a less emotive reading which isolates the various parts of the story and sifts through the details for hidden evidence, this paper will show that the death of their father in Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's early years, and the consequent loss of the family home and social status, together with the responsibility that these events placed on their young shoulders, provided the reoccurring theme of the tales: the attempt by a young protagonist to regain or replace a lost home, and to re-establish a family. A similar forensic review of artwork by several contemporary visual artists who have used childhood as a theme for their work further demonstrates that childhood trauma can be a catalyst for creative practice. The works investigated in this paper were selected from two contemporary exhibitions: Scene of the Crime, Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, Los Angeles, 1997; and Mixed-up Childhood, Auckland Art Gallery, 2005. In addition to these works several of Louise Bourgeois' sculptures and drawings which, by her own admission, refer to unhappy childhood memories are compared and contrasted with the works constructed by Javier Lara Gomez, who created happy and peaceful 'homes' from memory and longing whilst an inmate in Sydney's Long Bay maximum security prison. Reflecting the Grimm's creative endeavours and the practice of the visual artists whose work is discussed in the paper, the artworks in the accompanying exhibition, Defective Stories, investigate the conflicting construct of home as a haven and home as a site of trauma, in fairy tales and our own childhood experiences. By launching a forensic investigation into the role of the home in Australian society from the early days of colonial settlement to the present, a period of approximately two hundred years which corresponds to the lifetime of Grimm's Fairy Tales, the paper will also demonstrate that the psychological need for a safe haven is inherent in all humans, child or adult. Furthermore, it will explain how a capitalist society that depends on consumption for survival exploits this need through the exaggeration of external dangers and the promotion of products that promise security. Adults are enticed to invest in larger, safer homes, which are increasingly self contained and ensure protection from the supposed threats of an alternative society while the financial and emotional pressures of such existence create a bubbling pot of tension within those walls; children are cajoled by fairy tales that convince them they are able to secure and defend their own safe haven (and themselves) in a threatening world when the adult population fails them.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening comprehension processes and strategies of Japanese junior high school students in interactive settings</field><field name="creator">Tokeshi, Masanori</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of interactive listening and the characteristics of listening comprehension processes for Japanese junior high school students of English. The first aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between the learner&#8217;s listening strategies and the speaker&#8217;s speech modifications and non-linguistic cues. The second aim was to investigate the listening comprehension processes and listening strategies used by the participants. The methodology employed was primarily qualitative. The literature on listening comprehension models, research areas of difficulties with listening and speech modifications and strategy research were chiefly reviewed. Six selected Japanese junior high school case study students (from a population N=19) and a native speaker (Assistant Language Teacher) participated in this study. Three different types of listening tasks were used to elicit the data. The data collection was mainly based on stimulated recall procedures and task observation. The data analysis followed grounded theory methodology. The first part of the data analysis indicated that concrete visual referents, contextual cues and speech modifications accompanied by gestures were conductive to listening comprehension for basic level listeners. The data indicated that bottom-up processing and top-down processing interacted with each other. The participants were likely to pay selective attention to an individual known word (s). The second part of the analysis identified 25 types of listening strategies and categorized them as the metacognitive strategies, cognitive strategies and social/affective strategies. The use of listening strategies was shown to greatly depend on task type, L2 proficiency, context and listener&#8217;s affective factors. The data also showed that interactive listening as a collaborative process between the listener and speaker to enhances comprehensibility. Repetition by a native speaker was found to be the most effective cue for listening comprehension, while elaboration was the least effective. A major implication of this study is that greater emphasis on interactive listening would promote the communicative language ability of Japanese students of English in their English lessons.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of natural catchments on lag parameters</field><field name="creator">Bodhinayake, Nanayakkara Dayananda</field><field name="description">Catchment lag time is considered as a key factor in flood hydrograph modelling and design. The extensive literature investigation of this study revealed that most of the lag time equations that have been developed include various hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of the catchment. However, different studies use different combinations of these variables, and therefore, the appropriate context of the relation is not known with confidence. The intention of this research is to determine to what extent the above mentioned catchment characteristics influence the lag parameter, which is directly related to the catchment&#8217;s lag time. In order to assess the influence of catchment characteristics on the lag parameter, reliable and valid rainfall and flow data must be analysed. Therefore, at the outset of this research, the reliability and validity of rainfall data of seventeen rural catchments in Queensland, Australia, were examined. These catchments belong to five river basins and they are, Mary, Haughton, Herbert, Don and Johnstone. A total of 254 storm events on these catchments were analysed. To compute the lag parameters of the catchments, the computer based Watershed Bounded Network Model (WBNM) was selected due to its in-built non-linearity property as well as other capabilities. These include the ability to model spatially varying rainfall, the simplicity of data files and the requirement of a minimum amount of data. The constantslope method was adopted to separate the base flow from the recorded total hydrograph in order to derive the ordinates of the surface runoff hydrograph, which is one of the essential components for the input file of WBNM. The time variation of the rainfall was examined by means of mass curves of rainfall and the spatial variability of the rainfall was studied with the help of isohyetal plots. Thereafter the rainfall and flow data, as well as the physical features of the catchments, were incorporated into WBNM to generate hydrographs for all 254 storm events. The lag parameter was altered until WBNM generated a hydrograph that closely resembled the recorded surface runoff hydrograph. This process was repeated for each storm event to obtain its lag parameter value. From this method, lag parameter values were derived for all 254 storm events on the seventeen catchments. The next stage of the analysis involved testing to determine whether the lag parameter is related to a range of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological variables. To carry out the analysis the necessary hydrological characteristics were extracted from the storm data. Other useful geomorphological and climatological characteristics were obtained from AUSLIG maps and the Bureau of Meteorology. If the lag relations built into WBNM are sufficient to account for those variables, then no significant relation between the lag parameter and those variables should exist when the lag parameter is plotted against each variable. The lag parameter (C) versus a range of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of all seventeen catchments were plotted to examine their correlation. Two tailed statistical t-tests were carried out for each plot to find out whether the gradients of best-fit straight lines of those plots are significantly different from zero at 5% level of significance. The results of this research have shown that there are no strong relationships between the lag parameter (C) and the range of catchment characteristics selected for this study. Therefore, the lag parameter can be considered as an independent factor applying to a wide range of catchments. While this research was carried out for the WBNM model, its essential findings, that the non-linearity power is near to 0.23, and that the dominant variable influencing catchment lag time is the catchment area, also apply to other flood hydrograph models.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis and semantic file systems</field><field name="creator">Martin, Ben</field><field name="description">The thesis is that a branch of discrete mathematics, Formal Concept Analysis, when applied to Semantic File Systems can lead to an improved personal information space.

Bi-2212/USr2CaO6, Bi-2212/MgO, Bi-2212/CeO2 and Bi-2212/Ag composites were made with varying concentrations of impurities. The MR effects of these composites were characterized and compared to that of pure Bi-2212 and that of the other composites. The resistivity of the Bi-2212 composites with the exception of the Bi-2212/CeO2 and Bi-2212/Ag can be characterized by a high sensitivity to applied magnetic field over an increasing temperature range with increasing impurities concentrations up to a percolative limit. Bi-2212/CeO2 composites display a highly insulating behavior indicative of a breached percolative limit while the Bi-2212/Ag composite displays a decreased resistance as the Ag improves conductivity with the HTS. X-ray results show the compatibility of the added impurities with the stability of the Bi-2212 matrix in all cases except CeO2 addition during the melt texturing (MT) process.

The recent anthropogenic depletion of stratospheric ozone has resulted in elevated levels of potentially damaging UV-B to which organisms are exposed, and global climate change many also herald changes in environmental conditions, particularly temperature, precipitation, and sea level. Thus, organisms may be simultaneously exposed to variable environmental stressors. In the marine environment, embryos and larvae are likely the most vulnerable to the negative effects of these stresses. Moreover, intertidal organisms are particularly vulnerable to UVR because they occur in habitats where little or no UVR is absorbed by the water column, and the effects of UVR are coupled with other potential negative stresses associated with low tides. Surprisingly, little is known about the effects of potential interactions between environmental stressors on marine larvae, particularly involving UVR. This study aims to investigate the role of UVR in the development of encapsulated intertidal embryos through a series of six independent experiments that screen a large number of taxa. In the first four experiments, I explored the direct effects of UVR in isolation and with other stressors (UVR/temperature/salinity and UVR/desiccation), as well as the indirect effects of UVR and fouling. Isolated effects of UVR were investigated on egg masses from 23 marine gastropod species collected from three intertidal habitats (full sun, partial shade, full shade) and exposed to four spectral treatments (full spectrum, no UV-B, no UVR, dark). Embryos from full shade habitats were significantly vulnerable to UVR while those from full sun habitats showed no significant mortality differences between special treatments. Multifactorial experiments were then conducted in which encapsulated embryos of three common rocky shore gastropods were exposed to simultaneous combinations (i) UVR, temperature, and salinity and (ii) UVR and desiccation. Siphonaria denticulate and Bembicium nanum embryos were expected to be tolerant to these negative interactions of stressors as they are routinely deposited on rock platforms exposed to solar radiation. In contrast, Dolabrifera brazieri embryos were predicted to be vulnerable to these stressors as they are deposited in shaded, submerged habitats. I detected species-specific synergistic effects of these stressors, and increases in mortality and retardation of development were generally associated with the most physiologically stressful conditions. Based on laboratory results, embryos of D. brazieri were the most sensitive to all the stressors. In contrast, S. denticulate and B. nanum were vulnerable to negative effects associated with synchronous spectral, thermal, and salinity stress; but they were relatively tolerant to UVR and desiccation. Nevertheless, field results indicate that embryos of these species within desiccated habitats have a significantly higher mortality than those within submerged habitats, suggesting that development on rock platform surfaces may not be optimal for these embryos. The indirect effects of UVR and fouling on encapsulated larval development were investigated on egg masses from 18 species cultured under three spectral treatments (full spectrum, no UV, dark). Algal fouling levels, protest colonization, embryonic mortality, and encapsulation period were recorded, and I found that UVR inhibited algal growth and protest colonization on egg mass surfaces. Although algal fouling was not directly related to embryonic mortality in most species, egg masses colonized by protists had a higher level of algal fouling; and overall, these egg masses had a significantly higher incidence of embryonic mortality. In the last two experiments, I examined potential behavioural and biochemical protection afforded to encapsulated intertidal embryos against UV-induced damage. I conducted surveys of intertidal egg masses in south-eastern Australia over two years to determine if spatial and temporal variation in parental site selection could reduce potential environmental stress to encapsulated embryos. I predicted that eff masses would be predominantly deposited in shaded habitats not prone to environmental extremes. Furthermore, I anticipated that egg masses deposited on rock platform surfaces would be smaller and occur less frequently in these habitats during seasons of high environmental stress. As predicted, most species spawned under boulders, thereby minimizing exposure to environmental stress. Analyses confirmed that summer had the highest UVR index, water temperature, and air temperature, as well as the lowest tides; but assemblages and abundances of egg masses on exposed rock platforms were highest during summer with no change in egg mass sizes. Thus, species spawning on rock platform surfaces do not seem to confer protection to their encapsulated offspring by avoidance of physiologically stressful times or conditions. Alternatively, one or more of these potential stressors are beneficial to embryonic development, and these benefits outweigh negative effects. For example, high temperatures associated with direct sunlight may increase developmental rate and counteract any negative effects associated with UVR. Potential biochemical protection against UV-induced damage was examine by quantifying potential chemical sunscreens, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), in intertidal egg masses from 46 mollusc species, two polychaete species, and one fish species from southeastern Australia. Analyses revealed that egg mass maturity and spawning habitat did not significantly affect MAA composition with egg masses. In contrast, adult diet, phylogeny, and viability significantly affected MAA composition. Herbivores had significantly higher levels of certain MAAs than carnivores, and viable egg masses had higher levels of some MAAs than inviable egg masses. MAAs also occurred in relatively high concentrations in molluscan egg masses when compared to adult mollusks and other common intertidal organisms. Despite the complexity of factors affecting MAA composition, the prevalence of MAAs in some species is consistent with protection afforded to offspring against negative effects of UVR. Results from the experiments comprising this study indicate that encapsulated embryos use behavioural and biochemical protection against UVR and related stressors; and the presence and effectiveness of these mechanisms may be species-specific. Similarly, the species-specific effects of UVR highlight the importance of research on a range of species. Furthermore, the complex outcomes observed on applying multiple stressors could not have been predicted from examining environmental variables in isolation. Results from the single factor study here suggest that UVR does not negatively affect embryos of species that spawn in full sun, but multifactorial experiments revealed that UVR can indeed have negative effects when other stressors are considered. Hence, we may be dramatically underestimating the ecological impacts of climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion by failing to consider the complex interplay of combinations of environmental variables with organisms.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal history and geological controls on the distribution of coal seam gases in the southern Sydney Basin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Faiz, Mohinudeen Mohamed</field><field name="description">Coal seams of the southern Sydney Basin contain large volumes of gas, mainly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (C02) with subordinate volumes of longer chain hydrocarbons (C2+) and nitrogen (Nz). Data from exploration boreholes, underground mines and laboratory sorption-desorption tests are used to investigate the composition and distribution of gases in the coal seams. The influences of thermal history, coal composition, rank, geological structure, stratigraphy and igneous activity are evaluated.The coals of the Late Permian lllawarra Coal Measures attained ranks of up to medium- and low volatile bituminous coals as a result of high palaeo-heat flows (up to 2.5 HFU) and deep burial (up to 2500 m) in the Cretaceous. During the interval between Early Triassic and Middle Jurassic, large volumes of COz and H20 and subsidiary amounts of hydrocarbons were generated by coalification. The major phase of CH4 and other hydrocarbon generation occurred between the Middle Jurassic and Late Cretaceous at burial depths between 1.5 krn and 2.5 km.The gas retention and emission characteristics of coals are primarily dependent on pore-size distribution. The Permian coals studied composed of mostly vitrinite and inertinite and the porosity of these coals is dominated by micro- and meso-pores &#171; 50 nm). Pores associated with the mineral matter are mainly macro-pores (&gt; 50 nm) hence the presence of mineral matter in coal relatively decreases its micro-porosity.The gas sorption in coals mainly occurs in the micro-pores and increases with fixed carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and content but decreases with increasing mineral matter, volatile matter and moisture content. The CO2 sorption capacity of coal is between two to three times higher than that for C~. Coal also desorbs CO2 at a significantly higher rate than CH4&#8226; For a given gas, the desorption rates are related to the abundance of macro-pores and fractures and accordingly increases with mineral matter and vitrinite content. Hence the residual gas content decreases with the increasing COz, mineral matter and vitrinite content.CH4 and longer chain hydrocarbons presently occurring within the Illawarra Coal Measures were generated during coalification, whereas most of the COz was introduced into the sequence in association with the periodic igneous activity since the Middle Jurassic. Most of the CO2 generated during the early stages of coalification have been expelled from the coal measures.  The variations in the gas composition are mainly related to structural features and depth; the volume of CO2 increases towards structural highs with highest concentration occurring in anticlines and near some faults. Structural lows contain dominantly CH4 but local pockets of CO2 sometimes occur adjacent to faults and dykes. Furthermore, in majority of the boreholes, the volume of CO2 increases with decreasing depth. These variations are mainly related to the migration and solubility properties of CO2.The quantity of ethane and longer chain hydrocarbons occurring at depths less than 500m is very small &#171; 0.1%) but increases with depth. It is postulated that this trend is related to theready expulsion of most of the early-formed longer chain hydrocarbons from shallow depths and the subsequent invasion by later-formed CH4.The total in-situ gas content of coal, measured from core desorption test, varies from &lt; 1 m'It to 20 m3/t. The desorbable gas content at depths shallower than 200 m is negligible but, on average, increases by approximately 4 m'It per 100m in increase depth up to 600 m, and thereafter the rate of increases is significantly low. However, at a given depth, individual values can show up to 80% variability depending on gas composition, geological structure, coal composition and rank. Elevated gas contents occur where the gas is dominantly CO2 whereas anomalously low gas contents occur near highly faulted zones.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hidden in the sands of time: geoarchaeology of sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ward, Ingrid A</field><field name="description">This geoarchaeological study aims to establish the geomorphic context of Aboriginal cultural landscapes and archaeological sites in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, over the Late Quaternary. The geomorphic focus of the thesis is concentrated on the sand sheets, which occur at the base of the sandstone escarpments. Sample locations include the occupation (rockshelter and sand sheet) sites of Goorurarmum, Jinmium and Karlinga, and non-occupation(creek) sites at Karlinga and Sandy Creek Gorge. The thesis presents five interrelated studies, including (i) an assessment of the theoretical relevance of geoarchaeology in northern Australia; and three studies at different timescales, evaluating (ii) long-term landscape processes over timescales of millenia using in situ osmogenic dating, (iii) sedimentary processes over timescales of centuries to millenia using luminescence dating, and sedimentary processes over decadal timescales. A fifth study integrates the results of the above four studies with existing archaeological data. Measurement of in-situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations from the local escarpment bedrock has revealed denudation rates of 4 - 7 mm.ka-1 over 103 &#8211; 105 year timescales, consistent with similar studies in other parts of semi-arid Australia. Calculated bedrock denudation rates were used to model burial profiles up to 6 m deep from the Jinmium sand sheet. Measured concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in two profiles, provided vertical accretion rates of ~10 - 20 mm.ka-1 over the past few hundred thousand years. Grain size, micromorphology, mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that the sand-sheet sediments are locally sourced. The rock-shelter sediments have higher relative concentrations of CaO, P205 and greater LOI, than the surrounding sand-sheet sediments, reflecting higher levels of charcoal, guano and organic matter. Post-depositional reddening of the sediments reflects groundwater variation rather than any proxy for depositional age. A total of 33 thermoluminescence (TL) and 15 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from the rock-shelters, sand sheets and creek embankments. U- and Th-series analyses indicate relative equilibrium, with slightly higher dose rates (3.0 &#177; 0.83 Gy.ky-1) for mottled sediments than elsewhere (1.3 &#177; 0.29 Gy.ky-1). Foreshortened TL plateaux in some sand sheet sediments at Goorurarmum and Jinmium, and stepped TL plateaux in the sediments alongside Sandy Creek are indicative of episodic rapid deposition events. Basal OSL ages for the Goorurarumum rock shelter and adjacent sand sheet excavation are 0.3 &#177; 0.07 ky BP and 14.3 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively, and near-basal OSL ages for the Karlinga rock shelter and more distant sand sheet excavation are 18.4 &#177; 5.4 ky BP and 18.0 &#177; 0.6 ky BP respectively. The 18 ka age for the Karlinga rock shelter is uncertain, and a much younger basal radiocarbon age of ~ 4 ka is preferred. The deepest OSL ages for the Karlinga creek profile (KR99CP) and Sandy Creek Gorge profile is 8.6 &#177; 0.3 ky BP and 13.9 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively. An increase in the sand sheet accumulation rates from ~ 100 mm.ka-1 in the late Pleistocene to over 200 mm.ka-1 in the Holocene is interpreted to reflect enhanced monsoonal activity following postglacial marine transgression rather than human activity. The preceding results are integrated with information from radiocarbon analyses, regional archaeology, and local palaeobotanical, stone artefact and rock-art studies. Chronological results support initial evidence of seed processing, stone point production, and rock art around 3 &#8211; 4 ka. However, it is questioned whether these trends reflect &#8216;intensification&#8217; or preservation and sorting of the archaeological records. The combined chronological data from the Keep River region indicates that although there is evidence of occupation from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the majority of occupation deposits in the Keep River region are Holocene in age. However, this is biased by the greater number of rock shelter sequences sampled and by the poor preservation potential of the semi-arid monsoonal climate which favours younger sediment sequences. Better preservation of older sequences is found in open sites. The overall geoarchaelogical history describes a relatively insensitive sedimentary record of the comparatively sensitive Aboriginal occupation of the sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region. Scope remains for further multi-disciplinary geoarchaeological nvestigations in similar semi-arid monsoonal environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the case flow management and case tracking systems of the Central Administrative Court of Thailand with those of the Federal Court of Australia, with reference to practice in the USA</field><field name="creator">Vsindilok, Natacha</field><field name="description">Case flow management (CFM) is recognised as an essential component for the success of the overall management in contemporary courts. Case flow management programmes are adopted and implemented in many courts and tribunals across many nations to improve the courts&#65533; supervision of time and events from the beginning of cases to their finalisation. The case tracking system (CTS) is the most common tool in an automated case flow management system, providing crucial information to trace and track cases. The Administrative Court of Thailand and the Office of the Administrative Courts employ two such systems to promote overall court management. They are keen to improve and adjust the case tracking system, which is the main tool the Administrative Court's judges and executive judges employ in supervising case progress and enhancing the courts&#65533; overall capacity. The central aim of this thesis is to make a contribution to the improvement of the case flow and case tracking systems of the Administrative Court. With this goal in sight, the thesis examines various aspects of the two systems in three stages. The first stage is the investigation of general principles, objectives and practices from United States of America perspective and a comparison of general principles, objectives and practices between those of the Federal Court of Australia (representing common law and adversarial systems) and the Thai Administrative Court (representing civil law and inquisitorial systems). The comparative study between the two courts includes the historical background of the establishment of these courts and their case flow management and case tracking systems. The implementation of the case flow management and case tacking systems of the Administrative Court is analysed from the perspectives of three groups of users: judges, case officials and parties to cases. Interviews were conducted with selected judges and high-ranking court officials on various aspects of court policy and practice. Methodologically, I view the interviews are used as a primary source of data. The opinions of non-executive judges and case officials on various issues of the Court's case flow and case management systems were sought by questionnaire. The questionnaires were also distributed to parties who have experienced the Court's case management in order to gain the perspectives of an external group. Consequently, the actual implementation of the Court's policies in the two systems and the perceptions of the efficiency and achievements of such systems are explored in a practical way. A review of the literature was conducted and interviews undertaken with selected experts in court and case management in the Federal Court. The aim of these theoretical and comparative stages was to provide a thorough understanding of the Administrative Court and its case flow management and case tracking systems. Finally, the thesis attempts to identify the shortcomings of the case flow management and case tracking systems which emerge from the results of the two earlier stages of this study. Recommendations are then made to improve the functioning of the two systems in various areas. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the CFM can be developed in specific ways in the following areas: (i) timestandards for case flow management; (ii) timestandards for case finalisation: (iii) standards for monthly judicial output; (iv) investigation of the scope of the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by judges and case officials and the establishment of a 'Settlement Division' for dealing with the suitable administrative cases; (v) adoption and adjustment of differentiated case management (DCM) techniques; and (vi) 'Administrative Case System Programme (ACSP) Improvement Plan'. Suggested core measures to achieve the overall objectives of the implementation of the case flow management systems are to: (i) provide education to the public and encourage and increase parties' accountability, (ii) implement and enforce the suggested timestandards for case flow management and the suggested timestandards on case finalisation, (iii) enhance judicial knowledge by a 'peer group educating system', (iv) refine the case allocation system by employing an adjusted DCM technique and a nominating system, (v) standardise the judges' managerial role by enforcing suggested timestandards and by forming a research group to develop models for judge's writing styles for judgements, orders and statements, (vi) develop and execute a formal and practical plan for the improvement of the case tracking system (as suggested in the 'ACSP Improvement Plan' and other IT systems, (vii) revise and lay down the functioning of the 'Censor Division', (viii) enhance the knowledge of the Court's IT officers, and (ix) provide continuity and high standard for case officials' seminars and training programmes. To assess improvement in the overall court performance and its case flow management, the proposals for an 'Administrative Court Performance Measurement Scheme' (developed from the Trial Court Performance Standard) and an 'Administrative Court Case Flow Management Improvement Project' are developed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of information systems in the Jordanian banking sector  : a study of the acceptance of the internet</field><field name="creator">Al-Sukkar, Ahmad Saleh</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the findings of a study into issues concerning the acceptance of Internet Banking in Jordan, a country of the Middle East. Although conducted at a particular site on a particular IT application, there is justification for claiming that the findings are relevant to the introduction of the broad spectrum of Internet applications into other countries of the region and into developing countries in general. Thus the study makes significant contributions across all areas of IT adoption and usage research and practice as well as informing the banking sector in Jordan. The research began with an exploratory study involving some preliminary interviews with bank managers in Jordan and a review of some relevant literature. This led to the decision to base the study on the well-known Technology acceptance Model (TAM) with extensions to make it more relevant for a developing country such as Jordan whose environment is significantly different from that of the Western countries where the technology originated. To this end external variables were added to the model consisting of constructs under the heading of culture and trust from the consumer side and technology quality from the banking side. For the main study a mixed method approach was taken. An extensive empirical survey was undertaken to collect and analyse quantitative data from bank customers to test the expanded TAM. At the same time interviews were conducted with bank managers, IT people and academics in the field of social science. This qualitative data was processed using manual inspection and computer-based content analysis techniques to supplement the output of the quantitative study. The results of the quantitative and qualitative studies are discussed in terms of their academic contribution to the understanding of IT acceptance in developing countries and the development of additional constructs to TAM. There is also a major contribution to specific issues of technology acceptance in Jordan which may guide those responsible for decisions on the future economic and societal directions of the country.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an alternative program for teacher trainee mentoring: a case study at a Malaysian university</field><field name="creator">Ligadu, Christina P</field><field name="description">Mentoring practices have been an important part of the practicum in initial teacher training. The purpose of this study was to develop and investigate the impact of an integrated, culturally appropriate mentoring program for teacher mentors and mentees at two secondary schools in the state of Sabah, Malaysia. It also explored the institutional, cultural and pedagogic factors that influenced the impact of the mentoring program. Nine mentees and twelve teacher mentors participated in the study. A qualitative, case study method was utilized to investigate the impact of the mentoring program and factors that influenced that impact. Combined data sources from semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and document review were used to gather data on mentoring experiences in the study.The results indicate that the impact of the program was varied but generally positive for both mentees and mentors, professionally and personally. Both mentees and mentors gained from different aspects of mentoring support advocated in the mentoring program. Institutional, cultural and pedagogic factors that impacted on the mentoring program were identified as classroom practices support, peer mentoring, mentoring relationships and interpersonal communications, personal qualities and attitudes of participants, reflective practices and teaching observations. Major constraints identified were availability of mentors, particularly, and mentees, time and timing, and personal qualities and communication skills of both mentors and mentees. Cultural factors also seemed to have influenced the mentoring process.The study overall provides insights and guidelines for modifications in a revised mentoring program and recommendations for SESD, UMS, schools, higher education institutions, and education policy makers, and for further research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrative view and empirical examination of the relationships among knowledge management enablers, processes, and organizational performance in Australian enterprises</field><field name="creator">Migdadi, Mahmoud Mohammad</field><field name="description">This study briefly describes the main concepts of knowledge management enablers with a focus on transformational leadership constructs, knowledge processes with a focus on knowledge creation process (SECI of Nonaka and Takeuchi (199) model), organisational creativity, and organisational performance. There is a limited understanding of what determines effective knowledge management, and there is currently very limited tested framework that unifies all of the relevant abovementioned concepts in a relatively easy to understand and practical way. As such, one of the principal goals of this study is to develop an integrated framework, which can explain and guide the successful and effective management of knowledge in organisations. Such a framework should benefit the academic research in knowledge management as well as help managers in their efforts to best locate an organisational resource and focus its knowledge management efforts for optimum organisational performance. There are three main aims, which motivate the study. The first aim is to combine knowledge management enablers and knowledge creation processes from both a social perspective and a technological perspective in relation to organisational performance, and test the relationships empirically to provide strategic positions to organisations and provide them with indicators, which should help them to manage their knowledge effectively. Managers face a dilemma in selecting the most effective knowledge management enablers and knowledge management processes to solve organisational problems. In recent times, much has been written and many theories have been offered regarding the phenomenon of knowledge management and its implementation. However, little empirical research has been conducted to support these theories (Leech and Sutton, 2002), as the majority of studies reported in the literature come from single cases to small sample sizes where the generality of the results is significantly reduced (Gold, 2001). Current empirical research has explored the relationships between these factors in isolation. Rigorous development of a model of the salient issues is warranted, especially if it leads to a means of measurement of relevant constructs. Thus, the second aim of this study is to test the research integrative framework empirically. An exploratory study is undertaken to build the survey (instrument) of the constructs followed by a confirmatory analysis. The third aim of this study is to conduct a qualitative study (Q Method) on the main part of the study model, that is, transformational leadership constructs, in an attempt to investigate rigorously their contributions to the knowledge management effectiveness and their role in providing organisations with strategic positions. There are several theoretical and practical contributions for this study. This study makes significant contributions across multiple areas of knowledge management research. These contributions relate to (1) the development of a conceptual model that explains and predicts the effects of knowledge management enablers on knowledge creation process, which in turn affects organisational performance through organisational creativity; (2) the empirical support for the proposed hypotheses drawn from the literature review and based on the study integrative framework; (3) the development of a new instrument; (4) the research focuses on certain knowledge management enablers as the most important factors affecting the knowledge creation process; (5) the importance of the study, as most of the participants are Australian SMEs; (6) this study combines an exploratory approach followed by an empirical with confirmatory analysis in a rigorous and thorough methodology for knowledge management. The research results help managers establish strategic positions to manage knowledge effectively. Australian organisations may benefit from building a knowledge conductive culture, that is, a culture supportive of knowledge management which highly values knowledge and encourages its creation, sharing and application. Knowledge creation is associated with cultural factors (trust, collaboration and learning) included in this study. For example, group members are most creative when their members collaborate; members stop holding back when they have mutual trust (Huemer et al. 1998). Moreover, organisational learning is imperative and managers should continuously pay careful attention to it and make sure it is effective. Therefore, shaping cultural factors is crucial for a firm&#65533;s ability to manage its knowledge effectively (Chase, 1997; Davenport et al., 1998; Gold et al., 2001; Long, 1997). Organisations should have an environment that encourages forming t-shaped skills and should provide a systematic management of these skills. Role model leaders who practice transformational leadership in organisations can create an atmosphere of trust where knowledge and opinions can be shared openly without fear of punishment, risk taking is praised and courteous challenges to the status quo are welcomed, and there are opportunities to rethink assumptions and learn collectively from reflection (Baker and Camarata (1998). Strategy, goals and concepts associated with knowledge creation and transfer must be clear to every one in the organisation. Skyrme and Amidon (1997) assert that a compelling vision and conceptual architecture build a common language and define key domains for knowledge. Such domains create knowledge structures, often based on the individual pattern of use of concepts (Davenport and Prusak 1998, p. 159). IT is critical for codifying explicit knowledge since it provides fast feedback for explicit knowledge (Krogh et al., 2001; Weiser and Morrison, 1998). This study indicates that without a solid foundation of trust, the communication of even explicit knowledge is difficult (Scott, 2000). This implies that simply improving the IT infrastructure does not provide a competitive advantage for knowledge combination. Consequently, managers should pay careful attention to the potential impact of IT on knowledge combination with the consideration of trust in a firm. According to Maula (2000, p. 57): It is vital for management to recognise that organisational creativity is a subtle issue that depends on the firm&#65533;s tacit capabilities and characteristics. It also depends on an atmosphere that tolerates and favours intuition and inspiration, on the functioning of the relevant knowledge processes, on the availability of information and communication tools to help share knowledge in less-structured form, and to transform it into highly-structured form if necessary Organisations could benefit tremendously from the balance between imposing discipline of efficiency and delegating authority to encourage flexibility. Finally, this study has identified opportunities for further study that may significantly progress the continually evolving understanding of knowledge management, which can help formulate robust strategies that involve trade-offs between knowledge management enablers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coupled analysis of two-phase flow in rough rock fractures</field><field name="creator">Price, Jeffrey Richard</field><field name="description">This research project has considered the impact of roughness on two-phase (air + water) flow in rough discontinuous geological media. Existing analytical approaches to twophase flow tend to be highly theoretical and involve significant idealisation of the rock mass properties because of the variable distribution of rock mass discontinuities and the impact of fracture roughness. The anisotropic nature of fracture orientation, aperture topology and persistence combine to limit the coupled analysis of single and two-phase flow. The research has been driven by the need for improvements in the prediction of two-phase flows in the vicinity of underground mining development and infrastructure. The aim of the work has been to develop and verify robust simplified two-phase flow models that can be accurately applied to improve hydromechanical rock mass analysis. Isothermal two-phase flow behaviour is encountered in geotechnical engineering particularly in underground construction and extraction associated in coal mining or in developments near to coal measures geological environment. The hazards presented by the potential for outburst can lead to loss of life as well as loss of production. The financial consequences of the loss of just a day of production from a typical Australian longwall mine in 2002 would lie within the range of 7000 to 20,000 tonnes (approximately A$ 0.25 to 0.5 million). The development of a simple coupled twophase flow model would facilitate the ready quantification of geomechanical risks facing the industry. A detailed review of the literature on two-phase hydraulics and fracture roughness has identified opportunities for the development of new analytical techniques. Refined laboratory testing methods have been combined to gather high resolution roughness and aperture data. The resulting data have been used to study the nature of fracture roughness using Fourier series. Specialised two-phase triaxial testing has been conducted and the test results have been analysed using the detailed knowledge of the fracture roughness and aperture to study the role of free fracture flow. The findings of the theoretical and laboratory testing schedule have identified the opportunity to characterise fracture roughness and to relate the results of the testing to hydraulic and mechanical apertures. The study has developed a new technique to assess the frequency composition of fracture roughness that can be related to the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC). Laboratory testing has also validated a proposed coupled annular two-phase flow model that is based upon the conservation of mass. The model relates the phase height parameters to the fracture mechanical aperture and enables the calculation of phase flow rates. Consideration of hydromechanical analysis has lead to the development of a coupled homogenous fluid model that has highlighted the applicability of some of the study results to improve computer modelling capability using the existing UDEC code. Finite difference analysis has illustrated the development of non-parallel fracture flow and related the discretised mechanical aperture to the fracture hydraulic aperture. The homogenous fluid model has been found to enable hydromechanical analysis of rough fractures without the need for prior knowledge of the fracture JRC. These breakthroughs have revealed the potential for further application to field testing environments and improved hydromechanical modelling. Such an application of the study outcomes could increase the hydromechanical data that could be collected from borehole site investigation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multichannel blind deconvolution</field><field name="creator">Ma, Liang Suo</field><field name="description">This thesis studies some issues in the multichannel blind deconvolution (MBD) problem. MBD studies the problem of recovering the original latent source signals from a set of observation data, which is the convolutive mixture of the latent sources and an unknown dynamical system. Assumptions are usually adopted in deriving MBD algorithms to simplify the problem. Common assumptions include: the dynamical system is assumed to be linear and time invariant; the latent sources are assumed to contain at most one Gaussian distributed signal; the latent sources are statistically independent. There are, however, a number of additional assumptions introduced because a particular approach is followed. In our case, we follow the state space approach in representing the unknown dynamical system. This introduces a number of additional assumptions: (I) the mixing environment is assumed to be noise free; (II) the number of sources is assumed to be known; (III) the number of sources is assumed to be equal to the number of sensor measurements; (IV) the number of the states of the mixer is assumed to be known; (V) the latent sources are assumed to be super-Gaussian distributed. Assumption (IV) is specific to the state space approach, while the other assumptions also occur in other approaches. Obviously, the above assumptions are not necessarily true in practice. Our main aim in this thesis is to relax these assumptions so that the unknown dynamical system will be more accurately modelled and the MBD algorithms will be more suitable for practical applications. We propose to relax these five assumptions, one by one, through a number of novel algorithms. Balanced parametrization of linear time invariant systems originates in the field of system identification, system reduction and H1 control. Using a balanced canonical realization of the linear time invariant system, we will derive three versions of a balanced MBD algorithm in discrete time domain, continuous time domain, and unified discrete time and continuous time domains respectively. All these three versions of balanced algorithms can estimate the number of states in the mixer by considering the identified singular values in the balanced parametrization, thus relaxing assumption (IV). It is relatively easy to extend this formulation to include situations when the number of sensor measurements is greater than the number of latent sources, thus relaxing assumption (III) partially. The more difficult situation when the number of sensor measurements is less than the number of latent sources is not considered in this thesis. Most parameter estimation algorithms for the MBD problem include a nonlinear activation function in the algorithm. Dependent on the approach used in the derivation of the parameter estimation algorithm, the nonlinearity can take various forms, e.g., hyperbolic tangent function. However, normally in the derivation, it is implicitly assumed that the latent sources are super- Gaussian distributed, thus the hyperbolic tangent function is implicitly used as the nonlinearity. Unfortunately, in practice, it is seldom known in advance that the latent sources are super-Gaussian distributed. We will investigate a number of flexible source models, which will allow to separate both super-Gaussian and sub-Gaussian distributed sources. Through our empirical studies, we conjecture that the recovery of the latent sources is relatively insensitive to the probability distribution of the source signals, as long as some common nonlinearity is used in the parameter estimation algorithm in the MBD problem. We have empirically verified this conjecture for a set of commonly used nonlinear functions. Hence, assumption (V) is relaxed to an extent that the nonlinearity can be designed to be adaptive, according to the mixture of probability distribution of the latent sources, provided that the latent sources stay either super-Gaussian or sub-Gaussian for sufficiently long for the parameter estimation algorithm to converge sufficiently. The number of sources estimation problem can be formulated as a model comparison problem, which may be solved by evaluating marginal likelihood. However, it usually involves the evaluation of multiple variable integral expressions, which is well known to be difficult to evaluate computationally. Following a variational Bayesian (VB) approach, we overcome this difficulty in MBD problem by deriving a VB MBD algorithm, which has the following features: first, it allows to enclose noises in the system model; secondly, it allows to employ model comparison and automatic relevance determination to estimate the number of sources. Hence assumptions (I) and (II) are relaxed using this approach. This approach is applied to the estimation of the number of sources in artificially mixed speech signals, and then to electroencephalograph signals, the number of sources of which is not known a priori.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology revision on the semantic web: integration of belief revision theory</field><field name="creator">Kang, Seung Hwan</field><field name="description">The vision of the Semantic Web is to enable content of web resources to be interpreted and processed by software agents. Ontology provides a means to share and reuse data associated with web resources in a manner that can be autonomously performed by software agents. In the context of knowledge representation, ontology represents the abstract world of web resources in the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web will comprise of small, simple ontologies constructed by individual users. It is unlikely that ontology will be built from scratch each time. On the other hand, it is more likely that ontology will be adopted and modified from existing ontology. Why is ontology revision important? Very often, ontology exists in a particular period of timeline is designed based on the purpose of a specific domain of interest at that instance of time. Over time, ontology needs to be revised due to changes in domain, content, requirements, or structural representation. In this regard, ontology is the beliefs that the agents need to reference to in order to perform task in an autonomous way. As ontology evolves, beliefs in agents also evolve and knowledge gained by agents must be reflected in the ontology. This research investigates issues of ontology revision from the theoretical foundation of the belief revision theory. The AGM model of the coherence theory in belief revision is of particular relevant in this research. The AGM model uses three operations of expansion, contraction and revision in conjunction with the concept of epistemic entrenchment to revise the belief set. This research develops an ontology revision framework to manage the ontology revision process. The research will also illustrate a vision in which the practicability of this approach can be applied in e-commerce.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young women's meanings of health and physical activity: the body, schooling, and the discursive constitution of gendered and classed subjectivities</field><field name="creator">O'Flynn, Gabrielle Holly</field><field name="description">This thesis examines, from a Foucauldian perspective, the complex ways fourteen young women managed their subject positions and subjectivities in relation to health and physical activity discourses. It also explores how the young womens different school contexts impacted on this process. Foucauldian, post-structural conceptualisations of the self, as constituted through power/knowledge relations, and, in particular, Foucaults analytics of the technologies of the self, provided a useful tool for examining the complex ways the young women were actively involved in their own self-formation. Epidemiological research, and other physical activity participation literature, predominately characterise young womens physical activity participation in terms of individual choice and in terms of their lack of participation. This thesis attempts to challenge these characterisations by developing an understanding of the discursive and material resources available for the young women to construct the place and meaning of health and physical activity in their lives. A particular focus is placed on examining the influence of the young womens school contexts on this process. This thesis also extends critical health and physical activity literature by providing an understanding of the complex ways young women are involved in their self-constitution, and an understanding of the complex ways different young women engage with particular discursive regimes of health, physical activity, and femininity. The study reported in this thesis primarily draws on semi-structured interviews collected as a part of a longitudinal, qualitative research project. The fourteen young women were involved in the study for two years, during which they participated in approximately eight to ten interviews. The young women were initially recruited through two different schools, Bloomsbury Girls Private School: a prestigious, religious, girls school located in the metropolitan area of an Australian city, and Sunnydale High School: a co-education, government school, located in the outer suburbs of the same Australian city. An analysis of the schools websites and their physical and health education and school sport policies was conducted to gain an understanding of the discursive and material resources made available to the young women through their schooling. An analysis of the young womens interviews indicated that their meanings of health and physical activity were regulated by the intersections of dominant health, physical activity, and femininity discourses. These discourses were informative of the ways the young women engaged with their bodies and selves, and emphasised an engagement with the self based on self-monitoring and self-altering practices in relation to a normalised, slim, toned, healthy body. In terms of the young womens physical activity participation, traditional notions of femininity shaped and influenced the young womens choices to participate in particular physical activities and their embodied engagements in physical activity participation. Whilst dominant notions of femininity, health, and physical activity provided a pervasive resource on which the young women drew to constitute their subjectivities, there was diversity in the ways they engaged with these discourses. The specificity of the young womens lives, and their own engagement with the discourses, influenced how health and femininity discourses were manifested in their daily lives and constitution of selves. Finally, the results of this study highlighted the ways the young womens schools made available a particular set of cultural resources around health and physical activity, which were implicated in the production of particular gendered and classed subjectivities. The schools thus made available particular meanings of health and physical activity that had constitutive effects, and in particular, provided possibilities for the young women to think about their health and physical activity participation, and to regulate their lives and futures in gender and class specific ways. This study thus points to the need for physical and health educators to recognise, and reflect on, how they are implicated in reproducing both classed and gendered subjectivities, and dominant health, physical activity, and femininity discourses. Both of which hold consequences for shaping the ways young women (and, it could be argued, young men) think about their bodies, selves, futures, and importantly, their lives.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maze to care: the process of pathway to initial care of young adults aged 18-25 with their first presentation of a mental disorder</field><field name="creator">Webster, Sayumporn</field><field name="description">This study explores the lived experiences of a group of young people prior to coming into contact with mental health services for the first time. It asked, what was the pathway like for these young people, what happened to them and how did they experience and interpret that, and what was the extent and nature of delays in accessing care? The study uses the grounded theory method and encompasses Glaser and Strauss (1967) constant comparative method in the uncovering of the grounded theory, Strauss and Corbins (1990) work in the analysis, and Glasers (1978) work on theoretical sensitivity to guide data collection and analysis. Grounded theory focuses on how people view their experiences, how they interact and how these processes change (Wilson and Hutchinson 1996), and hence is an appropriate way to investigate the phenomenon. The purposive sampling consists of eight males and twelve females whose ages ranged from 18 to 23, from one Sydney Area Health Service. Twenty three semi-structure interviews were conducted over a fifteen months period. Analysis was undertaken concurrently, and the computer software application NVivo was used to manage the data. Finding a way represents the core category and is the basic social process by which young people experience the pathway to care. Finding a way can be conceptualised as a four-stage process. The stages which emerged from the data included a) first sign in the early stages of the illness, often greeted with denial and incomprehension, and self medication with alcohol and other drugs; b) recognition of the symptoms as a sign of mental illness, indicating that one needs help; c) understanding, discovering information about the illness and its impact on themselves and others; and d) resolution. At this point, effective care is successfully and, for most, voluntarily accessed. People progress through each process at different rates and for some, the journey to resolution may be short-circuited in earlier stages by particular incidents or exacerbations of their illness, leading to involuntary commitment to involuntary care. A fifth category, barriers and facilitating factors, refers to those processes and factors which impede or speed the progress to care and which can occur at any stage of the process. A model, called the Maze to Care, was developed from the findings. Unlike others, this model focuses on the pre-care rather than the post-care environment and reflects the perspective of the consumer. It can be used to direct attention to social and systems interventions which would enhance the capacity of young people and their families to recognise the symptoms of mental illness and access appropriate care.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge management styles and performance: a knowledge space model from both theoretical and empirical perspectives</field><field name="creator">Al-Hawari, Maen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes post-positivist research in the field of information systems, more specifically, in knowledge management. For company managers, deploying large-scale information systems such as knowledge management systems, the selection of an appropriate style for knowledge management initiatives are recognised as a dilemma. The study aims at helping to improve information systems applications for knowledge management in complex, technology-oriented organisations. The research addresses this dilemma by studying the relationships between organisational performance, knowledge availability, knowledge codification, knowledge application and knowledge management styles. From an extensive study of the literature, an innovative knowledge space (K-space) model of organisational knowledge is developed as the first stage of the research. This leads to the identification of four knowledge management styles and a framework that relates these styles to knowledge creation and improved organisational performance. The K-space model is adapted from the I-space framework (Boisot, 1995, 1998) with its three dimensions of diffusion, codification and abstraction, to bring into play three corresponding knowledge dimensions of availability, codification and application. Knowledge is viewed as an object in K-space so that knowledge processes are forces that act to move the knowledge objects within the three dimensions of K-space. The four traditional knowledge conversion processes of Nonaka and Takeuchi, (1995) socialisation, combination, internalisation and externalisation (SECI), map onto twodimensional planes in K-space. Taking advantage of the three dimensions of K-space, four new dynamic knowledge conversion process are identified, namely Adoption, Standardisation, Systemisation and Articulation. These are used to define the four knowledge management styles. The research framework suggest that knowledge creation, in term of knowledge availability and codifiability, mediates the relationship between the four knowledge management styles and organisational performance. In addition knowledge application moderates the relationship between these knowledge creation processes. A set of hypotheses is generated from the framework and a survey instrument constructed to empirically test the hypotheses. A pilot study involving 45 managers was used to check the reliability and validity of the constructs in the questionnaire. The resulting questionnaire was mailed to 338 organisations around Australia in different industries. Confirmatory analyses were used to check the constructs and multiple linear regression, simple linear regression and MANOVA analysis were used to test the set of the hypotheses. The results confirm that an organisation can improve its performance through better management of its knowledge capabilities. There is a particular benefit of deploying a balance of knowledge management styles combining the human and technology perspectives. Knowledge management styles are shown to contribute positively to both knowledge codification and availability. Knowledge applicability is confirmed as a moderator factor between knowledge availability, as well as knowledge codification, and organisational performance. Using a MANOVA analysis, the four knowledge management styles are found to be deployed in significantly different ways by organisations in different industry types. The findings demonstrate that the K-space model provides the basis for a new way of conceptualising knowledge creation processes within organisations. They underline the importance of continuing research that adds to the understanding of knowledge management capabilities in an organisation. Therefore, this study makes a significant contribution to a burgeoning topic that is of increasing importance to both the academic literature and the organisational practice of knowledge management.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predator-prey interactions in the spinifex grasslands of central Australia</field><field name="creator">Paltridge, Rachel M</field><field name="description">Predation by exotic predators (cats Felis catus and foxes Vulpes vulpes) is believed to be one of the factors that has contributed to the decline of medium-sized mammals in arid Australia. Other factors include habitat degradation by introduced herbivores (rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and grazing stock) and altered fire regimes after Aboriginal people moved into permanent settlements. In general, the impact of exotic predators on arid zone mammals is believed to be significant only when predator numbers have been elevated by increased food availability from exotic prey species (rabbits, house-mice Mus domesticus, cattle carcasses) or when native prey populations have already been dramatically reduced by competition from introduced herbivores. In much of the spinifex grasslands of the central Australian deserts, pastoralism never occurred, rabbit colonisation was extremely patchy and in some areas, traditional burning was still being practised when the extinctions commenced. None of the current models of mammalian extinctions adequately explain the declines in this environment. In this study I examined predator-prey interactions in two areas of the Tanami Desert to investigate whether predation by exotic predators may be a primary agent of extinction in its own right, capable of causing mass declines even in the absence of other human-induced perturbations. If this were the case then the following would be expected: (i) cats and foxes would eat medium-sized mammals when they are available, but be able to survive on alternative prey when mammals are scarce; (ii) populations of cats and foxes would be buffered against the declines of mammals during droughts, or would be able to recover more quickly than medium-sized mammals after droughts; (iii) medium-sized mammals would be more vulnerable to predation by cats and foxes than by dingoes Canis lupus dingo and other native predators, and (iv) there would be a correlation between the timings of the extinctions and the colonisation (or sudden increase) of cats and foxes. These predictions were investigated by monitoring the diets and relative abundance of cats, foxes and dingoes in relation to fluctuating prey availability in two areas of the Tanami Desert at latitudes separated by approximately 400 km. Mean annual rainfall is higher and more reliable in the northern study area which was situated in the centre of bilby Macrotis lagotis distribution within the Northern Territory, whereas the southern study area was located on the southern edge of the bilby&#65533;s range. Within each study area, monitoring occurred at three sites, approximately 20 km apart. Each site contained a sub-plot in each of two habitat types. Field work was conducted between September 1995 and December 1997. When the study began, the southern study area was experiencing drought conditions, however both study areas received significant rainfall in early 1997. The population dynamics of a variety of potential prey groups were monitored to examine their resilience during droughts, patterns of recolonisation after rainfall, and use of two habitat types: the ubiquitous sandplain, and the moister, nutrient enriched palaeodrainage habitat which is believed to have provided a refuge for medium-sized mammals during droughts. Native mammals were uncommon throughout the study period. Bilbies and macropods were significantly more abundant in the northern study area, and tended to occur more frequently in palaeodrainage habitat than sandplain. However, the palaeodrainage habitat did not appear to provide adequate refuge for the medium and large mammals during drought conditions in the southern study area, as they disappeared from the study sites altogether. Small mammals were significantly more abundant in the southern study area but densities remained low (less than 2% trap success) throughout the study, and showed little response to improved seasonal conditions. In contrast, the abundance and species richness of birds showed a marked increase following rainfall in the southern study area. Flocks of nomadic birds arrived within several months of drought-breaking rains, increasing the relative abundance of birds from 9.3 per km of transect in December 1996 to 49/km in July 1997. Reptiles were the most resilient prey group during the drought conditions. Both varanids and smaller reptiles were equally abundant in the wet and dry years and showed no difference in abundance between study areas. However, reptiles showed marked temperature-related patterns in activity, with many species becoming inactive in the winter months. A total of 142 cat scats, 126 fox scats and 75 dingo scats were analysed to investigate predator diets in the two study areas. Unlike cat, fox and dingo diets elsewhere in Australia (and the world), mammalian prey did not dominate. Reptile was the prey category that was most frequently consumed by cats and foxes in &#65533;summer&#65533; (October-April) and by dingoes throughout the year, and was identified as a &#65533;seasonal staple&#65533; prey type for all three predators in the Tanami Desert. When biomass of prey was taken into account, the varanids (predominantly the sand goanna Varanus gouldii) were the most important prey sustaining predators in the two study areas. Birds were an important part of the diets of cats and foxes in winter when reptiles were less active. Small mammals were consumed by cats and foxes throughout the study, in proportion to their field abundances. Invertebrates were a major component of the diets of foxes, representing 31% of prey items consumed. There was considerable overlap in the diets of the three predator species, but dingoes ate more medium (100-999 g) and large (greater than 1000 g) prey than cats and foxes did. The scarcity of medium-sized mammals in the study areas provided little opportunity to find evidence of predation events on such prey. However, bilby remains were found in two cat scats and one dingo scat in the northern study area, mulgara Dasycercus cristicauda remains occurred in several cat and fox scats from the southern study area, and there were fourteen occurrences of marsupial mole Notoryctes typhlops in predator scats during the study, primarily in fox scats. Elsewhere in Australia, there is ample evidence that cats and foxes regularly consume medium-sized mammalian prey (e.g. rabbits and ringtail possums Pseudocheirus peregrinus) when it is available. Overall cats were the most abundant eutherian predators in the two study areas, and they were significantly more abundant in the northern study area than the southern study area. Surveys revealed that cats can persist into droughts by feeding on reptilian prey. When the study commenced, cats occurred on five of the six sub-plots in the southern study area, despite six consecutive years of below-average rainfall. However, by the end of the first year, they could only be detected on one sub-plot. Recolonisation of the sites rapidly occurred after significant rainfall (260 mm in 2 months), when nomadic birds colonised the sites and provided a plentiful food source. Foxes also declined to very low densities during drought in the southern study area, but they had recolonised all sites by the winter of 1997. This coincided with the increase in abundance of birds, which became their most frequently consumed prey item. Overall, foxes were equally abundant in the two study areas, but statistical analyses revealed a significant interaction between latitude and habitat because in the southern study area foxes tended to utilise the palaeodrainage habitat more than the sandplain, whereas in the northern study area the majority of fox sign was detected in the sandplain habitat. This may have been due to the abundance of dingoes in the palaeodrainage habitat in the northern study area. Dingoes were significantly more abundant in the northern study area than the southern, where they were usually only present at one of the three sites. The northern study area had higher densities of macropods (supplementary prey for dingoes) and more reliable access to drinking water, which persisted in the palaeodrainage channels for up to 6 months after significant rain events. Dingo numbers were relatively stable throughout the study and did not increase in response to improved seasonal conditions in the southern study area in 1997. This study revealed that the distribution of foxes extends further north into the Tanami Desert than has previously been reported, and is not necessarily tied to the distribution of rabbits in the Northern Territory. Furthermore, discussion with Aboriginal people who lived a traditional lifestyle in the area until the 1940s, revealed that foxes were already present in the northern Tanami desert at that time, before the disappearance of many medium-sized mammal species. The patterns of medium-sized mammalian extinctions in the northern and western deserts between 1940 and 1960 is thus consistent with the colonisation of the fox. Although cats had been present in central Australia for at least 50 years before the mammalian declines occurred, this does not discount them from contributing to the extinction process. It is postulated that during the early decades of their colonisation of the arid interior, cat populations may have been maintained at low levels by predation from dingoes and also Aboriginal people (for whom cats were a favoured food). But between 1920 and 1960 the western deserts were depopulated of Aboriginal people, and human hunting of cats diminished. This coincided with the introduction of the dingo bounty scheme, which encouraged many Aboriginal people to continue making regular excursions into the deserts to collect dingo scalps. In this study, cat remains occurred in 9% of dingo scats, suggesting that dingoes may be an important predator of cats. Thus, there may have been an increase in the cat population between 1930 and 1960, producing a more significant impact on native mammal populations than had previously occurred. Information collected during this study was used to construct a new model of mammalian extinctions in the spinifex grasslands of central Australia that promotes predation by cats and foxes as the primary agent of extinction. The model proposes that cats and foxes will eat medium-sized mammals when they are available, but are capable of subsisting on naturally occurring alternative prey when mammals are scarce. Thus, cats and foxes can persist into drought periods by feeding on reptilian prey, which remains an abundant resource regardless of rainfall (at least during the warmer months). Predator populations eventually decline after a series of dry winters. When the drought breaks, the rapid response of nomadic birds provides a readily available food source for cats and foxes as they recolonise areas and commence breeding. Predation by cats and foxes thereby has the potential to exacerbate the declines of native prey populations during droughts and delay their recovery when seasonal conditions improve. In this way, introduced predators are capable of causing local extinctions of medium-sized mammals when populations contract during drought periods, even in the absence of introduced herbivores and altered fire regimes. Although dingoes also prey upon medium-sized mammals, dingoes did not cause extinctions of medium-sized mammals in the spinifex grasslands because (i) they are more reliant on drinking water than foxes and cats, thus waterless areas would have provided some degree of predation refugia, and (ii) their social structure and territoriality prevent high densities accumulating, even when resources are abundant. If further extinctions of medium-sized mammals (such as the bilby) are to be prevented, it may be necessary for wildlife managers to establish a series of predation refugia where fox and cat populations can be controlled without extinguishing local dingo populations. This could be achieved with a combination of predator-proof enclosures, zones in which foxes are killed through poison baiting and areas where Aboriginal people are employed to utilise traditional hunting methods to control introduced predators.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sarah Dawes and the coal lumpers: absence and presence on the Sydney waterfront 1900-1917</field><field name="creator">Beasley, Margo</field><field name="description">This thesis is, primarily, a feminist account of meaning and significance in working class households on the early twentieth century Sydney waterfront. Initially, the raison detre of the thesis was to redress the patent absence of women and their domestic labour in my earlier work on the history of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia (WWF). However, in response to feminist epistemological arguments - about forces that determine historical absence and presence, and the symbolic nature of concepts of masculinity and femininity - the concerns of the thesis broadened. It now encompasses all members of waterfront households - men and children as well as women - and it also examines, to a lesser degree, hitherto neglected aspects of the history of mens waterfront work. A central proposition of the thesis is that history that awards significance from the perspective of public life (as histories of trade unions do) necessarily privileges masculine relationships (actual or symbolic). Such history generates presence and absence along lines that are often gendered. By contrast, history that seeks meaning and significance from the perspective of the household can scrutinise women, children and men with relative equality. Through this route the interactive and entwined experiences of gender, class and generations can be made more visible, and alternative accounts of meaning and significance can emerge. The thesis utilises a range of documentary and oral sources to support this proposition, but it also employs inference and deduction to argue its case. Through this method it draws attention to the contrast between the kinds of meaning and significance that emerge from a study of day-to-day life, and the meaning and significance that external constructs award. The subject matter of the thesis is organised into three areas: historical absence and presence; practical aspects of the day-to-day life of the household; and work of all kinds. The thesis demonstrates that processes affecting historical absence and presence occur for contemporary as well as historic reasons, and apply to men as well as to women. Biases in socially constructed records, which are blind to many women&#65533;s activities and disregard their domination of particular categories, allow the early twentieth century Sydney waterfront to be characterised as a masculine place. However, the same records reveal the widespread existence of categories of male waterfront work that challenge the wharf labourers contemporary hold on waterfront labour history. Household finances, housing and fertility highlight differences between lived life on the Sydney waterfront and ideological, and gendered, constructs that purport to account for women and mens behaviour. The breadwinner/dependent spouse dichotomy is demonstrably false for early twentieth century waterfront households; gendered use of waterfront housing did not accord with the ideology of its architecture; and atypically high fertility amongst waterfront women of the period contradicts both feminist and economistic arguments about the meaning of fertility limitation. Work of all kinds provides a lens for viewing the spousal, parental and filial relationships of the waterfront household. The economic purpose of some womens home-based work is demonstrably similar to men&#65533;s waged work, and aspects of their domestic work challenges notions of male power within the working class household. However, the meaning and significance of unpaid domestic work for the women who did it remains relatively obscure. Waterfront childrens paid and unpaid work was prompted by filial obligations to the household that entailed a lengthening of childhood, which contrasts with economistic constructions that perceive childhood in terms of the school/work divide. When the spectrum of men&#65533;s paid and unpaid work and work-based activity is analysed it bears a marked similarity to the pattern of waterfront womens work. Because waterfront men can be argued to have put the private relationships of the home ahead of their relationships with other men the meaning of their work is arguably similar to the meaning of womens work. The thesis concludes that when the private life of household is scrutinised an alternative account emerges that challenges the meaning and significance implied by historical accounts of public life. Women and men can be understood less as symbolic constructions than as real people for whom meaning and significance were similar. In this the thesis offers a feminist alternative to the masculinist and economistic approaches of institutional history.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving coal mine safety by identifying factors that influence the sudden release of gases in outburst prone zones</field><field name="creator">Sereshki, Farhang</field><field name="description">In recent decades, the subject of coal and gas outburst in underground coal mines has been a focus of interest in Australia and worldwide. Much of this interest has been the result of the alarming increase in outburst related incidents and associated fatalities world wide, particularly in China, Russia, Ukraine and other major coal producing countries. Australia, on the other hand, has seen a relative decline in outburst related incidents, for the last three years no outburst related incident has been reported. Effective gas drainage programmes, better management of outburst prone zones, tougher regulations and a continuing programme of dedicated vigilance and research have collectively contributed to improvements in outburst prevention. Still, however, difficult problems remain to be addressed. Geological disturbances such as dykes, shear planes and increased mineralisation can influence coal permeability and porosity. These disturbances must be fully understood in order to develop an effective on gas drainage programme and reduce outburst risks. Accordingly, a programme of laboratory studies was undertaken to investigate the relationship between coal composition, coal volumetric change and coal permeability. Coal samples for this study were obtained from four different coalmines in Australia (Tahmoor, Metropolitan, Dartbrook and North Goonyella) and Tabas coalmine in Iran. Coal samples were tested in different types of gases and under different gas pressures and stress conditions. Coal permeability tests were conducted in the gas pressure chamber of the multi-function outburst research rig (MFORR), and the volumetric change tests were carried out in a modified pressure bomb. Microscopic studies provided a better correlation between coal composition permeability and shrinkage characteristics. A numerical model was developed to simulate single gas flow through a coal sample. The simulation further supported the experimental studies. The petrographical tests showed that most of the Australian coals tested were inertinite rich coals. The mineral matter in the Australian coal samples were mostly carbonate (calcite) and clay, but the Iranian Tabas coal had pyrite as the dominant mineral matter. Tabas coal has the highest vitrinite concentration (70%) and lowest proportion of inertinite elements (8.18%), the lowest vitrinite content was obtained from North Goonyella coal. There was a definite correlation between coal composition, coal volumetric change and coal permeability. Volumetric strain changes during the adsorption stage in all gas environments were greater than the volumetric strains in the desorption stage. The level of coal shrinkage was affected by the type of gas desorbed. Carbon dioxide appears to have the greatest influence on the matrix and nitrogen the least. The permeability of coal was also influenced by the gas type and pressure. Greater gas permeability was obtained in N2 gas, and the lowest permeability was obtained in a CO2 environment. The sorption characteristics of CO2 are a major factor. The degree of coal permeability is reduced exponentially by increasing the applied stress and also by increasing the confining gas pressure, irrespective of the gas type. The permeability tests showed that with an increased inertinite content the permeability of coal increased, except in the case of Tahmoor Colliery 900 Panel which showed a decrease. Comparison of the Tahmoor coals from 800 and 900 Panels showed that the permeability of coal was influenced by the mineral content and the carbonates, as well as the cavities. In particular; there was a reduction in coal permeability with increasing mineral content and carbonate content of the coal. With an increase in the percentage of inertinite, the permeability of coal increased. The numerical modelling provided an opportunity to quantify the flow mechanism in coal. It was possible to simulate the flow duration across the coal samples as a function of time with different gases and coal types. It was recommended that the study be extended to include more coal deposits and coals with different geological variations, so that an effective data bank can be established for Australian coals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speakin' out blak: an examination of finding an 'Urban' indigenous 'Voice' through contemporary Australian theatre</field><field name="creator">Blackmore, Ernie</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts a complex negotiation between critical and creative writing modes, articulated through the prism of Indigenous issues. As an urban Indigenous writer and critic, I have sought to provide a platform from which it may be possible both to chart a recognisable urban Indigenous *voice* and to see how it can be given shape through the medium of contemporary theatre. Critically the thesis examines the absence of an urban Indigenous voice within mainstream Australia and the reasons for its absence. It asks how the identity, legitimacy and supremacy of that voice can be accommodated. The creative works contained within the thesis are disparate in time, *voice* and setting, demographics: Positive Expectations is contemporary and urban, a more conventionally structured drama looking at issues about racial and sexual identity and questions of family. Waiting for Ships is a dramatic monologue that addresses more personal issues to do with the Stolen Generations and the politics of child removal. Both provide different takes on what an urban Indigenous voice can sound like and the messages it can speak. This thesis argues that there has always been a need for an *urban* Indigenous voice, but that that voice has largely been silenced by academe, industry, politics. As a result, urban Aboriginal people may well experience a redoubled sense of cultural loss because of this effective denial of their identity. This thesis seeks to provide a platform for this Indigenous voice to be heard. Finally, this thesis argues for the connection between the theatre and the public and the need for theatre to be both a platform for didactic performance and the vehicle to engage readers and audiences as essential participants in the process of reshaping views about the role of urban Aboriginal people in theatre, politics and nation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The principal's role in teacher professional learning</field><field name="creator">Ghaleei, Alireza</field><field name="description">Little attention has been paid to understanding the principal's role in teachers' professional learning. This study was conducted to investigate ways in which principals implement state-wide policy on teachers' professional learning at the school level in New South Wales (NSW) public schools. The major question in this study was: What is the principal's role in teacher professional learning and its relationship with the Professional Learning Policy? Three sub questions framed the study were: Firstly, how do principals implement the state-wide policy on teacher professional learning? Secondly, what kinds of capabilities do principals need for the implementation of the Professional Learning Policy at the school level? Thirdly, what constraints do principals face in the implementation of the Professional Learning Policy? The focus of the research was principals, teachers, and all members of the school Professional Learning Teams in three public primary schools, in the Wollongong area of NSW. Case study methodology was applied in investigating the principal's leadership and management approaches, policy requirements, and characteristics of teachers' professional learning. The research utilised a mixed quantitative and qualitative descriptive research design, employing the questionnaire as its primary data-gathering instrument, semi-structured interviews, and document review. An analysis of these data identified areas where the principals implemented Professional Learning Policy in the schools. The findings indicated that both the principals and teachers had welcomed the implementation of the state-wide Professional Learning Policy and even in the initial phases of implementing the policy gave considerable thought to planning and other management practices. The findings also indicate that collaboration between the principal and staff was essential for implementation of the policy. Clearly, the principal as leader of the school Professional Learning Team has the central role in leading and managing teachers' professional learning and the important functions of this role are planning; encouraging teachers to participate; implementation of programs; and evaluation of programs. This study indicates that there are interactive relationships among these roles and that the principal's attention to one role without concern for the others can result in unsuccessful and ineffective professional learning programs. The results of this study provide information on leadership and management practices in teachers' professional learning that can lead to better outcomes for teachers and ultimately the students they teach. Additionally, the author makes recommendations on policy implementation; principal's capabilities; constraints; and further research on teachers' professional learning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of manganese and chromium on the selective oxidation of low carbon strip steels for tinplate applications</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Paton Ron</field><field name="description">The &#8216;edge defect&#8217; is a band of low reflectivity that occurs near the edge of batch annealed steels that have been tinplated. The tinplate product that contains this defect must be scrapped because of the poor aesthetical properties and the reduced corrosion resistance in the affected areas. This defect was known to be caused by surface precipitates formed during batch annealing of the steel strip substrate. This research aims to identify the surface precipitates and the factors that can be modified to reduce their formation in an effort to develop an alloying and/or processing strategy which eliminates the occurrence of the &#8216;edge defect&#8217;.In this investigation the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which demonstrated that surface MnCr2O4 spinel precipitates were responsible for the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; although two different oxides, (MnFe)O and MnCr2O4 spinel, were observed on the steel surface. The formation of the surface (MnFe)O and MnCr2O4 spinel was due to the selective oxidation of manganese and chromium during batch annealing. The effects of manganese, chromium and annealing temperature on selective oxidation were also investigated and it was found that the MnCr2O4 spinel precipitate size and distribution were directly affected by the content of the chromium in the steels. The higher the chromium content of the steel the coarser the surface MnCr2O4 spinel particles. The annealing temperature has a similar effect on the average size of the MnCr2O4 spinel. Within the range of this investigation the higher the annealing temperature the coarser the surface particle size.The surface precipitates across the width of industrial batch annealed steel strip were characterised using SEM and TEM which established that the diameter of the surface oxide precipitates decreased from the edge to the centre of the steel strip. However, for the steel strip which exhibits the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; the maximum size of the surface precipitates does not occur at the edge, rather about 20-100 mm from the edge. This has been interpreted as the result of the transition of internal selective oxidation to external selective oxidation suggesting that the steel sheet&#8217;s exhibiting the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; are exposed to relatively higher oxygen potentials.This investigation has identified that lowering the annealing temperature, reducing the chromium level in the steel and reducing the oxygen potential of the annealing environment will reduce the formation of the MnCr2O4 spinel. Therefore the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; may be reduced by modifying these parameters during tinplate production. The minimisation of this defect will reduce production costs and improve product consistency for tinplate production.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of compositions and mechanical milling modes on hydrogen storage properties</field><field name="creator">Huang, Zhenguo</field><field name="description">The objectives of this work are to further enhance the hydrogen storage properties of some promising candidate materials and to investigate the impact of milling mode on the hydrogen storage properties. Mg1.9Cu0.1Nix (x = 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, and 2.1) alloys were synthesized using a high-energy Spex 8000 ball mill. The effects of nickel content on the thermal stability and on the hydrogenation of the alloys are discussed. It was found that the nickel content affects the recrystallization of the predominately amorphous alloys, and as a result, affects the formation of Mg2NiH4. The Mg1.9Cu0.1Nix (x = 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, and 2.1) alloys were also investigated with respect to the electrochemical performance. Ni was found to be effective in maintaining the reversibility and discharge capacity of the alloy electrodes. With the aim of improving the hydrogen cycling properties of magnesium, two types of catalysts were studied. In order to investigate the differences in the catalysis arising from the respective valence states of a transition metal in the oxides, two types of iron oxides, i.e. Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, were ball milled with Mg in hydrogen using the low-energy shearing mode of a Uni-Ball-Mill 5, as discussed below. The hydrogen cycling properties of the ball-milled composites were studied. There was little difference in the hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics of the two composites, which is presumably due to the reduction reaction occurring during hydrogen cycling. Three carbon allotropes with very different structure, i.e. graphite, carbon black, and multiwalled nanotubes, were also tried as catalysts. Although the graphitic structure experienced the most disruption, graphite showed a noticeable catalytic effect by improving the hydrogen absorption and desorption kinetics of Mg. The possible origins of the enhancement are probed. In order to investigate the effects of milling energy on the hydrogen storage properties, a special mill was used, the Uni-Ball-Mill 5, which allows the control of the movements of the grinding balls. Two milling modes, a high-energy impact mode and a low-energy shearing mode can be realized through the adjustment of the attached external magnet. Graphite, a very interesting material for hydrogen storage, was studied in particular. The influence of the different milling modes on the hydrogen absorption and storage capacity is discussed. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the composition of the milled graphite and the milling mode. As a result, different thermal behaviors were observed for the respective samples. Boron was milled in hydrogen using both low-energy shearing and high-energy impact. The amount of hydrogen trapped during milling is dependent on the milling mode. The thermal behaviors were also different for the respective samples.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity in systems and organisations: problems of new systems' implementation</field><field name="creator">Suratmethakul, Wannapa</field><field name="description">When an organisation is looking for a computer-based system to support part of their operation it is not uncommon for them to consider purchasing an application software that is already in use in an organisation similar to itself. Those responsible for the system's acquisition are considerably influenced by any advice they receive on experiences with the proposed new system from those who have successfully used the application. Such communication between organisations may only occur at management level so that actual end-users are rarely involved. Issues of system usability are therefore assumed to be unproblematic, as the system has been used in a comparable real world situation. Even less of a consideration is whether the context of use in the receiving organisation is similar to those where the system is currently being used so that systems implementation can take place with ease. The study presented in this thesis confirms the importance of critical contextual factors that affect the capability of people in an organisation and the performance of the whole organisation when a complex new system is implemented. It also demonstrates the relationships between contextual factors and the importance of these factors. The research has used a grounded theory approach to reveal details within complex phenomena in an organisation when a substantial new system was implemented. This approach has been shown to be eminently suitable for the study which involved a new timetabling system in an educational institution. Furthermore, Activity Theory was seen as an appropriate framework to display and interpret large amounts of inter-related data in a holistic and comprehendible way. The study revealed three critical issues: Knowledge Transfer, System Capability, and Organisational Context that appeared to be related to the problems of implementing the new information system in the organisation. These three issues are the main categories emerging from the data analysis leading into the effect of 'influencing capability and thereby organisational performance' which was designated as the core category. From a holistic view, the Activity Theory interpretation revealed that the dominant activities of the organisation in the case, teaching and learning were distorted by the new system as people in the organisation put more effort on getting the system to work rather than doing their own job. This research adds to the understanding of a common situation where management have an over simplified view of organisational work and assume that implementing a new computer based system can quite easily improve the performance of the organisation. However the nature and the processes of most work are more complicated than they realise so that it is rarely simple to implement a system to support a job that is inherently complex. Traditional organisations, which rely on a 'command and control' approach to management, do not handle complexity well thereby restricting the ability of staff to use their knowledge of the real conditions to adapt their work to suit changing organisational systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of structured food pattern advice for achievement of macronutrient targets in nutrition intervention</field><field name="creator">Gillen, Lynda Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Dietary advice to individuals in Medical Nutrition Therapy for the prevention and treatment of disease should be based on the best available evidence. A review of the evidence identifies appropriate nutrients on which to base advice. However, evidence to support the application of advice for the achievement of nutrient targets in free-living individuals has not been adequately determined. In this doctoral program the hypothesis tested was that structured advice based on the pattern of intake from food group sources of required nutrients will result in better achievement of dietary targets and thereby clinical outcomes than advice based on existing core food guides. In developing a more comprehensive food guidance system, nutritional therapy for diabetes treatment provides an appropriate example in which individual macronutrients and the type of fat are targets of advice. A cross-sectional survey of the food habits of a sample of women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus was conducted to confirm the relevance of food patterns to specific clinical outcomes, in this case, glucose tolerance. Secondly, foods commonly consumed by these women enabled the identification of food groups likely to impact on macronutrient and fat profiles within the diet. Subsequent determination of a total diet model demonstrated that a structured approach to dietary advice relating to nine food groups (vegetables, starch, fruit, milk, soymilk, meat, oily fish/soybeans, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) for the identification of sources of saturated and unsaturated fats would achieve nutritional adequacy and targets for energy and individual macronutrients with minimal variation. This then formed the basis of individualised advice in dietary intervention trials. Applying the newly developed advice system in an intervention trial demonstrated its feasibility in women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. Compared with a similar group receiving standardised low fat advice, 80% achieved saturated and polyunsaturated fat targets compared with nil in the standard intervention group, without detrimental changes to the overall macronutrient profile. The clinical effectiveness of the advice system was again demonstrated in a second trial. In this study men and women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus followed two alternative patterns of advice based on the newly developed food guidance system for six months. In these two groups respectively, 79% and 100% of subjects, achieved targeted proportions of total polyunsaturated fat compared to 25% in a control group (p(less than)0.05). In addition, greater improvements were achieved for HDL cholesterol (+18% and +21% compared to +13% control, p(less than)0.05) and triglyceride levels (-12% and -11% compared to -2% control). In summary, this thesis has outlined the development and evaluation of an advice system to support nutrition intervention in people with diabetes. Individualised advice based on a structured food pattern identifying food group sources of target nutrients was both feasible to implement and effective in practice. The application of this knowledge will help support nutrition intervention research as well as provide an evidence-based approach to Medical Nutrition Therapy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tainted fruit</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Pearlie</field><field name="description">I have written two earlier books about my family.

Counting the Rivers, is also chronological, but the story is written as a novel, using a fragmentary style rather than chapters. This structure includes pages of my patient file, and italicised paragraphs written from the point of view of the main character. This novel documents my experience as a psychiatric patient in Sydney, in the era of the 1960s and 70s. Tainted Fruit, a reflective book, is then, the third book of this trilogy and is not circumscribed by the defines or conventions of any one genre but instead, borrows from many genres: fiction, memoir, journals (etc) in order to create its own experimental, imaginative form.  I have sought to explore a broader range of options for my own narrating voice.I have sought to examine the implications of violence within my own family, the far-reaching implications of growing up with domestic violence as a backdrop to daily life and reverberations of awareness and shame. I am concerned too, about how that experience of childhood can continue a cycle of violence that for some is hard to resist.My research for both the book and the exegesis has involved a wide range of sources: books, newspapers, journals, magazines, maps, oral history recordings and transcripts, rent-book records, genealogical documents, interviews with members of my family, visits to relevant settings and website material: detailing information from writers&#8217; panels as well as interviews with individual writers. The exegesis chapters are organised around the narrating voice. My particular interest has been point of view. What power is invested in the narrator and where do they stand in relation to the events, the people, they are writing about?

Previous investigations concerning the biology and ecology of this species have been limited in this region, particularly for south-eastern Australia. Despite considerable public concern about the species, catches of T. australiensis are largely unregulated, at least partly because there has been virtually no data to support the development of appropriate management strategies. The present research was initiated to address the lack of baseline data on the fisheries biology, ecology and recreational harvesting of T. australiensis, to assist in providing a more sustainable approach to management and conservation. Preliminary studies comparing different quantitative sampling methods demonstrated that manual suction pumps (i.e., yabby pumps) were a more efficient and representative method of sampling T. australiensis than coring devices. Following the determination of a suitable sampling methodology, a hierarchical sampling program was established in south-eastern Australia to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of abundance, reproduction and growth. This involved sampling three estuaries spanning 300 km of coastline, namely Port Hacking, Shoalhaven River and Moruya River. The experimental design incorporated nested spatial scales ranging from hundreds of kilometres (between estuaries), kilometres (between sites), tens to hundreds of metres (between plots) and metres (between quadrats). Sampling was conducted over a two-year period, monthly for the first year and quarterly for the second. One site was sampled monthly for the entire study period to investigate differences between years. Overall, abundances were more variable on smaller spatial scales between sites within estuaries and between plots within sites. However, it was evident that these spatial patterns also changed through time. Increases in abundance across all sites during spring/summer periods, resulted in an increased patchiness in abundance within sandflats at a scale of tens to hundreds of metres (between plots), and less patchiness at the smallest spatial scales of metres (between replicates). This result suggested that increases in abundance might be explained by a redistribution of animals due to spawning aggregations, rather than nett increases in shrimp numbers. Furthermore, while recruitment occurred during spring and summer months, increases in numbers and biomass during these periods were greater than would be expected from recruitment alone. Increases in temperature and salinity may have initiated hypothesized breeding aggregations, although relationships between environmental variables and abundance were not significant even though general trends were evident. Timing of recruitment was consistent between years and included a latitudinal pattern of earlier recruitment in southern estuaries, which was probably related to earlier breeding periods at these locations. Despite this, the supply of new recruits was consistent over large geographic scales and patchy within and between sites within estuaries, suggesting distribution and survival of larvae may be influenced by local hydrology and environmental conditions. Stronger recruitment in consecutive years may have been related to prevailing drought conditions, enhancing survival of larvae due to consistently higher salinities resulting from reduced freshwater inputs. Relationships between number of burrows and abundance of T. australiensis were investigated, since burrow counts are often used to estimate densities of ghost shrimp. Some significant relationships were observed between number of burrows and abundance of T. australiensis. However, spatial and temporal inconsistencies indicated that counting of burrow openings was not always a reliable predictor of relative abundance. Estimates of the magnitude of populations suggested that standing stocks of T. australiensis at individual sites were in the order of millions of individuals. Sex ratios were significantly biased towards females following sexual maturity and this pattern was spatially and temporally consistent at all locations. Hypotheses explaining female-biased sex ratios remain speculative for T. australiensis and other thalassinids and further research is required. Despite consistencies related to female-biased sex ratios, there was considerable intraspecific variability in the reproductive biology of T. australiensis over different spatial and temporal scales. Female size at maturity, based on ovigerous females, was smaller for populations in southern estuaries. However, the specific roles of environmental and/or density-dependent factors such as population abundance, temperature and availability of food in determining these patterns are unclear. Similarly, these factors may also influence commencement of breeding seasons, which was asynchronous and occurred progressively earlier in southern populations. Unimodal breeding seasons generally lasted 5 to 6 months, with ovigerous females occurring from mid-summer through to autumn across most sites. Fecundity increased linearly with female size across all sites and decreased with increasing latitude. Estimates of reproductive output also indicated that fecundity was higher for females carrying late stage embryos, compared to freshly extruded eggs, which suggested that studies counting only uneyed embryos may underestimate fecundity. Measurements of embryos indicated that T. australiensis employs a strategy of high fecundity and small egg size relative to other thalassinids. Number of broods per female was not experimentally determined, although theoretical maximums of between 3 and 5 broods per season were estimated. Differences in patterns of relative growth between males and females explain sexual dimorphism in size and shape of primary chelae. Males also appeared to undergo a puberty moult at smaller sizes than females. The enlarged cheliped of male T. australiensis and other ghost shrimp is generally believed to be used in competitive interactions with other males, although more research is required to validate this hypothesis. Size at maturity as determined from analyses of relative growth was significantly related to latitude, with males and females from southern estuaries maturing at smaller sizes. However, estimates of female size at maturity from relative growth analyses did not compare well to sizes of ovigerous females, suggesting that the puberty moult may not coincide with gonad development. Future studies should attempt to determine male size at maturity based on reproductive condition rather than relying on analyses of relative growth data. Length frequency analyses indicated that T. australiensis is a fast growing species with a life-span of 3 to 4 years. Results suggesting a longer life-span at some sites are likely to be an artefact of the ELEFAN procedure. There were no consistent geographic trends in growth parameters, although lower growth rates and asymptotic lengths at sites in the Moruya River, probably reflect the smaller size of individuals in this estuary. Patterns of fishing mortality and exploitation ratios determined from stock assessment procedures suggest that populations across all sites are either currently under-exploited or approaching optimal harvesting rates. However, theses results are of a preliminary nature, given questions regarding the reliability of ELEFAN for some data sets. Recreational creel surveys at three locations (Maianbar, Shoalhaven Heads and Garlandtown) demonstrated that individual anglers frequently harvested large numbers (&gt; 200) of T. australiensis during single fishing trips. There were no differences in mean harvesting time between locations, with differences in CPUE therefore reflecting fishing quality. Boat-based anglers spent significantly less time harvesting than shore-based anglers. High rates of refusal to either participate in the survey, or allow catches to be handled, were consistent with other studies of T. australiensis in Australia and are related to time constraints and fragility of the organism. Anglers commonly underestimated number of shrimp harvested and over-estimated time spent harvesting, which has consequences for studies that rely on data from telephone surveys or diaries. Anglers removed large numbers of T. australiensis from individual locations during single low-tide periods. For example at the Maianbar site, mean estimated catch during a 6-hour low-tide event occurring on a summer weekend/holiday day, was over 4,500 individuals. Although total estimated harvests were considerable during the 6-month study period, recreational catches represented fewer than 2% of estimated stock sizes across all sites. A doubling of these estimates for an entire year was considered an overestimate of annual harvest, given that most angers claimed they did not harvest during winter months. The results of this research have been discussed in relation to the life-history of T. australiensis in south-eastern Australia, the harvesting of the species, the objectives of sustainable management of populations and scope for further research. Specifically, restrictive management is not advocated for T. australiensis in NSW. However, continued monitoring and research is necessary to determine the long-term ecological impacts of harvesting activities on populations, communities and habitats, as well as experimental tests of hypotheses constructed to explain observed patterns.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of titanium additions to low carbon, low manganese steels on sulphide precipitation</field><field name="creator">Aminorroaya-Yamini, Sima</field><field name="description">Recent developments of high strength line pipe steel have seen a decrease in carbon content from 0.25 wt% to less than 0.05 wt% and manganese to less than 1 wt% in an attempt to reduce centreline segregation. The sulphur content should be less than 0.008 wt% as well. However, recent papers argued that low manganese levels in pipeline steels have the potential to improve weld line toughness and allow a higher tolerance for sulphur. Should this be true it would be possible to eliminate the usual desulphurising treatments thereby decreasing the production cost. The current study was designed to explore the effect of titanium on sulphide precipitation in steels with higher sulphur contents than currently used in the pipeline industry. The mechanical properties of steels are influenced by the type, shape and size of sulphide precipitates. Titanium additions to low carbon steel influence the precipitation behavior and composition of sulphide precipitates and could provide grain refinement, precipitation strengthening and sulphide shape control. In the present study, titanium was added to a low carbon, low manganese steel which contained approximately 0.01 wt% sulphur in order to study the effect of titanium on sulphide formation in the absence of other alloying elements. Microscopic assessment of centreline sulphide precipitates revealed that irontitanium- sulphide co-exists with (Mn,Fe)S. An increase of the titanium content from 0.008 wt% to 0.024 wt%, results in an increase in the titanium content of irontitanium- sulphide phases and a decrease in the iron content of the (Mn,Fe)S phases. In contrast to reports in the literature where it has been suggested that titanium can dissolve in MnS and even that it is possible for TiS to replace MnS. This study has shown that Ti replaces iron in FeS but does not dissolve in manganese sulphides. The presence of FeTiS2 (trigonal CdI2-type structure with a P3m1 space group and lattice parameters of a = 0.34 nm and c = 0.57 nm) precipitates has been verified for the first time in steel. IV A concentric solidification technique in a laser-scanning confocal microscope was employed to observe in situ, solidification and the precipitation of sulphides following segregation of alloying elements into the remaining liquid. Microstructural development of low carbon steel upon solidification has been observed in situ, alloying element distributions were measured experimentally and sulphide precipitates have been compared to the precipitates at the centreline of continuously cast steel slabs. Microstructural development was similar in the two cases and some aspects of alloying element segregation upon solidification of a slab can be simulated experimentally by the use of the concentric solidification technique. There is a remarkable similarity between the sequence of events decreased in the in-situ observations and that occurring in industrially-cast slabs reported in the literature. Sulphide precipitates at the centreline of concentrically solidified specimens are similar in morphology and composition to precipitates in continuously cast steel slabs and TEM analysis confirmed that FeTiS2 as well as MnS (containing iron) can form on prior austenite grain boundaries in both cases. The progression of the solid/liquid interface in plain Fe-C and Fe-Ni alloys was simulated by using Diffusion Controlled TRAnsformation (DICTRA) software which operates in conjunction with Thermo-Calc. Good correlation was found between experimental results and computations. Solute build up in the liquid at the solid/liquid interface was determined experimentally in Fe-Ni alloys and there was good agreement between the calculated concentration gradient of nickel and experimental measurements using an EPMA technique. Therefore, it is possible to determine comparatively the centreline segregation with fairly elementary experimental procedures and mathematical simulation at various steel compositions if DICTRA and Thermo-Calc are provided with sufficiently accurate thermodynamic information. Precipitates which formed in the solid state were assessed by carbon replication techniques, transmission electron microscope studies and atom probe tomography. Manganese and copper sulphides were the dominant sulphide precipitates. Copper sulphides nucleated on manganese sulphides and formed a shell around rod-like and V globular manganese sulphides. Iron did not dissolve in manganese sulphides and therefore the manganese sulphides which formed in solid state have higher melting points than sulphides formed on prior austenite grain boundaries at the centreline of slab. Titanium nitrides were observed in various sizes and distributions. TiN acts as nucleation sites for the precipitation of sulphides. An increase of the titanium content from 0.008 wt% to 0.024 wt%, results in precipitation of a few micrometer TiN and a decrease in the number of small cubic TiN precipitates. Small particles (~ 10nm length and 3 nm thickness in size) that contain Ti, C, S and N have been identified for the first time by the use of three-dimensional atom probe tomography</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the novel surface protein P159 and the ribosomal protein L7/L12 of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</field><field name="creator">Burnett, Tracey A</field><field name="description">Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae colonise swine ciliated respiratory epithelia, leading to the development of porcine enzootic pneumonia. Heparin and other glycosaminoglycans are known to block adherence of this pathogen to porcine tracheal cilia, however adhesins with heparin-binding capacity have not been identified. Previous studies have implicated a 97 kDa surface protein of M. hyopneumoniae, P97 that appeared to be involved in the interaction of M. hyopneumoniae with swine cilia. This study aimed at identifying other potential adhesins of M. hyopneumoniae. In this study, immuno-electron microscopy and trypsin degradation analyses demonstrated that a 159 kDa protein (P159) resides on the surface of M. hyopneumoniae. Furthermore, proteomic analyses indicate that this molecule is post-translationally cleaved. In vitro, these proteins are found to be cleaved and highly expressed at all stages during the growth cycle of M. hyopneumoniae. This molecule was also shown to be immunogenic due to its reactivity with sera from pigs naturally infected with M. hyopneumoniae. Recombinant expression of P159 domains was undertaken (F1, F2, F3, and F4). Two of these domains (F3 and F4) were found to bind heparin in a dosedependent, saturable and specific manner. The Kd for this interaction was 142.37 + 22.01 nM for F3 and 75.37 + 7.34 nM for F4. Some pathogenic bacteria have been shown to bind heparin which can then bind to further components on the surface of cells, thereby acting as a bridging molecule in adhesion to host cells. Non-labeled heparin was shown to competitively inhibit this interaction with an IC50 value of 52.92 + 1.03 &#956;g/ml for F3 and 66.63 + 1.02 &#956;g/ml for F4. Fucoidan was also shown to competitively inhibit the binding of heparin to F3 (IC50 96.28 + 1.19 &#956;g/ml) and F4 (IC50 36.23 + 1.14 &#956;g/ml). Fluorescent and electron microscopic studies employing latex beads coated with P159 domains revealed that F2, F3 and F4 promoted adherence to the porcine epithelial-like cell line PK15. Additionally, F2 and F4 also mediated the uptake of the latex beads into PK15 cells. Collectively this data suggests that P159 is a good candidate for an adhesin of M. hyopneumoniae and thus may play a role in the colonization of the respiratory tract of swine. Ribosomal protein L7/L12 has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of bacterial pathogens in vitro, and has been found to be expressed on the cell surface of some pathogenic bacteria. While work in this study revealed that the L7/L12 molecule is cytoplasmically expressed in M.hyopneumoniae, an immunoreaction with convalescent pig serum indicated the protein has immunogenic properties. The immunogenicity of the M. hyopneumoniae L7/L12 protein may make it a potential target for vaccine development.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a numerical model of rock failure mechanisms associated with the impact of lateral displacement</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jong Wook</field><field name="description">Ground subsidence due to mining has been the subject of research for several decades, and it remains to be an important problem, which confronts the mining close to ecologically sensitive areas. This thesis is concerned with the development of a numerical simulation model of ground deformation, extended to ground movement under river channel systems present at the base of valleys. A number of numerical models have been developed for better understanding of the strata interactions using the two- imensional explicit finite difference code FLAC Version 4.0. The proposed model simulation is focused on the ground deformation, down to 30 meters below the river valley. Ground displacement, mainly lateral displacement has been observed by field monitoring and accordingly, artificial lateral displacement was created to study the deformational behaviour beneath the bottom of the valley. Lateral displacement around valley areas caused the closure of the valley and bulging of the valley floor, known as upsidence. Most of the numerical simulations carried out with FLAC demonstrated that valley closure and valley floor bulging were dependent on the shape and dimension of modelled geometry, strata properties, loading rate of lateral displacement, the magnitude and shape of loading, the presence of bedding planes and the presence of an underground water table. The inclusion of bedding planes or joints with known rock types was recommended for ground deformation simulations. The use of UDEC instead of FLAC was considered as an alternative to provide a better understanding of the effects of joints and bedding planes on subsidence and upsidence. Further studies are required for strata interaction when an underground water table is introduced to the model.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the effectiveness of Indonesia's coral reef management framework</field><field name="creator">Dirhamsyah,</field><field name="description">Coral reefs are one of the important components of coastal and marine ecosystems in Indonesia.

At least 70% of Indonesia&#65533;s coral reefs are under rigorous threat and this is now considered one of the most serious environmental problems in the country. This thesis analyses the challenges of managing coral reef ecosystems in Indonesia. The problems identified include: lack of community participation; weakness in national and local legislative framework; lack of national policy and planning; lack of law enforcement and compliance systems; weakness in institutional arrangements for coastal and coral reef resources management; and most importantly, the general lack of political and bureaucratic commitment and lack of interagency cooperation at the national and regional government levels. The thesis concludes with several recommendations for improving the management of coastal and coral reef resources and their ecosystems. The recommendations include: the application of community-based management or co-management concepts in coastal and coral reef resources management; the establishment of a national ocean policy; amendment of several natural resource laws and the enactment of a new integrated natural resources law; the establishment of horizontal and vertical interagency cooperative mechanisms for policy and management planning and implementation; the establishment of national and regional law enforcement units; and the creation of a new Coordinating Ministry for Ocean Activities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel conducting polymer structures for electrochemical actuators</field><field name="creator">Xi, Binbin</field><field name="description">Electrochemical actuators based on conducting polymers and conducting polymer/carbon nanotube composites have been constructed and characterised. The actuation performance was optimised in terms of the actuation strain, cycle life, stability and work-per-cycle. Different conducting polymers, such as polypyrrole, polythiophene, and polyaniline were investigated as actuator materials. More reproducible and stable strain response from polypyrrole actuators has been achieved by the combination of current pulsing control for electrochemical stimulation and ionic liquid for the electrolyte. Current pulsing ensures that the oxidation and reduction processes are equal in their magnitude and prevents the slow net oxidation (or reduction) that typically occurs during symmetrical voltage cycling. Ionic liquid electrolytes permit higher current densities to be applied to the polymer because the polymer can endure a wider potential window in ionic liquids. Also, operation of polypyrrole actuators in ionic liquids produces much smaller changes in elastic modulus, thus resulting in a more stable isotonic strain with increasing applied loads and a higher work-per-cycle. The effect of dopants, potential scan rate and electrolyte temperature on actuation performance is also investigated for polypyrrole actuators. For polythiophene actuators, an increasing strain response was observed under increasing applied loads when operated in ionic liquids as electrolytes. This is the first time that conducting polymer actuators have been reported to exhibit an increasing strain with increasing applied loads. Using the phase inversion technique, polyaniline actuators were prepared in different geometrical configurations such as films, tubes and tubes with a platinum wire as helix. The actuation strain of the polyaniline actuator was significantly increased by incorporating a platinum wire as helix configuration into the polymer in acid solution electrolyte. However, the porous nature and subsequent brittleness of the polyaniline actuators prepared using the phase inversion technique has restricted their actuation performance and limited practical application. The use of carbon nanotubes as reinforcement fillers and electrical conductors in polyaniline was investigated due to the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes such as high tensile strength, Young&#65533;s modulus, and electrical conductivity. Polyaniline/carbon nanotube composite actuators were fabricated aiming to improve the actuation behaviour. Layered composite actuators consisting of polypyrrole, polyaniline and carbon nanotubes were fabricated by coating a polyaniline/carbon nanotube solution onto the polypyrrole tube and drying on a hotplate. Polyaniline/carbon nanotube composite fibre actuators were prepared using a wet-spinning process. The presence of carbon nanotubes allowed high stresses to be applied to the composite actuators. The actuation performance of the composite actuators is enhanced by the carbon nanotubes as reinforcement fillers in conducting polymers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Islandman translated: Tomas O'Crohan, autobiography and the politics of culture</field><field name="creator">Lucchitti, Irene</field><field name="description">The writings of Tomas O'Crohan in the early twentieth century were celebrated upon publication as icons of Irishness and the voice of the mysterious Gaeltacht expressing itself at last and just in time. Appearing at a sensitive time in Irish history, the reading of these texts as relics of an heroic Irish past nourished hopes of a brave Irish future. Their English translations, though received no less enthusiastically, have often been dismissed as imperfect and undesirable conduits to the author. Informed by the basic theme of dialogue, this thesis examines the politics of culture that brought the Islandman, man and book, into being, and that have surrounded the texts since they first appeared. It considers both the autobiography itself and the translation in terms of cultural process as well as product. It identifies the desire to control the reading of the texts as a legacy of the Gaelic League desire to wall the Irish culture in and examines it from several points of view - most notably from the points of view of translation theory, autobiography theory and, to a lesser extent, post-colonial theory. These modes of enquiry show that the sites of constraint imposed upon the texts reflect a cultural anxiety about what is revealed about this community that was made to represent Ireland. They demonstrate that the conventional reading of the texts, which privileges Tom's' fisherman identity, has veiled the writer protagonist inscribed in the texts, subordinating his identity as a writer to his identity as a peasant. The thesis contests the reading of Tom's' work as 'representative' and 'authentic' with a recognition of the personal aspects of the individual self that Tom's inscribed in his work.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relation between toughness and molecular coupling at cross-linked polymer/solid interfaces</field><field name="creator">Tymichova, Michaela</field><field name="description">The relationship between the interfacial fracture toughness (Gc) and molecular coupling between epoxy polymers and silicon wafers was studied using the asymmetric double cantilever test (ADCT). In order to investigate the molecular coupling, the coupling molecules had to be applied along the polymer/substrate interface in various concentrations. The grafting from technique by means of the &#65533;living&#65533; free radical polymerisation techniques, namely nitroxy-mediated &#65533;living&#65533; free polymerisation (NMP) and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), were used to prepare suitable coupling molecules. Unfortunately, these techniques did not produce satisfactory results, and the new route of grafting to was investigated. This method involved chemical attachment of brominated polystyrene chains (PS) to the silicon substrate. The bromine functional groups of the brominated polystyrene (PS(Br)) were then further converted to amino (-NH2) groups using the Heck reaction, producing PS(NH2). The conversion method was first tested using the free (unattached) polystyrene (MW = 200K) which was brominated (molar fraction of brominated units, x = 0.1). The conversion from PS to PS(Br) and then to PS(NH2) was monitored by proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance techniques (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR) and gel permeation chromatography. For the grafting to experiments, monochlorosilane end-functionalised polystyrene (PS-SiClMe2) (MW = 8000) was used. Various ratios of PS and PS(Br) ranging from 0 to 20% PS(Br) were deposited onto silicon substrates. Applying the Heck reaction, Br groups were converted to NH2, producing surfaces with different concentrations of amino groups which were expected to react with the epoxy polymer. ADCT was adapted to investigate the dependence of the interfacial fracture toughness on the degree of coupling. The dependence of Gc on the concentration of the coupling molecules was not directly confirmed. This was attributed mainly to the challenges in deposition of the polymer chains and the final conversion to PS(NH2). However, the differences in Gc values between experiments suggested that Gc&#65533;s measured by ADCT reflect the differences in surface properties of the polymer modified surfaces, and therefore this technique is suitable for interfacial adhesion measurements between epoxy polymers and solid substrate.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuum mechanics approaches to the study of fracture and fatigue in metals</field><field name="creator">Glass, Bradley Smyth</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates continuum mechanics based means of metal failure assessment. A basic science approach was employed throughout the study to examine the fundamental relationships responsible for metal failure. The extension of previously existing continuum mechanics based theories to encompass a wider range of application was considered in this thesis. Research was conducted as two separate studies which examine specific aspects of the metal failure spectrum, namely failure due to monotonic loading, and fatigue failure due to cyclic loading. The failure due to monotonic loading research was conducted to examine the influence of hydrostatic stress on metal ductility. A fundamental relationship in the form of a monotonic failure criterion was proposed based on a relationship between equivalent plastic fracture strain and hydrostatic stress. An experimental program incorporating uniaxial tensile testing of notched specimens was conducted to examine the proposed relationship for the hydrostatic tensile stress range. Finite element analyses were produced to confirm the mechanical properties and obtain the stress-strain state present at specimen failure. A good correlation was established between the load-displacement results obtained from experiment and finite element analysis, providing confirmation of the stress-strain data. The stress-strain results confirmed the existence of a relationship between hydrostatic stress and ductility in the form of a monotonically decreasing value of equivalent plastic fracture strain with increasing hydrostatic tensile stress. The relationship determined was in accordance with the trend indicated by various researchers for the hydrostatic compressive stress range. The potential application of such a criterion to finite element methods was amply demonstrated from this research. The fatigue failure due to cyclic loading research examined the application of energy based methods to fatigue life characterisation. Based on the hypothesis that irreversible damage may be attributed entirely to plastic deformation, the application of the plastic strain energy approach to the entire fatigue life spectrum was pursued. For application to high cycle fatigue, a thermodynamic approach was developed to allow plastic strain energy determination beyond the range of application of conventional mechanical measurement. Thermodynamic models consisting of varying degrees of free surface contribution to heat dissipation were developed as possible representations of the high cycle fatigue damage process. An experimental program was conducted incorporating mechanical and thermodynamic means of measurement. Thermodynamic measurement was achieved via an experimental apparatus incorporating precision temperature measurement and thermal isolation at the specimen surface. Assuming an appropriate thermodynamic model, a finite difference analysis allowed a quantitative determination of plastic strain energy. Close agreement was indicated from comparison of the low cycle fatigue plastic strain energy results obtained from mechanical and thermodynamic measurement. A qualitative determination of plastic strain energy for high cycle fatigue was achieved, subject to confirmation of the thermodynamic model. The qualitative assessment verified the existence of measurable plastic strain energy during high cycle fatigue.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of berberine-based derivatives as novel antimicrobial agents</field><field name="creator">Samosorn, Siritron</field><field name="description">Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by a drug efflux mechanism is one of the major drug resistance problems not only in bacteria but also in other microorganisms. NorA MDR efflux protein is a well characterized and major efflux pump in the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus. It contributes to the resistance to berberine and ciprofloxacin antibiotics by extrusion of these drugs from the cells of S. aureus. In order to overcome this type of drug resistance by dual action agents incorporating efflux pump inhibitor properties and antibacterial activity, a variety of new, aryl group-substituted 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indole efflux pump inhibitors were synthesized. In the synthesis of these 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indoles, a new procedure for the N-acylation of indoles was developed based on DCC/DMAP coupling with carboxylic acids. This method was particularly effective with 5-nitro-1H-indole. The activity of these indole derivatives as inhibitors of the NorA MDR pump in S. aureus was assessed. It was found that some of the 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indole derivatives potentiated the activity of the antibacterial agents berberine and ciprofloxacin against the resistant strain, K2361, of S. aureus. The new 2-aryl-5-nitro-1H-indole inhibitors were particularly effective in potentiating the antibacterial activity of berberine. The compound [4-benzyloxy-2-(5-nitro-1H-2-yl)-phenyl]-methanol (43) was the most potent NorA pump inhibitor found in this work. A number of dual action antibacterial agents were designed and synthesized. These included dual action prodrugs, in which the MDR pump inhibitor and berberine were attached in the same molecule with enzymatically cleavable linkages (ester or amide groups), and dual action drugs with a non-cleavable linkage (methylene group). In the synthesis of the dual action agents, a direct new approach to 13-substituted berberine derivatives was found. This approach involved alkylation of 8-allyldihydroberberine followed by the elimination of propene. The antimicrobial activity of these indole-berberine compounds was assessed against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. One of the dual action drugs, 9,10-dimethoxy-13-[2-(5-nitro-1H-indol-2-yl)benzyl]-5,6-dihydrobenzo[g]-1,3-benzodioxolo[5,6-a]quinolizinium bromide (64), was a potent antimicrobial agent at a clinically viable concentration against various bacteria in vitro, including Staphylococcus aureus K2361, Enterococcus faecalis V583, and Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium SL1344R2. This compound also had good activity against the protozoan, Plasmodium falciparum K1 (in vitro). In the case of the dual action prodrugs, the amide prodrugs were more active than the ester prodrugs against the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus and vice versa against the Gram-negative bacterium S. enterica Serovar Typhimurium. However, minimum inhibitory concentrations for all the dual action drugs and dual action prodrugs were near or at clinically useful concentrations (ca. 1&#65533;&#65533;g/mL or less) as antibacterial agents against S. enterica Serovar Typhimurium SL1344R2, and they showed 400- to 1600-fold higher activity than the parent antibacterial agent berberine. The design principle of having in the one molecule an MDR inhibitor moiety and an antibacterial moiety was established as a viable one, which potentially could be extended to other types of antimicrobial agents.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The violin and piano music of Raymond Hanson</field><field name="creator">Collins, Susan May</field><field name="description">Raymond Hanson wrote eight works for violin and piano. The remaining seven of these represent a substantial body of work for the violin/piano combination, of a style not usually associated with Australian composition. These works are not well known today. The ABC&#65533;s 78 disc recordings of some of the works have been destroyed, and copies of the music are not easily accessed. Manuscript scores of these works are housed in the Rare Music Collection at the Sydney Conservatorium. Only one of the manuscripts includes a separate violin part. All of the manuscripts contain incomplete and inconsistent elements, particularly in respect to performance indications of phrasing, articulation and dynamic for the violin. The aim of this thesis is to edit all of the available works for violin and piano by Hanson, maintaining the integrity of the composer&#65533;s work. There are four areas of investigation. Hanson&#65533;s stated opinions and philosophies are discussed in terms of how they may have had an impact on his compositional style. A stylistic analysis of the works is conducted to identify specific compositional techniques that could give rise to stylistic comparisons with other known composers. The works are analysed for possible idiosyncratic use of performance indications, and there is an investigation into performance practices relating to the violin at the time these works were written. The findings help to place these works by Hanson in the context of the music of his time both in Australia and the rest of the world. This provides a base of technical and stylistic references from which to draw conclusions about the undetermined aspects of the manuscripts. Consequently, the findings have led to a clearer stylistic understanding of Hanson&#65533;s music relating to the violin, and have shaped the decisions made editing the manuscripts.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The asymmetric synthesis of polyhydroxylated pyrrolizidine alkaloids</field><field name="creator">Tang, Minyan</field><field name="description">Chapter 1 of this thesis is a review of the literature on the structure, biological activities and synthesis of polyhydroxylated 3-hydroxymethylpyrrolizidine alkaloids.

Chapter 2 describes model synthetic chemical studies on the synthesis of the pyrrolizidine core structure. The key synthetic steps, the aminolysis reaction of vinyl expoxides with ally1 amine, the ring-closing metathesis of the resulting diene, syndihydroxylation of the 2,5-dihydropyrrole product and finally ring closure to give the pyrrolizidine nucleus were successfully developed.

Two unnatural pyrrolizidine alkaloids, (-)-7-espiaustraline and (+)-1,7-diepiaustraline were successfully synthesized. The oxazolidinone group was found to be a useful protecting group in the RCM reaction and, as part of a pyrrolo[1,2-c]oxazol-3-one ring system, functioned as a stereo- and regio-directing group, in a key diastereoselective syn-dihydroxylation reaction and a regioselective nucleophilic ring-opening of a S,S-dioxo-dioxathiole. Chapter 4 describes the asymmetric synthesis of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid, (+)-1-epiaustraline. Attempts to extend this methodology to the synthesis of australine were not successful since the final pyrrolidine ring closure to produce the desired pyrrolizine was not productive.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring of seagrasses in Lake Illawarra, NSW</field><field name="creator">Tadkaew, Nichanan</field><field name="description">This research investigated the natural variability in leaf, shoot and meadow characteristics of Zostera capricorni in a coastal lagoon in SE Australia. The primary objective was to determine a set of parameters which may be indicative of the health of the major seagrass beds and which could be adopted in any long-term monitoring program. The study site was Lake Illawarra, a micro-tidal coastal lagoon located approximately 80 km south of Sydney (Australia), which contains approximately 5km2 of seagrass beds. A pilot study investigated the optimum quadrat size and sample size for measuring seagrass characteristics, given the natural variability of seagrasses in the Lake. It was found that 20 quadrats of 0.25 m2 could detect a change in seagrass percent cover of about 40% or more. The main study was carried out during winter and spring (2005) at three locations containing extensive seagrass beds, namely: Windang Peninsula; Bevans Island; and, Haywards Bay. At each location, sites were chosen at two depths, shallow (~ 1 m depth) and deep (~ 2m depth). Leaf, shoot and meadow parameters were assessed at each depth and location for each season. The measurements were designed to minimize damage to the seagrass beds. Leaf parameters assessed were number of leaves per shoot, maximum leaf length, leaf area per shoot, leaf mass, epiphyte mass and ratio of epiphyte to leaf mass. Percent cover was the major shoot parameter measured. Meadow condition was investigated by a relatively new technique involving small-scale strip mapping.Results indicated that maximum leaf length, leaf area, leaf mass, epiphyte mass and ratio of epiphyte to leaf mass displayed consistent patterns with significant differences between seasons and depths. Percent cover exhibited no consistent pattern between depths and seasons. The small-scale strip maps revealed differences in the degree and type of fragmentation of seagrass meadows between different sites. Overall, these studies suggested that leaf characteristics such as maximum leaf length, leaf area, epiphyte mass and ratio of epiphyte to leaf mass would be useful as indicators of the relative health of seagrass beds in Lake Illawarra. The small-scale mapping, which detected patterns in bed fragmentation, appeared to be an excellent early warning indicator of disturbance. As a result of this research, a protocol has been suggested for monitoring the seagrass meadows in Lake Illawarra.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contaminant transport processes in onsite waste disposal systems</field><field name="creator">Bunsri, Thidarat</field><field name="description">Groundwater contamination is an important environmental problem to the present day. The groundwater pollution caused by pathogens from human excreta, particularly in developing countries is directly associated with the lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation. A septic system is the simplest and the most economic onsite sanitation unit. It includes a tank and a drainage field. A septic tank is designed to receive domestic wastewater, especially black and grey, or a combination of both. Due to the worldwide spread of septic tank usage, it was estimated that they disposed of the largest volumes of wastewater into the ground through their drainage fields. Poorly discharged effluent often contains high concentrations of organic carbon, nutrients and pathogens. Therefore, there is a need to develop a model for estimating the migration of contaminants in a drainage field. The aim of this study was to develop a model for the transport and fate of pollutants discharged by a septic tank below the ground surface. Firstly, a conceptual model was developed to describe removal mechanisms and the fate of contaminants such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate, phosphate and Escherichia Coli (E.Coli) in unsaturated soil conditions. The governing equations were formulated to support the established conceptual model. The migration of contaminants depends on the advection-dispersion transport and retardation processes that can be evaluated using a modified form of the Richards equation. The retardations are mainly due to adsorption and biodegradation processes that are traditionally described using the multiplicative Monods equations and isotherm equation, respectively. Secondly, a mathematical model was developed by modifying these governing equations. The mathematical model is in the form of hyperbolic/parabolic partial differential equations with strong nonlinearity due to pressure head dependencies in the specific moisture capacity, hydraulic conductivity terms and complex retardation processes. In order to solve the mathematical model, a numerical approach was employed. The developed model was solved numerically using the Galerkin finite element method. The numerical model was coded with MATLAB software. Finally, the developed model was calibrated using the writers laboratory data and other data obtained from case studies. The movement of water and wastewater and the retardation of contaminants were investigated experimentally and the results of these experiments were compared with the simulations of the developed model. Two types of porous media were used, sand and topsoil. Sand is a uniform and non-reactive porous medium which provides an effective permeability for infiltration. Topsoil is a non-uniform and reactive porous medium which provides various rates of retardation. The infiltration experiments were conducted using laboratory and pilot scale columns of 20 and 120 cm effective heights, respectively. Laboratory scale sand and soil columns were used to determine the hydraulic properties of sand and soil, the movement of water with various boundary conditions such as gravitational, static equilibrium of capillary and infiltrationredistribution flows. A pilot scale soil column was used to examine the transport of contaminants in field conditions. The computational code used in the advective-dispersive transport (Richards equation) was applied to the data obtained from the laboratory scale soil columns. The simulation results for the hydraulic pressure head and moisture content in both sand and soil columns matched the observed data well. The contaminant transport model could satisfactorily estimate the contaminant concentration and retardation zone. The simulation results indicate that all contaminants except E.Coli were reduced significantly across a 15 cm depth (elevation of 105 cm) whereas the E.Coli reduction zone was observed within 10 cm depth (elevation of 110 cm) of the soil column. Eight case studies were used in the model verification processes. The developed model could effectively predict the profiles of pressure head and moisture content observed in infiltration and infiltration-redistribution systems. Furthermore, the developed model could predict the profiles of non-reactive and reactive contaminant concentrations presented in all the case studies. This indicates that the developed model is an effective alternative tool for predicting the migration of contaminants in the ground underneath a septic effluent drainage field.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced materials for electrodes and electrolyte in rechargeable lithium batteries</field><field name="creator">Chew, Sau yen</field><field name="description">The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery possesses many outstanding advantages over the well known rechargeable battery systems, in particularly higher energy density and longer shelf life, as well as not suffering from the memory effect problems of Ni-MH batteries. Those advantages are making it the greatest energy source of choice for the portable electronic market. Graphite and LiCoO2 are commonly used in commercial Li-ion battery. Despite their widespread utilization, the current electro-active materials have reached to a limit in terms of delivering even higher power, energy density, and longer cycle life for the new, emerging field of large-scale energy storage systems, such as in the automotive industry. Hybrid and fully electric cars need safer, cheaper, and higher performing batteries in order to offer an important alternative to combustion engines. To overcome the shortcomings of the current Li-ion battery, improvements are needed to push the Li-ion technology to the next level. Hence, the motivation for this PhD work is to search for potential electro-active materials, by means of the synthesis of film and powder based electrodes, fine-tuning of the composition of the composite electrodes, and characterization of them for possible application in Li-ion rechargeable batteries. Among the anode candidates studied were free-standing carbon nanotube (CNT) films, tin glycolate, and polypyrrole coated silicon (Si-PPy) nanocomposite materials. Two cathode candidates were also studied: lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) thin film, and polypyrrole coated lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8-PPy) composite. Ionic liquid based polymer electrolyte was also studied to enhance Li-ion battery safety features. Free-standing CNT film electrodes have been synthesized by a simple vacuum filtration method. The free-standing electrodes were produced without any binder or metal current collector, which significantly reduced the total weight. The free-standing CNT film electrodes were also flexible and had good electrical conductivity with the addition of carbon black. Three different types of CNTs were used, i.e. single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs), double-wall CNTs (DWCNTs) and multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs). The films based on MWCNT are much better than SWCNT and DWCNT films in terms of their electrochemical performance, with stable cycling behavior of 300 mAh g-1 after 40 cycles. A detailed study revealed that MWCNT electrode exhibited a reversible, sharp, and intense peak at approximately 0.15 V vs. Li/Li+ during the Li+ de-intercalation process. A thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was observed on the surface of MWCNTs after prolonged cycling. This proved that only multi-wall CNTs have the capability for significant Li+ ion intercalation/de-intercalation. Novel tin glycolate particles were prepared by the polyol-mediated method. The prepared powders consist of fine tin-based particles (80 &#8211; 120 nm), encapsulated within tin glycolate shells. When applied as an anode material for Li-ion batteries, the glycolate shells buffered the volume expansion upon Li-Sn alloying, and thus the tin glycolate particles showed a high specific charge of 416 mAh g-1 beyond 50 cycles. Novel Si-PPy nanocomposite was prepared by coating the Si particle surfaces with PPy by the in situ chemical polymerization method. The cycle stability of Si-PPy nanocomposite electrodes was greatly enhanced with 50 wt. % PPy. The loading level of PPy plays a major role in determining the stability of the nanocomposite, and consequently creates a good matrix to improve the electrical conductivity, buffer the volume change during cycling, and prevent cracking and pulverization of the Si. A new approach was developed to rapidly synthesize nanostructured LiMn2O4 thin films by flame spray deposition (FSD) and in situ annealing. The LiMn2O4 films on stainless steel current collector exhibited good cyclability, with two pairs of redox peaks at approximately 4.00 and 4.15 V vs. Li/Li+. The study indicated that spinel LiMn2O4 thin films can be prepared by the fast and efficient FSD method. LiV3O8-PPy composites were synthesized by a low-temperature solution route followed by an in situ polymerization method. For LiV3O8 material, only 24 wt. % of PPy is needed to enhance the electrical conductivity and stability of the composite electrode, which delivered a specific charge of 183 mAh g-1 beyond 100 cycles. A solution casting method was used to prepare IL-PE composite membrane. The composite membrane was then assembled with LiV3O8-PPy (24 wt. % PPy) composite cathode and tested as a lithium polymer battery at room temperature. The cell delivered 200 mAh g-1 with respect to the mass of the cathode material.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wildflowers and White porcelain</field><field name="creator">McCue, Jules C</field><field name="description">The seed is a symbol of fertility and as in the case of Sue Norrie's paintings of the earlier nineteen eighties, the seed is a symbol of abundance.[2] Fertility, abundance, ritual, the theatre of emotions and metaphysics: still life - the content of which has passed through many visual forms.

Its high water solubility makes it a potentially very attractive material for a range of applications. However, to date problems with its synthesis from MAS monomer and the impure nature of the PMAS product have hindered its exploitation. This thesis successfully addresses these problems and then subsequently exploits the pure high molecular weight PMAS obtained as a novel electroactive dopant in composite materials with other conducting polymers.The initial focus of this thesis was the development of a rapid purification technique capable of fractionating in gram scale quantities the crude mixture of PMAS and low molecular weight oligomers formed in establish d syntheses of PMAS. A new method was successfully established using cross flow tangential filtration to obtain, for the first time, the high purity, high molecular weight (HMWt) and low molecular weight (LMWt) PMAS fractions. Gel permeation chromatography, UV-visible spectroscopy and four point probe conductivity were used for characterisation of these fractions. The new separation technique was found to be a more efficient, rapid and scalable method for purification of PMAS than the conventional dialysis previously employed. Results have shown that the presence of the LMWt PMAS has an unexpected influence upon the electronic properties of the HMWt PMAS such that conductivity increases by two fold after its effective removal.Detailed optimisation studies were then performed on the synthesis of PMAS via the chemical polymerisation of 2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid (MAS) monomer, using ammonium persulfate as oxidant. These demonstrated that experimental variables such as time, temperature, monomer  oncentration, pH, and the rate of addition of oxidant influence the yield, molecular weight and conductivity of the resultant PMAS. Employing the optima l synthetic conditions resulted in a HMWt PMAS product with enhanced conductivity of 1.74 &#177; 0.09 S/cm, Mp 16,900 and recovered yield (after tangential cross flow filtration) of 50 % w/w.The pure HMWt and LMWt PMAS fractions obtained following the above purification were fully characterised using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spin resonance (ESR), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The HMWt PMAS fraction (Mn 13,400 kDa, Mw 33,600 kDa, Mp 16,900 kDa and PDI 2.5) was found to be paramagnetic due to the presence of radical cations (polarons). In contrast, the LMWt PMAS fraction (Mn 2,400 kDa, Mw ,700 kDa, Mp 2,800 kDa and PDI 1.1) was non-electroactive and non-conducting with no paramagnetic properties. Both HMWt and LMWt PMAS fractions exhibited nanodimensional morphology. The recently reported photoluminescence properties of PMAS have been reassessed in this thesis, revealing that the LMWt PMAS fraction in the presence of HMWt PMAS was the source of the unexpected photoemission reported for aqueous PMAS. In contrast, pure HMWt PMAS was found to statically quench the photoluminescence of LMWt PMAS.These optimisation and purification studies provided an opportunity to study, for the first time, the incorporation of pure HMWt PMAS as a conducting polyelectrolyte dopant without the complication of oligomeric impurities, which were shown above to dramatically influence the properties of PMAS. Pure HMWt PMAS was incorporated as a dopant during chemical and electrochemical polymerisation of substituted polyaniline (PAn). PAn/PMAS materials were prepared as water-insoluble films using  electrochemical polymerisation, and as highly dispersed nanomaterials via chemical polymerisation of aniline in the presence of HMWt PMAS. The incorporation of PMAS into the polyaniline was confirmed by elemental analysis, UV-vis spectroscopy and CV studies. The conductivity of the PAn/PMAS nanomaterial was found to be 3.0 &#177; 0.18 S/cm, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that reported for polyaniline in the presence of non-conducting  olyelectrolytes, such as poly styrenesulfonate). Signifcantly, this new class of material exhibited conductivity at neutral pH values where polyanilineitself is de-doped to give a non-conducting material.The enhanced PAn/PMAS stability was xploited in this thesis in the area of electrochromics, giving an enhanced electrochromic contrast (57.0 %&#916;T at  770 nm). Its extended pH stability will also permit future studies into the utility of these materials in biological environments, which to date have been unavailable in unsubstituted PAn due to its lack of conductivity and electroactivity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of nano-scaled structures, devices and materials</field><field name="creator">Cox, Barry James</field><field name="description">Problems from three specific areas of nanotechnology are examined in this thesis. Firstly, new models for nanostructures of carbon are presented. The structures of primary interest are carbon nanotubes and related nanoscale toroidal molecules of pure carbon. Following this, the mechanics of carbon nanotubes interacting with atoms and fullerenes is examined. Acted on by van derWaals forces alone, a fullerene can oscillate at high frequencies inside an open-ended carbon nanotube. The frequencies obtained are predicted to be in the gigahertz range and these so-called &#8220;gigahertz oscillators&#8221; provide the  primary motivation for this part of the thesis. Lastly, the electrostatic problem of uncharged particles at close interstice subject to an external applied electric field is explored. This is a problem of interest for a class of material called &#8220;electrorheological fluids&#8221; and various aspects of particle geometry are examined.In this thesis the conventional theory which prescribes the geometric parameters of carbon nanotubes is examined and it is found that it does not adequately account for the curvature inherent in the structure of nanotubes. By considering three postulates and then applying geometry and trigonometry, a polyhedral model is proposed and new formulae are derived which provide more precise expressions for geometric parameters such as the chiral angle, radius and unit length. Asymptotic expansions of these expressions are also shown to produce the conventional formulae as the leading order terms. Following this, approximately toroidal molecules are described which are formed from carbon nanotubes which have defects that cause a bend in an otherwise straight nanotube. The angle of the bend is determined and then expressions are derived giving the dimensions for tori formed from a number of these bend defects. Representative formulae for the ideal tori parameters, of generating radius and tube radius, are determined from integral expressions for the circumference and surface area of the ideal surface.The part of this thesis concerned with the mechanics of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes is primarily focussed on the van der Waals interactions between these types of molecules. The particular application of fullerenes oscillating inside of carbon nanotubes is examined in detail and the terms &#8220;suction energy&#8221; and &#8220;acceptance energy&#8221; are introduced here for the first time to describe the general behaviour of such systems. Following this, the equilibrium offset position for a fullerene inside of a carbon nanotube is determined as a function of the radius and the oscillatory motion is modelled using Dirac delta functions, which enables an expression for the frequency of oscillation to be given. This method is extended from spherical fullerenes to those of a spheroidal shape and then extended further to a semi-analytical method which gives the interaction between a carbon nanotube and any molecule which can be modelled as an arbitrary surface of revolution.Electrorheological (ER) fluids are a class of material which undergo a dramatic change in viscosity when an external electric field is applied. In this thesis an overview of the various theories used to model this induced force of attraction is given, including a brief outline the major mathematical results and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods. In particular, a detailed description of the re-expansion method is given which is then used to produce solutions to three specific problems. The first problem is that of same sized particles (i.e. a monodisperse ER fluid) at close interstice and it is demonstrated that the re-expansion method provides a solution that is more congruent with experimental results than a number of other methods. Following this, the method is expanded to the problem of a bidisperse ER fluid comprising nonidentical particles. In the analysis of this solution new genuine maxima are found for various ratios of particle size, dielectric constants and particle spacing. Lastly, the method is applied to nonidentical conducting particles with dielectric coatings and a solution for this geometry is derived. Analysing this final solution in various limits also derives a useful approximation for thinly coated conducting particles.In summary, the major original contributions contained in this thesis are: a new polyhedral model for the structure of carbon nanotubes; a novel method for determining the bend angle in polyhedral nanotori and the prediction of new toroidal forms of carbon; the concepts of suction and acceptance energy and a new simple description of the mechanics of gigahertz oscillators; an innovative method to calculate the interaction energy for surfaces of revolution; the discovery of new genuine maxima in the force of attraction for bidisperse ER fluids; and, a new solution for conducting particles with dielectric coatings, which leads to an innovative approximation for thin coatings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Phyotoestrogens in the aquatic environment using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Kang, Jinguo</field><field name="description">Phytoestrogens are a subclass of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Like other EDCs, research has demonstrated that phytoestrogens also have adverse effects on wildlife in the aquatic environment. In the past few years, many analytical methods have been developed. However, most of them were for natural and synthetic estrogens or pharmaceuticals in the environment, and very few involved phytoestrogens. So far as we know, there are no literature reports about the occurrence of enterolignans in the environment and wastewater samples. So, the occurrence and distribution of the three important type phytoestrogens (isoflavone, enterolignans and coumestrol) in the aquatic environmental samples and wastewater need to be fully investigated in order to assess their potential impact. In this work, a simultaneous LC-ESI-MSn analytical method for the analysis of the important phytoestrogen isoflavones, enterolinans, and coumestrol at nanogram / L levels in the aquatic environment and wastewater samples has been developed and optimised. This method was successfully used in the analysis of different aqueous samples with high selectivity and sensitivity. This LC-ESI-MSn analytical method has been validated by its sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. The method detection limit (MDL) was found to be from 0.1 to 3 ng/L in surface water and STP effluent; and ranged from 0.5 to 5 ng/L in STP influent. Accuracy was determined by the recovery experiments and evaluated by relative standard deviation (RSD %). The average recoveries of the all analytes in the different matrix samples were ranged from 85% to 95%. The RSD (%) values for all analytes in the surface water and STP effluent were found &amp;lt6.5%, and in STP influent sample were &amp;lt8.1%. Signal suppression is a common problem in the LC-ESI-MS quantitative analysis. In this work matrix effects were tackled by two ways: one way was to reduce the matrix interference by optimisation of sample preparation and improvement of chromatographic separation, another way was to select an appropriate calibration approach to further compensate the remaining matrix effects. Although approaches applied in sample preparation have effectively reduced the matrix interference, the matrix interference could not be totally eliminated from the sample extracts. Internal standard has shown to be the best way to compensate for matrix effects, but in the multi-component analysis one internal standard was deficient in compensating for the signal suppression on all analytes. Finding internal standards for each analytes is often difficult or impossible. To solve this problem and further compensate for remaining matrix effects, a matrix-matched calibration approach was selected. It has been clearly demonstrated in a systematic study that matrix-matched calibration with one internal standard is thus a practical alternative option to compensate for residual matrix effects in multi-component analysis of environmental samples. With the increasing use of mass spectrometric techniques for identification and quantitation, a clear understanding of the fragmentation behaviour of the analysed phytoestrogen isoflavones, enterolignans and coumestrol is required. This enhanced understanding will, in addition, aid the structural identification of other flavonoids by MS. To our knowledge, no systematic study has been reported of the fragmentation and structures of isoflavones in negative ion electrospray ionization mode by multi-stage mass spectrometric (MSn) fragmentation using ion trap mass spectrometry. Furthermore, enterolignans and coumestrol are two important types of phytoestrogens, but so far as we know, there is no literature has been reported on their MS fragmentation pathways. The fragmentation studies of isoflavones have elucidated the fragmentation pathway for deprotonated isoflavones in electrospray ionization using MSn ion trap mass spectrometry and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The fragmentation pathway of enterodiol, enterolactone and coumestrol were also proposed for the first time. Analytical results in this work showed that all analysed phytoestrogens were found to be present at trace levels in the aquatic environment, whilst some of the analytes were present at comparative high concentrations such as daidzein and enterolactone. Comparatively high levels of daidzein, enterolactone, genistein and formononetin were also detected in dairy farm runoff. Enterolactone were analysed in aquatic environment samples for the first time and was found at comparatively high levels. In wastewater samples, high levels of analytes were found in the STP influent. But in the STP effluent samples, concentrations of the analysed phytoestrogens were found at very low concentrations, especially in the final treated effluent from advanced tertiary treatment plants. These analytical results suggest that the source of phytoestrogen contamination in the environment samples seems not limited to the discharges of STP effluent, but was more likely attributed to the waste from livestock in the nearby farmyards. Comparatively higher levels of the analytes detected in the dairy farm runoff water samples supported the supposition. Another possible contamination of the analysed phytoestrogens is the dried and spoiled grass on the ground and in the farm grass silage, but more research on the livestock waste and spoiled grass are needed to make this conclusion, and would be interesting.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An intimate monument (re)-narrating 'the troubles' in Northern Ireland: the Irish Linen Memorial 2001-2005</field><field name="creator">Trouton, Lycia Danielle</field><field name="description">The Irish Linen Memorial creative project is an ongoing site conscious memorial installation which seeks to re narrate the almost 4,000 deaths which took place during the fraught period in contemporary Northern Ireland, called &#8216;the troubles&#8217;. The dead, far from being gone, remain as a powerful part of the community. How we think about the dead, and the stories we tell about the relationship between the dead and the living, are central to imagining new forms of community and narratives of nationhood. An intimate, yet public, monument to those killed, The Irish Linen Memorial is created on white, linen handkerchiefs, with the names printed and overstitched with embroidery, and spotted with sewn hair. As an adjunct to this counter monument, I constructed a personal installation on the subject of &#8216;mending&#8217;, developed through a residency at The Gunnery studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. In addition to The Irish Linen Memorial, in 2002 and 2004, I invited fellow artists to dialogue with the work that, in turn, produced a dance theatre performance and a seven channel sonic surround original music composition. As well, in 2005, new media components were a part of the installation. In all, this project comprises this exegesis, several gallery installations, a DVD that documents the artwork and a portfolio of images in a booklet. The exegesis outlines the complexities of a hybrid memorial grounded equally in contemporary sculpture and textiles. I have outlined the historical context of the material culture of linen and presented a general overview of the socio political landscape of contemporary Northern Ireland from a feminist postcolonial perspective. My case studies center on how installation artists tackle socio political issues of national concern. The thesis exegesis reflects upon the new theoretical positionings of feminist theory in relation to sculpture and textiles, text and textiles, feminist theories of the public and the private, the greater visibility of the migrant artist, in particular, the self consciousness of the migrant artist in Australia, together with the increasing conflation of High/Low, Art/Craft arts practice into an elastic hybridity. The case studies I examine to explore these themes are the work of USA artists Richard Serra (b. 1939) and Maya Lin (b. 1959); in particular Lin&#8217;s Vietnam Veteran&#8217;s Memorial, 1982, an anti monument on a reconciliatory theme of national importance, and Serra&#8217;s Tilted Arc, 1979 89, a courageous exposition of the working chiasmatic power of a federal, pedestrian plaza. My other case studies are contemporary artists Narelle Jubelin (Australian, currently based in Spain, b. 1960) and Doris Salcedo (Colombian, educated in New York City, b. 1958), whose installation artwork is based in sculpture and textiles, and both of whom address touch as an important component of their work. Jubelin addresses national issues through the extreme juxtaposition of petit point needlework with large scale architectonic forms. Salcedo works with art as a witness, re configuring furniture and clothing, leaving the viewer with the affect of the terror, grief and trauma of living with daily political violence. The dimensions of this book are the size of the handkerchief used in the creative project. The side bar of the exegesis acts as a reminder of the central concern of my artwork from 2001 &#8211; 2005: honouring equally all those killed in the troubles, listed chronologically. Thus, the exegesis becomes another artwork: a site, displaced and conveniently mobile, as is The Irish Linen Memorial and the book upon which it is based, Lost Lives: the stories of the men, women and children who died as a result of the troubles, 2000. The exegesis seeks to pick, unpick and rethread a sense of the fragile, recuperative work involved in a community emerging from conflict, the place of my birth.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of influence of matric suction induced by native vegetation on sub-soil improvement</field><field name="creator">Fatahi, Behzad</field><field name="description">Bioengineering including native vegetation is an ancient method of improving the stability of slopes. In modern railway engineering, this technique is re-captured for increasing the soil stiffness and shear strength of sub-grade beneath rail tracks. Currently this practice has become increasingly popular in Australia for stabilising railway corridors built over expansive clays and compressive soft soils. The tree roots provide three stabilising functions: (a) reinforcement of the soil, (b) dissipation of excess pore pressures and (c) establishing sufficient matric suction to increase the shear strength. The main focus of this research is to investigate the effects of vegetation on soil matric suction, ground settlement and lateral movement (radial consolidation). A mathematical model for the rate of root water uptake has been developed based on the root growth rate and considering ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters.The three independent features in the root water uptake model considered in detail are soil suction, root distribution, and potential transpiration. In order to establish a rigorous analysis for estimating the actual transpiration or root water uptake, the above mentioned factors have been quantified through relevant equations to develop the proposed root water uptake model. A two dimensional finite element approach based on ABAQUS has been employed to solve the transient coupled flow and deformation equations. The proposed root water uptake model has been implemented in the coupled analysis by introducing a sink term as a subroutine in the finite element analysis. The finite element mesh can be constructed using partially/fully saturated soil elements, representing the salient aspects of unsaturated permeability and the soil water characteristic curve. The model formulation is based on the general effective stress theory of unsaturated soils. Based on this proposed model, the distribution of the matric suction profile adjacent to the tree has been numerically analysed. To validate the model, an array of field  measurements conducted at Miram site in Victoria, Australia and the data have been compared with the numerical predictions. The predicted results calculated using the soil, plant, and atmospheric parameters contained in the numerical model, compared favourably with the field and the associated laboratory measurements, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed. The numerical analysis encompassing the developed root water uptake model can reasonably predict the region of maximum matric suction (away from the tree trunk axis), which has been consistent with the field measurements. Moreover, field measurements taken from the previously published literature have been compared with the numerical predictions. It is found that given the approximation of the assumed model parameters, the agreement between the predicted results and field data is still promising. The influence of different parameters on the maximum rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. In addition, the rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at wilting point, the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density have been studied in detail. The findings of this study confirm that four key parameters, including permeability, wilting point suction, density and distribution of the root length, and the rate of potential transpiration should be estimated or measured accurately in order to predict the behaviour of clayey soils near tree roots. The action of a single tree on improving the soil behaviour has been compared to a vertical drain with applied suction (vacuum pressure). It is seen that root water uptake and associated matric suction is analogous to a prefabricated vertical drain with vacuum preloading, and the lateral inward displacements simulate the radial consolidation process of prefabricated vertical drains. If a pattern of trees can be grown systematically along rail corridors, this may offer a cheaper and more environmentally attractive solution to vertical drains in the long-term. The results of this study provide a valuable and a relatively accurate mean to estimate the influences of vegetation on ground. The numerical model developed herein offers practicing geotechnical engineers an effective tool for designing structures on vadose zones containing vegetation. It is desirable to consider the influence zone of tree roots and the improved soil properties in modern geotechnical designs, benefiting from native vegetation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing the Quaternary landscape evolution and climate history of western Flores: an environmental and chronological context for an archaeological site</field><field name="creator">Westaway, Kira E</field><field name="description">The recent discovery of a late-surviving new human species, Homo floresiensis, in western Flores has accentuated our lack of understanding of the history of the genus Homo in Asia and of the environmental challenges that may have influenced these hominins. Western Flores contains a wealth of archaeological and palaeoanthropological material with far-reaching implications for human evolution and for Indonesian, Australian and world archaeology. But the interpretation of this evidence has been hindered by a limited Quaternary context and age control for complex stratigraphies in a region of great geological instability and widespread environmental change.Liang Bua in western Flores is a key site in the Indonesian archaeological record, providing evidence of cave occupation by Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens, and human evolution and dispersal on the eastern side of Wallace&#8217;s Line. In this study, archaeologically-relevant information has been gleaned from an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of this site, and has established the timing of key events, such as the first exposure of the cave and the nature of, and influences on, human occupation of the cave. This approach incorporated studies of landscape evolution, river terrace and cave development, sedimentology of cave sediments, palaeoclimate signals in speleothems, and a dating strategy utilising novel approaches to luminescence dating.The research reported here provides a chronological and environmental backdrop to the human occupation of Liang Bua. A maximum age of cave occupation is shown to correspond to the time of cave exposure (~190 ka), which also represents a minimum age for the human habitation of the area. In addition, this study has established an age range for the occupation of the cave by Homo floresiensis (95&#8211;11 ka), the time of the most intensive phases of occupation (74&#8211;61 and 17&#8211;11 ka), the depositional age of the holotype skeleton (36&#8211;14 ka), and the age of the oldest human skeletal remains found on Flores (95&#8211;74 ka). Through the integration of techniques, a framework for terrace development and landscape evolution has been developed to establish the Quaternary Westaway, setting in which the cave was formed and evolved. These techniques have also defined a sequence of geomorphological and sedimentological changes in the cave, enabling the reconstruction of the occupational environment. At least two zones of occupation have been identified: a zone established ~74&#8211;61 ka, and a later zone established ~18 ka.The environmental backdrop for the arrival and dispersal of humans throughout Indonesia has been established via a palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental analysis of speleothem records. These records contain evidence of multiple wet phases (110&#8211;98, 82&#8211;65, 49&#8211;39 and 17&#8211;5 ka) and a flourishing fauna. The timing of these wet phases correlate with evidence for channel and flowstone formation, episodic erosion events, and the most intensive periods of occupation in the cave. There is also evidence for a prolonged period of reduced rainfall (36&#8211;17 ka) in an organic-poor environment, the timing of which correlates with evidence of reduced erosion, pooling and less intense occupation. These correlations suggest that the occupational success of Homo floresiensis in this area was related to the contemporaneous environmental conditions, which, combined with the evidence for at least two volcanic events (one of which may have forced human migration), establish a link between hominids and their environment.The results of this research indicate the value of using an interdisciplinary approach to investigate and interpret archaeological sites in Southeast Asia. By providing an environmental and chronological context for important archaeological finds, we can develop a better understanding of the prehistory of Homo in Asia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing online community: core conditions to support successful development of community in Internet-mediated communities of practice.</field><field name="creator">Stuckey, Browyn E</field><field name="description">Today many groups seek to foster communities of practice in order to serve the needs of professional development, change management, quality or other professional goals. While educational agendas may be served by all communities of practice, it is not just in education that we see communities of practice (CoPs). Many long established communities can be found in sectors such as the military, government, healthcare, non profit and information technology domains. For the most part communities of practice are considered emergent entities that are often neither planned for nor orchestrated. Yet today organizations, having seen the knowledge sharing potential of CoPs, are working to purposely instigate them. Questions remain as to how an entity such as a CoP, widely recognized as organic, can be planned or designed. Many such organizations, grappling with community development, are also dealing with connecting highly distributed groups of people, not already connected by an existing shared technological infrastructure such as an intranet. With Internet technology so readily part of the work and home life, much of this recent community development also entails cultivating aspects of that community over the World Wide Web. This research set out to explore the conditions that contributed to successful community development in Internet-mediated communities of practice (IMCoPs) and how the managers or conveners of such communities might contribute to these conditions when intentionally cultivating community. A further goal was to determine whether conditions vary between IMCoPs in education and other sectors. In other words, if there were idiosyncrasies in education sector communities that should be taken into account when intentionally developing educational IMCoPs. The research was instigated by an unsuccessful attempt to foster teacher professional development by creating community in an online community space. The strengths of developing a web site to bring teachers together to engage and exchange ideas may have been understood at the outset of that task. But in hindsight, little was known about how to support this engagement and indeed the social dynamics required to sustain community over online communication. A return to the literature describing effective teacher professional development in the contemporary educational climate led to the notion of communities of practice. While understanding CoPs and their dynamics is vital, knowing how to cultivate them, for highly distributed groups of people, over Internet technologies is an essential extension for IMCoPs. To date there is sufficient literature to support the notion that community can be developed online and there is a growing body of research that suggests how to develop face-to-face CoPs. Both bodies of literature are relevant to the development of IMCoPS but neither specifically focuses on the intentional development of IMCoPs. Filling that gap became the goal of this research. This researcher chose not to focus on all aspects of the CoP rather on what is arguably the most difficult part of the IMCoP to develop online, and the nub of the earlier failure - community. There are examples of intentionally implemented IMCoPs that have been active for a number of years. Studying these would shed light on what it took to develop community in the past and whether there was a set of conditions, which when cultivated, might positively support community building. A multiple-case case study method was employed to reveal the conditions present within the early years of development of 12 successful Internet-mediated communities of practice. Data was collected from multiple sources for 12 communities and four were selected to be the heuristic communities. These communities were studied in detail in order to produce a working hypothesis or heuristic set of conditions. The cases were analyzed individually and cross-case to determine the shared conditions and their priority. The resultant set of conditions and issues was reviewed for plausibility against data collected for the remaining eight communities. The research found that there were common conditions in successful IMCoPs and presents a set of 24 categorized and prioritized conditions demonstrating various issues related to instantiations of each and the role of management in their development. The findings of this research could be used to guide redevelopment efforts for the original community and offer advice to others working to intentionally develop IMCoPs. The components do not represent a prescription for community development nor are they as the data proved uniformly relevant for IMCoPs in all sectors and circumstances. They are conditions and issues to be considered, cultivated variously and reviewed over the life of the community.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imprint of a landscape: a Yarrawa Brush story</field><field name="creator">Roby, Ruth</field><field name="description">The Yarrawa Brush landscape, situated on the Robertson Plateau just above the Illawarra escarpment, has long been a place of solace and connectedness for me, documented over the years through intensely worked etchings.

Using post-colonial theory, it demonstrates how Orientalist discourse has maintained its cultural hegemony by cutting across a range of genres in the field of travel texts and changing over time. The first part of the study, situated in early nineteenth-century England and India, traces the emergence of the guidebook from the genre of the travel narrative, examining shaping influences, such as the exhibition and museum, and the aesthetic of the picturesque. Through a textual analysis of early guidebooks to India published by John Murray and Thomas Cook, it shows how the guidebook, through the discourses of science and commodification, produced a more systematic form of Orientalist discourse than the travel narrative by constructing the Other as commodified spectacle. The second half of the thesis follows the development of Orientalist discourse in travel guidebooks over time to demonstrate how, within the relations of contemporary global tourism, it is becoming increasingly hegemonic. The study compares Lonely Planet India, a contemporary guidebook published by the popular travel publisher known as the Lonely Planet, to the guidebooks published by John Murray and Thomas Cook, showing how the Other is commodified within the relations of postmodernism. As a result of heightened aestheticization, the blurring of genres, and innovations in global digital technology, the printed guidebook has become part of a matrix of digital and print productions that constructs an increasingly interlocking economy of Orientalist travel discourse. This consolidates the Orientalism of the earlier guidebooks, commodifying the Other into a hyperreal spectacle that functions as a site of spiritual transformation for the Western tourist as it reinscribes the colonial project through a rehearsal of imperial nostalgia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the challenges of sustainable and effective professional development for English as second language teachers in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Gajadeera, Sudharma Rohini</field><field name="description">This study explores challenges of sustainable and effective professional development for English as Second Language (ESL) teachers in Sri Lanka. It aims to critically examine how the existing English teacher education system as a whole responds to the wider context of the crisis of sustainability in the quality of teaching and learning. It further aims to investigate perceptions of various stakeholders regarding issues, concerns and constraints of ESL teachers in order to explore approaches, strategies and changes needed to enhance effective and sustainable English teacher education within the system. In order to capture the complexity of the education system as a whole, &#8216;Systems Thinking&#8217; paradigm has been adopted. It views the organizational behaviour and its respective environment as a complex whole of interrelating, interdependent parts rather than fragmented entities, which go beyond simple cause and effect relationships. A qualitative research approach has been used to investigate the experiences, opinions, presuppositions, and interpretations of stakeholders in this complex context. The multiple case studies conducted via fifty-seven informants represent the whole education system namely at the higher, middle and classroom management levels. The methods of data collection encompass focus groups, semi structured interviews and analysis of documents. Six key themes emerged from the analysis of data, namely policy and reforms; administration and management; implementation; structure; curriculum development; and working environment and resources. The research findings reveal the necessity for well-documented policies for English teacher education and the need for systemic management and administration with a shared vision, collaboration and personal mastery to establish tri-level development and effective networks. The lack of sufficient resources is found to be a key challenge in promoting sustainable and effective professional development practices island-wide. These findings are also the bases for recommendations and further research to cater for the socio-economic-political and global demands of post-colonial Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation in the reconstruction, with counsellors, of beliefs that clients hold about their sexual assault experiences: a personal construct model</field><field name="creator">Carter, Carole Elizabeth</field><field name="description">People who have been sexually assaulted or abused will later be influenced not so much by the event itself but by their interpretations of it. This research proposed that when clients disclose their experiences of sexual assault to a counsellor, the resulting validation or invalidation of different foci of their beliefs about the assault and about themselves will affect the likelihood of their beginning to reconstruct their unhelpful beliefs about their experiences, and to move in the direction of optimal functioning. Forty-one participants were interviewed about their experiences of disclosing sexual assault to a counsellor. A personal construct model was developed to account for the role of validation in clients reconstructions of their unhelpful beliefs arising from their sexual assault experiences, and was tested using both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The findings did not wholly support the proposed model. As predicted, invalidation of clients beliefs about their assault experiences, and validation of their meaning-making processes, were found to be integral to enhancing reconstruction of their beliefs. One foci of the model was not upheld. Contrary to the prediction, invalidation of clients beliefs about themselves was found to be more likely to lead to reconstruction than validation of their beliefs about themselves. The personal construct model was revised in the light of these findings. The limitations of the research, suggestions for future research, the usefulness of the personal construct model and the Validation and Reconstruction Assessment Techniques devised to test it, and the clinical implications of the research, are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Yao, Yueping (Jane)</field><field name="description">A systematic investigation of carbon based anode materials has been made in this Master&#65533;s thesis project. The physical, structural and electrochemical properties of these anode materials have been characterized by a variety of techniques. A literature review summarizes the principles of lithium-ion battery operation, cathode materials, anode materials and electrolytes. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, using nanocrystalline iron powders as the catalyst. The diameter of the as-prepared MWNTs is about 20-50nm. Electrochemical testing shows that the MWNT electrodes had a reversible lithium storage capacity of 340-350mAh/g. The kinetics of Li-ion insertion in carbon nanotube electrodes were characterized by a.c. impedance measurements. The electrochemical properties of graphitized mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode materials were studied. SEM observation shows that MCMB agglomerates have a spherical shape with an average particle size of 13?m. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated a pair of redox peaks, corresponding to lithium insertion and extraction in the MCMB structure. MCMB anodes delivered a reversible capacity of ~325mAh/g with good cyclability. In order to improve the capacity of bare graphite, Sn-coated graphite composites were prepared by using electroless deposition. Cyclic voltammograms show additional redox reaction peaks, which are related to the reaction of Sn with lithium. Sn-graphite composites demonstrated a much higher lithium storage capacity than the bare graphite electrode. Since MCMB anode materials are very stable for lithium-ion insertion and extraction, Sn-coated MCMB composites were developed by combining the high lithium storage, elemental Sn and MCMB to obtain stable cyclability. The Sn-MCMB electrodes show improved capacity and good cyclability within a 15wt% loading of Sn.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-resident cinema: transnational audiences for Indian films</field><field name="creator">Athique, Adrian Mabbott</field><field name="description">In this thesis the popular Indian film is described as an object of global significance. It is argued that understanding Indian films on a global scale requires different governing structures to existing paradigms of national media research and that, in particular, this requires a focus upon the consumption, rather than the production, of cinema. This thesis will also argue that the Australian media environment is constituted by a complex matrix of transnational cultural flows that spread beyond the boundaries of nationalist discourse, and that understanding the social dynamics of cinema in Australia requires an intellectual engagement with the phenomenon of globalisation.This thesis seeks to locate the cultural geography of Indian films in a global context before presenting a local case study that draws on a body of interviews and survey exercises conducted during 2003-04 with film-viewers and media professionals in the Greater Sydney and Illawarra regions of New South Wales, Australia. My immediate concern is with the manner in which Indian movies reach an audience within this social environment and how that audience is described, both by themselves and by those who seek to cater to them. Thus, a further intention of this study overall is to conduct a reevaluation of the nature of the social imagination which has been assumed to operate around participation in communities defined by media use. This study therefore combines three major points of enquiry: Indian films as globally dispersed media artefacts, Australia as a site of complex transnational cultural practices, and media audiences as sites of relational social imagination. The theoretical framework that I advance here reformulates the conception of media audiences as &#8216;imagined communities&#8217; by replacing a demographically constituted ethnographic model with an emphasis on surveying the diverse inhabitants of a &#8216;cultural field&#8217; constructed around the Indian movie in a specific Australian social context.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of anode materials for lithium-ion batteries|</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Ling</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to investigate various novel anodes for the lithium ion secondary battery. Lithium ion batteries are currently the best portable energy storage devices for the consumer electronics market. Large capacity, good cyclability, and no reaction with electrolytes are indispensable haracteristics for lithium ion battery anodes. The recent development of lithium ion batteries has been achieved by the use of selected carbon and graphite materials as anode. Therefore, carbon based materials have been the main candidates for commercial use. However, many efforts have been aimed at finding potential substitutes for carbon based materials.Tin oxide has been a popular candidate material for lithium ion battery anodes since it was discovered. In this study, it was prepared by an in-situ spray pyrolysis technique, and the electrochemical properties were examined in detail. The resultant spherical porous SnO2 anode shows superior electrochemical properties, i.e. a large initial capacity (601 mAh/g) and excellent cyclability. The retained capacity up to 50 cycles is 68.2% of the initial capacity, which is far superior to any previous SnO2 electrode. To avoid the capacity fading after the first discharge, carbon or polymer polypyrrole were added to produce tin oxide based nanocomposite materials as described in the following chapters. Improved reversible capacity performance was achieved by using these approaches. The SnO2-carbon composites showed a significantly improved cycle-life performance compared with SnO2 without carbon. The conductive polypyrrole also serves as a conducting matrix to buffer the active material in the composite and thus to reduce the volume change associated with LixSn alloying and dealloying reactions. The cyclability was improved compared to bare SnO2 anodes.Some transition metal oxides also show excellent potential for lithium ion batteries. Nanostructured cobalt, or nickel oxide composites are promising substitutes for graphite anodes. Therefore, they were synthesized by different novel methods in this study, and their electrochemical properties for lithium ion batteries were explored systematically. Electrochemical measurements showed that the NiO nanoshaft cluster electrodes could be charged and discharged reversibly with high capacities and superior cycling reversibility. The as-prepared Co3O4 also demonstrates high lithium storage capacity and promising cycle-life as an electrode material for Li-ion batteries.Furthermore, mesoporous gold sponges were employed as anode materials for the lithium ion battery for the first time. The multilayer mesoporous Au electrode showed superior discharge capacities and better cycling stability than thin, solid gold film. The mesoporous structure of the Au probably contributes to accommodating the large volume changes in the electrode that occur during alloying and dealloying, which can reduce the fading in capacity to some extent. Therefore, all of these novel anode materials are unique and good substitutes for traditional carbonaceous anodes for lithium ion batteries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures under terahertz radiation</field><field name="creator">Pilehrood, Saeid Hessami</field><field name="description">The dynamic conductivity and electromagnetic (EM) absorption of a two dimensional electron-photon system are formulated via calculating the exact time-dependent electronic states and the density matrix of the electron-photon system with its contribution to the electrical current, including electron-THz-photon interaction to all orders.

Using the concepts of modularity, boundary objects, and articulation, I demonstrate that these relationships are structured in a modular fashion. How knowledge is used, reused, and valued in an alliance is dependent upon the structure of that alliance. Knowledge is seen to exist in two forms &#8211; migratory, being mobile and combinable, and ingrained, being personally idiosyncratic and intertwined with specialization. In examining these forms of knowledge and the way that they are used by members of a collaboration, I use an interpretive methodology to analyze the data derived from four case studies of university-industry collaboration. One case study is based on an alliance in the United States and the other three cases present evidence from collaborations in Australia. I explore the appropriateness of applying the concepts of modular design to interorganizational collaborations, the production and use of knowledge within the boundaries of these structural arrangements, and the role of the university and firm scientists in the endeavour to develop therapeutics through the application of biotechnology. I argue that the movement of knowledge is dependent upon the structure through which knowledge processes are operationalized. In addition, I submit that knowledge based collaborations in biotechnology must be analyzed with respect to the larger contextual framework of the biopharmaceutical industry, with consideration of both the competitors of an alliance and the ill patients who stand to benefit from the work within an alliance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of the role of Australian customs in maritime surveillance and border protection.</field><field name="creator">Bannon, Matthew</field><field name="description">Customs maritime surveillance history has been influenced by numerous reports that often identified the need for management changes or infrastructure changes. This thesis analyses the evolution of the Australian Customs Services' role in Australia's maritime surveillance and border protection. The analysis framework is built around policy, financial and legal influences and developments. The thesis recommends implementing a comprehensive harmonized strategy for early detection and effective responses. This thesis argues that there are only two organisations capable of sustaining an effective maritime surveillance and enforcement capacity and they are the Australian Customs Service (Customs) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The suggestion that a single Australian coastguard organisation is another option is analysed in this thesis and discounted. The thesis looks at Customs evolution in maritime surveillance and border protection from pre-Federation to mid 2005 and forecasts some alternatives that could advance maritime surveillance and protection policy. This thesis is important because competing world priorities, including terrorism versus trade, in turn, can lead to rapid policy competition for government funding, which can lead to poor policy choices.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of water recycling technologies</field><field name="creator">Al-rifai, Jawad Hilmi</field><field name="description">Prolonged drought conditions and increased water consumption, especially in Australia, have forced water authorities, consumers and local councils to consider wastewater recycling as a supplementary water supply. As a consequence there is a growing momentum favouring reuse of wastewater. Due to a fear of the potential effects of micro-pollutants on wildlife and human health, there has been a concomitant increase in resistance to such schemes. Three Australian wastewater recycling schemes have been studied for their ability to remove trace organic contaminants. Two of these schemes employ reverse osmosis (RO) technology and the other applies ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration (BAC). Contaminant concentrations were determined using a sensitive analytical method, developed in this study, comprising solid phase extraction (SPE), derivatization and gas chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometry detector (MS) using selected ion monitoring (SIM). In addition, a range of other standard characterization techniques including total organic carbon, total nitrogen, turbidity, UV absorbance and pH were used. In raw wastewaters, analgesics and non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications present were similar in nature and concentration to those found in wastewaters around the world. Remarkably, removal efficiencies for the three schemes were superior to literature values and RO was responsible for the greatest proportion of contaminant removal. A comprehensive one year study was conducted to investigate the occurrence, persistence and fate of a range of organic compounds at different processing points at the Luggage Point Water Reclamation Plant in Brisbane, Australia. The treatment applied consists of screening, grit removal and diffused activated sludge followed by microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO). It was found that salicylic acid was the most abundant contaminant in the influent with a concentration range of 11,065 - 38,490 ng/L followed by bisphenol A with a range of 6,330 - 23,020 ng/L. The concentration of all analytes decreased on average by one order of magnitude during primary and secondary treatments. Gemfibrozil, primidone and carbamazepine were found to have relatively low removal efficiencies (74-78%) during these stages compared to the other compounds which would indicate lower biodegradability. Furthermore, a positive relation was found between metal concentration and their removal from the wastewater treatment plant resulting in a concentration less than 0.05 mg/Lfor most metals in the secondary effluent. The RO system was found to play an important role in further lowering these concentrations by another order of magnitude. The overall removal efficiencies in the final recycled water were between of 97-100% resulting in most compound concentrations in the product water being lower than 100ng/L. An exception to this was bisphenol A (which was present at concentrations of up to 500 ng/L). Notably, the RO membrane serves as a large reservoir for organic matter (i.e., high organic carbon, TN and absorbance measurements) as well as trace organic compounds such as PhACs and EDCs due to the adsorption of contaminants on membranes and their likely release in the brine. The concentrations of trace organic compounds reached &#956;g/L levels. The concentration factor for the detected compounds ranged between one and five for all detected trace compounds. With regard to the metals content of the brine (anions, cations and heavy metals), the RO membrane concentrates these metals by a factor of between three and five. The demonstrated ability of RO membranes to concentrate many of the compounds highlights the need for continued research into monitoring wastewater treatment, concentrate disposal, improved water recycling schemes and ultimately, safer water and a cleaner environment. Fully investigation of the micropollutants fate in the wastewater treatement plants was impossible due to both time constraints and the fact that little systematic relationships were found between the removal of organic contaminants and water treatment processes. It was not possible to pursue studies of the mechanisms of removal for the treatment plants under investigation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanostructured materials for electrodes in lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Ng, See How</field><field name="description">The commercially available lithium-ion cells, which are the most advanced among the rechargeable battery systems available so far, employ polycrystalline microsized powder as the electrode materials, which functions as the Li-ion insertion hosts. With the advancement of nanotechnology, there is an interest in the replacement of conventional materials by nanostructured materials. The use of nanoparticles in composite electrodes for Li-ion batteries may have considerable kinetic advantages due to the reduction of the diffusion length for lithium-ion insertion into the active mass, and also because of the reduction of the overall charge transfer resistance of the electrodes. In this doctoral work, several nanostructured materials were examined and characterized for possible application as electrode materials in Li-ion rechargeable batteries. Among the anode candidates studied were free-standing single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) paper, lead oxide (PbO) and lead oxide-carbon (PbO-C) nanocomposite, and carbon-coated silicon (Si-C) nanocomposite materials. Meanwhile, several cathode candidates were also studied: nanostructured vanadium oxide (V2O5), lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8) nanoparticles, and lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) thin film electrode.Free-standing SWCNT paper electrodes have been synthesized by a simple filtration method via positive pressure. The free-standing electrode was produced without any binder or metal substrate, which reduced the weight significantly. The free-standing SWCNT paper electrodes were also flexible and had good electrical conductivity. With the addition of both carbon black and nanosized Si particles, the electrical conductivity and specific capacity of the free-standing SWCNT paper electrode were greatly enhanced, so that they retained a capacity of 400 mAh g-1 beyond 100 cycles. A new approach has been used to prepare nanostructured PbO and PbO-C composites via the spray pyrolysis technique. The prepared powders consist of fine nanocrystalline PbO homogeneously distributed within an amorphous carbon matrix with highly developed surface area. The combination of spray technology and carbon addition increased the specific surface area (above 6 m2 g-1) and the conductivity of PbO, and also improved the specific capacity, with a reversible capacity above 100 mAh g-1 retained beyond 50 cycles. An effective, inexpensive, and industrially oriented approach was applied to produce carbon-coated Si nanocomposites. Carbon-coated Si nanocomposites spraypyrolyzed in air at 400 oC showed the best cycling performance, retaining a specific capacity of 1120 mAh g-1 beyond 100 cycles, with a capacity fading of less than 0.4 % per cycle. The beneficial effect of the carbon-coating in enhancing the dimensional stability of the Si nanoparticles appears to be the main reason for this markedly improved electrochemical performance.One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of V2O5 have been successfully synthesized via a precipitation process followed by heating in vacuum at 300 oC. The increase in crystallinity and higher yield of one-dimensional nanostructured oxides contributed significantly to the improved capacity and enhanced cycle life. V2O5 nanoparticles were also synthesized via the flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process in air. They showed an improved cycle life when the cut-off potential for discharging was increased from 1.5 Vto 2.5 V. The significant capacity loss when discharging to 1.5 V is possibly related to the dissolution of vanadium active mass and the structural changes upon cycling in the larger potential span. The flame spray pyrolyzed V2O5 nanoparticles show excellent cyclability when cycled between 2.5 V and 4.0 V vs. Li/Li+, retaining a discharge capacity of 120 mAh g-1 beyond 100 cycles at a cycling rate of 100 mA g-1. LiV3O8 nanoparticles (~24 nm in size) have been synthesized by FSP for the first time. The assynthesized LiV3O8 nanoparticles proved to be a promising cathode material for lithium rechargeable batteries, retaining a specific discharge capacity of 180 mAh g-1 beyond 50 cycles. A series of LiMn2O4 thin films on either Si (100) or stainless steel substrate were successfully prepared via pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The as-deposited LiMn2O4 thin films on stainless steel substrate are highly lithium- and oxygen-deficient, as confirmed by ERDA/RBS and Raman analysis. Lithium and oxygen content increased when the pulse rate was increased, leading to thicker films. However, the LiMn2O4 thin film with the lowest deposition pulse rate (or thinnest film) exhibited the best electrochemical performance, retaining a charge capacity of 48 &#956;Ah cm-2 &#956;m-1 beyond 100 cycles.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of lithic artefact microdebitage for chronological determination of archaeological sites</field><field name="creator">Susino, George J.</field><field name="description">This study explores the use of several different techniques to isolate and determine the age of lithic microdebitage in relation to archaeological deposits and associated sediments. Quartz microdebitage was identified on the basis of surface features and roundness index by applying scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) and optical stereomicroscopy to archaeologically relevant sediments. Characteristics of the quartz microdebitage were compared with quartz grains from the same sedimentary layer. The observation of diagnostic features on quartz grains made it possible to discriminate between microdebitage and sedimentary background.This investigation has established that microdebitage particles under 500 &#956;m diameter are not easily resolved under optical stereomicroscopy, requiring the aid of SEM to discern between microdebitage and sedimentary quartz. It was also ascertained that no adverse effects on the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal are measurable after exposure to SEM, provided that the electron beam is kept at, or under, 10 keV.Sedimentary material previously excavated from the Jinmium rockshelter (Northern Territory) and Mushroom Rock West (Queensland) was used to determine the age of quartz microdebitage from the archaeological layers by applying the OSL dating technique. The microdebitage OSL signal behaves similarly to that of sedimentary quartz grains, and is subject to the same problems. The OSL single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol (SAR) was successfully applied to the age determination of microdebitage. The modifications used for the dose rate (due to particle size and shape) and for the calibration of the beta source (due to particle size) did not produce any inconsistencies or anomalous results. In the investigation of two archaeologically relevant sediment layers from the Jinmium rockshelter deposit, the minimum OSL age at 68 cm depth for the microdebitage was estimated as 4100 &#177; 900 years (12,600 &#177; 4000 years using the central age model estimate, with 73% over-dispersion on the palaeodose), and, for the sedimentary material, a central age model of 5300 &#177; 800 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 1900 &#177; 400 years, and, 78% over-dispersion). At 115 cm in the deposit, the OSL central age model estimate for the microdebitage is 10,200 &#177; 1100 years, with a minimum age model of 4500 &#177; 600 years (and an overiv dispersion of 56%). In the case study of Mushroom Rock West rockshelter, the OSL central age model estimate for microdebitage at 268 cm depth into the archaeological deposit is 21,200 &#177; 3100 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 10,500 &#177; 5200 years, and 60% over-dispersion), compared to a central age model estimate for the sedimentary quartz grains of 31,500 &#177; 3100 years (with a minimum age model estimate of 11,100 &#177; 1500 years, and 67% over-dispersion). For the archaeological layer situated at 441 cm depth, the microdebitage yielded an OSL age of 27,400 &#177; 2200 years. This sample of microdebitage produced the lowest over-dispersion (0.1%) on the palaeodose of any of the samples analysed, lending confidence to the accuracy of the palaeodose determination. The sedimentary quartz from the same sample produced an OSL minimum age model estimate of 33,500 &#177; 5600 years (and a central age model estimate of 46,900 &#177;3400 years). Relationships between microdebitage and sediment OSL ages are discussed.Direct OSL dating of the unheated quartz derived from the manufacture of lithic tools now provides an alternative to the reliance on sedimentary quartz as the primary source information regarding the age of archaeological deposits. This knowledge may be applied also to archaeological sediments previously excavated, for identifying episodes of lithic manufacture in temporal relation to other evidence of cultural activity. The ages of the two archaeological sites analysed differ widely, and this difference was also represented in the ages obtained from the microdebitage. None of the OSL age determinations of microdebitage was found to be unrealistically outside the boundaries of pre-existing age control. This is one indication of the validity of the novel experimental approach applied here.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weighing the risks: individualisation, trust and risk in three lead contaminated communites in Australia</field><field name="creator">Condon-Paoloni, Deanne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores residents&#8217; accounts of their experience of dealing with living in an environment that has been designated as potentially hazardous because of lead contamination, and which potentially placed them, but especially their children, in the category &#8216;at risk&#8217;. This qualitative study investigated how people come to decisions about health risks in the environment and how they evaluate these within a community and family context. The study was carried out in three Australian communities identified as contaminated by lead, Port Pirie, Broken Hill and Port Kembla, that have varying degrees of lead contamination and different levels of programs dealing with lead abatement, providing the opportunity for a comparative analysis of responses to risk in relation to exposure and abatement.Lead in the environment is potentially an emotive issue, since its effects are most significant in a vulnerable group, preschool aged children. There also has been significant scientific and policy debate about what constitutes a hazardous level of lead in blood, and there has been a constant downward revision of &#8216;safe&#8217; blood lead levels. Lead contamination therefore provides an excellent case study to explore community responses to expert risk assessment.The study used the &#8216;risk society&#8217; macro-theory of Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens, especially their development of the concepts of risk, reflexivity, individualization and trust, as a framework for understanding residents&#8217; responses at the micro-level in the community.Findings showed that risk has become normalised and globalised, so that risk from lead is just one risk among many that participants in the study saw as routine in their everyday lives. The study also showed the importance of the individualisation of many aspects of contemporary life. Participants, as parents, saw themselves as individually responsible for life planning, for managing their children&#8217;s paths through life until they were old enough to take on the role, and health planning was one part of this, a project in which all members of society were engaged. This individualisation of all aspects of life and health, resulted in a redefinition of environmental risk as a lifestyle risk that moved responsibility for its management away from government and health agencies onto the individual.One part of the normalisation and globalisation of risk was related to the dependence on abstract expert systems, such as the health system or agencies involved in environmental monitoring. The thesis shows the importance of trust in relation to risk, in the relationship between the institutions responsible for promoting the health of the population, and especially the importance of the mechanisms by which trust is established and maintained. Finally, it is argued that risk was not so much acceptable as weighed in the balance, so that residents balanced individualised management of risk against living in the community, social relations, employment and other aspects of social life.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abandoning the masculine domain of leadership to identify a new space for women's being, valuing and doing</field><field name="creator">Rodgers-Healey, Diann M</field><field name="description">Women continue to experience a range of barriers in the domain of leadership and have not as yet achieved equality or equity. An empirical and non-empirical literature review showed that the historic evolution of leadership theory and the practice of leadership are male dominated and masculinist with contemporary leadership bearing vestiges of gender prejudice creating systemic inequities for women.  Where research has been carried out into the area of women and leadership, this has consisted of exploring the barriers which women experience at all levels of organisations, how these barriers can be overcome and the effectiveness of women&#8217;s leadership style. However, this has invariably remained within the boundaries of masculinist leadership and has not resulted in achieving relative change for women even though strategies such as diversity and legislation to eradicate inequities against women in the workplace are being pursued.With the intent of capturing multiple realities of women and men who advocate for women&#8217;s empowerment, in relation to how they perceive and experience the phenomenon of leadership and explore what is possible for women, beyond the masculinist boundaries of leadership, this study using a constructivist, phenomenological, feminist and grounded theory approach invited ten Australian women leaders of different age and background and from different workplaces to abandon the arena of leadership to conceptually explore what lies outside it in terms of women&#8217;s being, valuing and doing. A grounded theory analysis of the findings of phase 1 interviews resulted in the model of co-existence and 20 principles which applied to a co-existential way of being for women and men. A corollary model of patriarchy explicating the forces that underpin contemporary society and opposing the development of co-existence also emerged.  The model of co-existence was refined in phase 2 when a grounded theory analysis of in-depth interviews with seven Australian women leaders and three Australian men leaders led to the development of an implementation plan for the model of co-existence in new and established organisations.  Surpassing contemporary diversity initiatives, the model moves beyond masculinism, feminism, and patriarchy, redefining leadership and shifting the focus from the inequitable disparity between the sexes to self-fulfilment for each person.  It is expected that further research of the model of co-existence in organisations will lead to additional refinement and validation as well as the creation of a discourse about co-existence and its potential to transform work and how we live.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous diasporic literature : representations of the Shaman in the works of Sam Watson and Alootook Ipellie</field><field name="creator">McMahon-Coleman, Kimberley</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to bring together postcolonial and diaspora theories to look at the work of two Indigenous writers. It explores how complexities of postcolonial representation may be analysed by viewing Indigenous populations in Canada and Australia as members of intra-national diasporas, with the mission sites being fashioned as diaspora spaces. The figures that populate these spaces are never quite at home in their host communities, and are also unable to return completely to the homelands of their imaginations. This thesis argues that the defining features of Indigenous diasporic literature are the creation of maban realism and queer figures. Indigenous diasporic texts feature supernatural events and characters, are strongly political, and force mainstream readers into unfamiliar reading positions. The two texts examined here, Alootook Ipellie&#8217;s Arctic Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Watson&#8217;s The Kadaitcha Sung, achieve this through the use of shamanic protagonists. Each author&#8217;s work conforms to a mainstream readership&#8217;s expectations in terms of the type of narrative told, yet the texts queer many literary conventions. Ipellie&#8217;s stories return to the stereotype of, in his words, the &#8220;quaint Eskimo,&#8221; whilst Watson&#8217;s is, at heart, a Stolen Generations narrative. Perhaps ironically, each writer has used an established narrative which is the antithesis of his own lived experience, suggesting that even as he sought to carve out a space and a means of telling Indigenous stories that may have otherwise remained untold, that space was still being delineated by colonial history. In these works, the shaman is an Indigenous diasporic voice&#8212;a way of telling Indigenous stories in difficult political environments. The Indigenous diasporic framework provides a means of analysing such stories, which utilise imagery from two conflicting cultures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's regulation of commercial use of wildlife: an absence of eco-logic</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Linda L</field><field name="description">Environmental law responds to a vast array of stakeholders at both the domestic and international level. Where it relates to the often controversial area of the regulation of commercial trade in wildlife, the law is subject to the push and pull of different views about what is &#8216;acceptable&#8217; use. Given that these views can be diametrically opposed, depending on the stakeholder or society, the regulation of wildlife trade provides a compelling example of the way philosophical, cultural, political and economic, as well as ecological, concerns find their way into the hearts and minds of legal decision makers. This thesis draws on the international experience concerning commercial use of wildlife but its focus is the approach of Australia&#8217;s federal legislature to regulation of the trade. The purpose of my research is to show that significant developments in international environmental law, leading to more widespread acknowledgement of the potential conservation benefits of commercial use of wildlife, have not infiltrated the Australian wildlife regime. I demonstrate this by a focus on what I consider are illogical constraints on Australia&#8217;s commercial use of wildlife. Initially environmental law met commercial use of wildlife head on with strict prohibitions on trade. This approach has evolved significantly to the extent that it is now widely accepted that commercial consumptive use of wildlife is a potential conservation tool. The bulk of the world&#8217;s remaining wildlife exists in developing countries and a prohibitionist approach, often imposed from afar, does not necessarily engage with the cultural, economic and ecological interests of those rural and remote communities in closest proximity to wildlife. Protection has therefore been recharacterised as simply another tool alongside conservation via sustainable use (&#8216;CSU&#8217;). This acknowledges that environmental management occurs within a world of use and where the greatest threat to wildlife is the loss of habitat such that conservation must compete with financially lucrative but highly destructive uses of the environment. In this context, sustainable use may provide an incentive that competes with more destructive alternative uses. iv To illustrate that environmental law may be a social, cultural and political construct as much as it is a response to conservation imperatives, my analysis required examination of a range of influences on the design and implementation of the Australian regime. The thesis begins by working through contributions from conservation biology, philosophy, cultural and political critiques, empirical studies and international and domestic policy documents. These chapters then provide the groundwork for the legal critique which comprises an examination of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (&#8216;CITES&#8217;) and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)(&#8216;EPBC Act&#8217;). The evolution in the international debate is reflected in the implementation of CITES which has moved from a protectionist regime, concerned with &#8216;threats&#8217; from trade, towards greater accommodation of the CSU approach. The Australian regime has not responded to these developments, however, and the EPBC Act&#8217;s wildlife trade provisions &#8211; which came into force in 2001 &#8211; have hardly deviated from the legislation they replaced, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 (Cth). I then demonstrate both the protectionist focus and the selectivity of the Australian regime by way of an examination of the Commonwealth&#8217;s approach to live commercial exports of native animals and the international movement of hunting trophies. For decades there has been a prohibition on the commercial export of live terrestrial vertebrates, in the face of ongoing calls to allow, at least on a trial basis, the export of native birds and reptiles for the international pet trade. Successive federal governments have refused to budge on this issue, despite the fact that: i. native Australian animals, particularly birds, have already made their way into the international trade, as bred and exported by other countries; ii. Australia at the same time allows the live commercial export of other native fauna, particularly lobsters but also insect and aquatic pets; and iii. there is a thriving domestic trade in live birds and reptiles between Australia&#8217;s states and territories. The second case study, on the federal prohibitionist approach to international movement of hunting trophies, is even more at odds with international conservation thinking. Sport v or safari hunting may present as an unacceptable use of wildlife to many in Australian society yet it is highly lucrative and has been embraced in many countries by those marginal rural communities which manage species attractive to sports hunters. It is also proposed as a viable industry for remote indigenous communities in Australia. The case studies show that the prohibitionist approach is clearly favoured in Australia as the most politically acceptable as no effort has been made to explain or justify the legislative and policy inconsistencies. Proponents of greater use of wildlife, however, have significant hurdles to overcome, not least an application of the precautionary principle that does not sit easily with the concept of relative threats to biodiversity, which is the basis of CSU. The thesis concludes that the influence of non-ecological imperatives have held sway, given the arbitrary divide in protective measures for wildlife that conflicts with not only significant international policy and commentary but the findings of every Australian parliamentary inquiry into the issue. A potential conservation tool for Australia, particularly its more marginal landscapes, is being sidelined by the reluctance of decision makers to engage with commercial use of wildlife in a robust manner. I wish to emphasise, however, that whether CSU could be a positive player in Australian environmental management is not the primary concern of the thesis; my focus is on how environmental legislation can be subject to forces that have no apparent grounding in conservation concerns.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of mind, out of sight: government policy on migrants' mental health, Australia 1960-2000</field><field name="creator">Wickramasinghe, Tilaka</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the health policies and services developed and delivered by Commonwealth and New South Wales governments for migrants during the period 1960 to 2000. While the thesis discusses migrant health policies in general, it principally examines mental health policies and services for migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB). It has selected the Illawarra region of New South Wales as the area for its case study. Mental health has traditionally been the responsibility of state and territory governments with little assistance from the Commonwealth. Despite growing evidence of serious mental health problems in the migrant communities, governments were slow to recognise the need to resolve them. The mental health of migrants became a serious issue during the post- World War Two period of migrant intake. From that era until the seventies the ideology of assimilation dominated Australian health and welfare policies and services, hence, migrant health did not receive special attention. With the introduction of multiculturalism, migrant services improved, partly as a response to the efforts of migrant communities themselves. But it has not been sufficient. The Illawarra region of New South Wales has been an area which has benefited very little from NSW health department policies. Yet, it is one of the state's regions which is home to a significant NESB migrant population. It is also a region with high levels of unemployment. The NESB population is culturally, linguistically and socio-economically disadvantaged. Mental illness, in such circumstances is an insurmountable problem which has not received due recognition. In a society which discriminates against the mentally ill, mentally ill migrants suffer a double disadvantage due to their migrantness and their 'madness'. If over three decades of multicultural philosophies have brought Australia cultural pluralism, it is not reflected in migrant health and welfare. The problems remain, clouded by the haze of multiculturalism. Mental health policies and services for NESB migrants remain inadequate to the present day. The distribution of services is discriminatory towards the Illawarra region. Current problems in the delivery of services to migrants are inherited from a monolinguistic and monocultural past exacerbated by ethnocentric practices and attitudes of Ausralian governments and society.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration without boundaries: virtual voyages into virtual landscapes</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Hilary Frances</field><field name="description">Exploration Without Boundaries is a visual digital media exploration reflecting industrial, technological and environmental change over time. It comprises an interactive CD ROM, a book, and a gallery installation. Exploration Without Boundaries is distinctive in that it describes natural and imagined worlds in the virtual domain with materials described entirely by means of algorithms and fractals, rather than from photographic textures. This document is an exegesis that assists the viewer in understanding the complexities of Exploration Without Boundaries and to place it in an historical and social context. It addresses aspects of particular theories and issues pertinent to the work, for instance aesthetics, fine art, mathematics and cultural studies. I consider aspects of utopian and dystopian environments in the historical context of virtual reality, its technology and literature. Importantly I consider the relationship of the real and virtual worlds, and provide an overview of Land Art, an influential art movement of the 1970s, by comparing the creation of spatial constructs in the real world with generating land forms in the virtual world, and place Exploration Without Boundaries in the context of art work in the landscape. In particular, I present two case studies of noted Land Art artists, Robert Smithson (1938-1973 US) and Richard Long (b. 1945 UK). Navigation, mapping and orientation are all important concepts in Exploration Without Boundaries, therefore I provide information concerning topographic and diagrammatic mapping as they relate to computer games and environments. Also I compare the environments of Exploration Without Boundaries with those of two other inter active CD ROMs: Eve (1996) by Peter Gabriel, (b. 1950 UK) and Puppet Motel (1995) by Laurie Anderson (b. 1947 US). Neither the process nor the production of Exploration Without Boundaries can be separated from its technological origins, therefore I discuss work done by Benoit Mandelbrot (b. 1924 Warsaw, now resident in USA), Kenton Musgrave (b. 1955, USA) and Eric Wenger, (b. 1960 France, now resident in USA) in developing the tools for synthesising mathematically described textures. In an autobiographical context, I examine some of the historical and theoretical aesthetics underlying Exploration Without Boundaries, and describe the landscape as seen from an ironic post-modern view of the colonial perspective. Finally, I provide a description of the content of both the gallery installation and the interactive CD ROM and the structure and symbolism of Exploration Without Boundaries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Star formation and internal kinematics of irregular galaxies</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Vincent</field><field name="description">I present a detailed study of two Magellanic Irregular galaxies, NGC 4214 and NGC 1156. With relatively high star formation rates and plenty of neutral gas, they are interesting laboratories in which to study the organisational processes that lead to star formation. These galaxies have masses in the ransition region between dwarf irregular and spiral galaxies, and are close analogues of the Large Magellanic Cloud, so it is of interest make detailed observations for later comparative studies. The neutral Hydrogen observations are the highest angular resolution available to date for these galaxies (~ 800 FWHM), with fine velocity resolution (1.3 km.s&#8254;&#185;). These show remarkable structure in both objects, including large holes and small clouds of gas (~ 107 M&#64321;) with moderate velocity offsets from the general rotation. An large, incompletely evacuated hole (2.2 kpc diameter) dominates the western half of NGC 1156. Its origin is unclear. The velocity fields of both galaxies show most of the disk is rotating smoothly, but near the centre appear to have significant noncircular motions, probably induced by a stellar bar. &#201;chelle spectroscopy at H&#945; shows the HII regions are following the same orbits as the neutral gas. The galaxies' optical structure and stellar populations are characterised through multicolour imaging, H&#945;  emission-line imaging and densely-spaced longslit spectra. NGC 4214 exhibits two exponential components in its surface brightness profile, while NGC 1156 is consistent with a single exponential. In both objects the major axis of the bright bar lies along quite a dfferent position angle to the kinematic major axis. Colour maps reveal varied populations in the bright bars of both galaxies, and the outer disk of NGC 4214. I make detailed comparisons of the galaxies' colour-colour distribution with stellar population models, and employ absorption-line indices from the longslit spectra as cross-checks in a few locations. Taken together the data suggest that over a large fraction of the galaxies there is a young population some tens of Myr old that contributes a few percent of the total stellar mass, though the particular combination of mass fraction and age cannot be uniquely determined. Neither galaxy exhibits strong O/H abundance variations within the bright bar region. Both galaxies are consistent with a model in which a minimum HI surface density (10&#178;&#185;atom.cm&#8254;&#178;)is a necessary criterion for star formation. In NGC 1156 the radial distribution of star-forming regions is well predicted by the disk instability criterion discussed by Kennicutt (1989), while the criterion is less successful in NGC 4214. In a systematic survey of NGC 4214 I identifed 13 holes likely to be expanding or burst shells, roughly in accord with the number expected given the linear resolution and the HII-region population. In a majority of the holes, a star cluster capable of powering the expansion is visible within the hole boundary. However the holes are so young and that I expected all would contain a detectable cluster. In a few regions new star formation appears to have occurred in the walls of the identified holes, but the total number of HII regions near HI holes is consistent with that expected by chance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlation with the hermite series using artificial neural network technology</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the correlation of Hermite functions in the form of a Hermite neural network. The terminology &#8220;Hermite neural network&#8221; describes the Hermite series of orthonormal functions, which have been generalized to include numerical algorithms that are often associated with artificial neural networks. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether there are any benefits over the traditional correlation method using Fourier functions. The relative performance of the Hermite neural network correlator was compared to a Fourier neural network correlator. The main result is that the correlation of a Hermite neural network is a summation of NxN associated Laguerre functions whereas a Fourier neural network correlation is a summation of N Fourier functions. In this regard the Fourier neural network will be more efficient for the general correlation of functions. An exception occurs for the correlation of the Hermite neural network with a Gaussian function, or with the CHIRP radar signal. For these signals the correlation is also a summation of N terms. In these applications the Hermite correlator proved to be superior to the Fourier correlator for the following reasons. &#8226; It does not suffer from a circular correlation error, which is a characteristic of the Fourier correlator. &#8226; It allows the Gaussian inverse correlation to be computed without the numerical instability that occurs with a Fourier correlator. &#8226; It achieves a more compact signal interpolation for the CHIRP radar signal correlator than is possible with a Fourier correlator. The relatively good performance of the Hermite correlation, particularly the numerical stability of the inverse correlation, can be expected to be a useful asset for image processing, where the Gaussian function is especially important. As a digression from the main topic of Hermite neural network correlation, during the investigation a new method of fast training the sigmoid neural network was discovered. The principle of the new training method is that it trains the sigmoid neural network to the rate of change of the unknown non-linear function rather than to the function itself. This allows the sigmoid neural network to be trained with an associated radial basis neural network with the speed that is inherent with this type of network. In tests the associated training method was 100 times faster than the conventional training method for the sigmoid neural network. The new training method can be expected to widen the application of the sigmoid neural network to include applications that have previously not been possible on account of the slow training.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological correlates of interference control in the Eriksen task</field><field name="creator">Broyd, Samantha J</field><field name="description">This thesis examined conflict monitoring in the Eriksen task in which participants must respond to a centrally positioned target arrow and ignore simultaneously presented distractors that flank the target.  Distractors were either associated with a response congruent to the target, in conflict with the target, or, in a neutral condition, not associated with a response, instead producing only perceptual interference. This thesis extended on previous Eriksen research by systematically investigating the effect of varying the level of response conflict and task difficulty on stimulus processing in six studies and clarifying the functional role of ERP components elicited in the Eriksen task.  Specifically, this was achieved by (a) varying the number of flanking distractors and, (b) the level of response conflict by using different permutations of incongruent distractors, (c) reducing target stimulus perceptibility through degradation, (d) utilising both valid and invalid information to increase response preparation and make conflict monitoring more difficult, and (e) providing feedback in a speeded version of the task. In all six studies, two N2 components were clearly delineated &#8211; the first of which was increased to stimuli requiring enhanced feature detection processes (N2a), while the second N2 component (N2b) was consistently observed to increase following the detection of response conflict.  The P3 component, rarely considered in the Eriksen paradigm, was reduced at parietal sites and increased in latency as the discriminability of the target amongst the distractors became more difficult.  The results suggest that the P3 component may reflect stimulus evaluation processes and equivocation related to the ease of target identification and concurrent response selection processes imperative for accurate task performance.  This thesis also utilised digital filtering to clarify time-domain ERP results in terms of the relative contributions of activity in the alpha, theta and delta frequency ranges.  Event-related theta oscillations contributed significantly to the morphology of the two N2 components reflecting allocation of focused attentional resources following the detection of perceptual (theta N2a) or response conflict (theta N2b).  Activity in both theta and delta frequency ranges was robustly observed to contribute to the P3 component.  An increased theta response at frontal sites was observed along with increases in task difficulty likely indexing the activation of anterior attentional resources. The results also suggest that the parietal delta P3 component reflects a refined form of equivocation, sensitive to the perceptibility of the target, and concomitant with the relative ease of accurate response selection. This thesis has clarified successful conflict monitoring and task performance in the Eriksen task, and the relationship with stimulus-locked ERP components in the time and frequency domains. The results suggest that the second frontally maximal N2 component reflects successful conflict monitoring, while the P3 component most probably reflects equivocation arising from difficult target identification and accurate response selection, rather than response conflict per se.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transportation and urban development : the past and future of Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Svein Ivar</field><field name="description">Urban areas of today are very often reliant on the private automobile as opposed to a public transport system. This is certainly the case for the Sydney metropolitan area. The result of a large reliance on the private automobile has been high levels of pollution and congested city centres. If this problem is to be controlled, changes have to be made to the way the metropolitan area is being developed. Different ideas have been proposed throughout time in order to secure a lower use of cars. One reoccurring suggestion is the need for more compact, or planned, communities where people find most of the amenities needed, such as homes, jobs, shopping and recreation facilities. If planners and decision makers are able to secure developments where the end result is a lower level of driving, it becomes possible to limit some of the problems cities of today struggle with. A project that has already influenced driving patterns in the Sydney metropolitan area is the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. Arguably the Tunnel has not been any great success, due to it having created an increase in total cross-harbour traffic. Future projects that will also have an impact on driving patterns are the proposed Cross City Tunnel, the proposed extension of the current tramline to Circular Quay, and a new inner city rail line. These latter projects will, however, as opposed to the Tunnel, have a positive impact on people&#8217;s driving patterns.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">China's response to international fisheries law and policy: national action and regional cooperation</field><field name="creator">Xue, Guifang</field><field name="description">The global fisheries crisis has been of great concern to the international community, and has led to the adoption of a series of instruments under the fisheries framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). These post-LOSC fisheries instruments include the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement); the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (Fish Stocks Agreement); the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); and the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IPOAIUU). The aforementioned instruments have improved the LOSC fisheries framework and had considerable impact on the way fisheries resources are utilised and managed. However, they have not stopped the continual depletion of fisheries resources as they rely largely on the implementation by individual states to achieve their management objectives. The ineffectiveness of these instruments is mainly due to the fact that they have not been widely implemented by, or incorporated into, the fisheries law and policy of states. As one of the major fishing nations with the largest population in the world, China has faced many problems managing its fisheries: the severest of which are the depletion of fisheries resources and the deterioration of the marine environment. This situation has necessitated China&#8217;s alignment with international fisheries law and policy. The study analyses China&#8217;s legislative harmonisation and policy adjustment in response to these international fisheries instruments, in particular resource management, distant water fisheries, and regional fisheries cooperation for the shared fisheries resources in the form of bilateral fisheries agreements with Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. The study pinpoints the fact that China&#8217;s fisheries development, particularly the problems it has encountered, including its excessive fishing capacity, economic incentives, population pressures, and a weak institutional framework, reflect the global situation and provides a basis for understanding the driving forces behind a gradual loss of control of fishing capacity leading to the depletion of resources. China&#8217;s national action and regional cooperation mirrors the overall effort of the international community in searching for possible solutions to address the fisheries crisis. The study emphasises that the LOSC will remain as a dynamic instrument and a point of reference for the legal norms at the global, regional and national levels to deal with the countless issues of fisheries management. The post-LOSC instruments will stand as guidelines for states to conserve and manage fisheries resources on the way to achieving sustainable fisheries. States like China will have to fully commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities to achieve sustainable fisheries management.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating university teaching and learning in an outcome-based model: replanting Bloom</field><field name="creator">Morris, Maureen Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis was inspired by an experienced teacher&#8217;s desire to enhance student learning through implementation of a teaching/learning framework focused on promotion of higher order cognition. Two case studies document the construction, implementation and evaluation of learning frameworks for two disparate undergraduate university subjects.Structurally, the thesis falls into three component parts. In the first, the researcher has reviewed the literature for an appropriate methodology, grounded her understanding of student learning through examination of relevant learning theories, canvassed suitable pedagogical strategies before construction of the teaching/learning frameworks, and devised an evaluation framework. In the second part, the two case studies have been described and in the final part, the threads of evidence have been drawn into the conclusion.Action research afforded an appropriate methodology for the study. It offered facility for a spiral of implementation, review and re-implementation. Bound as a practitioner by the pragmatic perspective of what works, the researcher engaged multiple methodologies (grounded research encompassing elements of phenomenology and ethnography) in both case studies. She adopted a mixed method approach, with evidence derived from assessment data, survey responses, her annotated journal and comments from collaborating teachers and students.The researcher&#8217;s primary intent was to construct aligned teaching/learning frameworks that promoted contextualised thinking for students in the two disciplines. Judgment of the effectiveness of the resulting frameworks in enhancing student learning required a strict evaluative regimen.Key issues percolated through the thinking of the researcher/teacher:&#8226; life-long learning;&#8226; meta-cognition and deeper learning; and&#8226; marking of assessment that recognises achievement of learning objectives, offers students task related feedback and does not merely represent an aggregation of marks for ranking of students along a curve.Therefore, strategies were included that fostered independent learning and promoted productive collaboration, while marking criteria formed the focus for aligning marking with the objectives.The primary case study examined teaching and learning in a foundation course in statistics at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The intent was to foster statistical thinking in students. Experienced in the field, the teacher assumed an active role as a participant researcher. In consultation with discipline experts and innovative teachers, the researcher/teacher observed the existing environment for a single session (N=159). Learning objectives were then rigorously scrutinised and behaviourally reframed; objectives were specified for learning and assessment tasks; and marking criteria devised to scaffold student responses, check assessment for objective achievement and provide detailed and task related feedback. Thus the objectives formed the agents of constructive alignment.Implementation of the selected strategies was tracked over the subsequent four sessions (cohorts ranging in size from 152 to 192 students). Evidence of student learning and the effectiveness of the framework was derived from:&#8226; assessment marks and grades;&#8226; deconstruction of assessment tasks and responses using the revised Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001);&#8226; student survey responses;&#8226; teacher and marker survey responses;&#8226; the researcher&#8217;s journal, annotated by collaborative teachers; and&#8226; peer discussions.Results have highlighted increases in mean marks in summative assessment accompanied by shifts to higher order cognitive demand in assessment tasks across the implementations. Furthermore, strong correlations between proportions of students reporting confidence in topic learning and exam performance have lent credence to the teacher&#8217;s claim that students know what they know and know what they do not know.The aim of the second case study was the design and implementation of an aligned curriculum for a subject focused on promoting critical and evaluative thinking in undergraduate accounting students. Although not the teacher/researcher&#8217;s field of expertise, intense consultations with the subject designers produced behaviourally framed objectives and a teaching/learning framework that targeted the desired skills. This case study consisted of a single implementation (N=223). Results were not conclusive, but examination of the detail has provided fresh insight into the potential value of peer evaluation and student portfolios to address the desired thinking.Comparison of the two case studies has highlighted the marked similarity between the teacher&#8217;s expectations of statistical thinking, which underpins the University of Wollongong subject, and critical and evaluative thinking, which underpins the University of Western Sydney subject. &#8216;Structure&#8217; has been identified as essential to successful implementation of the frameworks targeting discipline thinking. The structure of the desired thinking needs not only to be modelled but also to be recognised by students before it is effectively assimilated.The researcher&#8217;s journey has required reflective practice that includes both telescopic and microscopic review of her thinking, her habits and the action and reaction occurring within her classroom. The evaluation of student learning undertaken in this thesis has formalised the teacher&#8217;s informal and intuitive response to the ostensibly absurd behaviours that take place as her students learn. Her deconstruction and interpretation of the apparent incongruities has at once affirmed past practice and inspired its renewal.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influential factors in the trust relationships existing between financial analysts and corporate managers in Iran</field><field name="creator">Nasrabadi, Mehdi ArabSalehi</field><field name="description">This research explored the role of trust in the relationship between the financial analysts and corporate managers in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) by focusing on two important aspects of the trust relationship. These aspects are key trustworthiness factors and the influential factors to perceive these key factors. Financial analysts use financial reports, which are prepared by corporate managers, in their analysis. In this thesis components of trust are distinguished from each other. These components are antecedent factors to trust, trust, and outcome of trust. Trust is considered as the financial analysts intention to depend on managers based on their perception of managers key characteristics including: integrity, benevolence, competence, and predictability. Antecedent factors to trust are psychological and sociological factors that influence the perception of financial analysts about those key characteristics. These antecedent factors include: related factors to: financial reports, management as well as external auditors, rules and regulations, and religion- Islam. The financial analysts trust in corporate mangers results in their reliance in the provided financial reports. The level of financial analysts reliance on the financial reports is positively associated with the level of their trust in managers. The theoretical model of trust developed by &#65533; is modified to apply in Iranian context. Purposive sampling is used to collect the required data. The primary data is gathered from in-depth interviews with 20 financial analysts in Iran. After that, the pattern coding technique proposed by Miles and Huberman (1994) is applied to summarise and analyse the interview data. The pattern matching technique is then used to compare the results of interviews to the theoretical patterns. The main findings of this research are: 1) trust is important in the relationship between the financial analysts and corporate mangers, 2) the degree of trust that the financial analysts put in the corporate managers is identified by the corporate managers level of trustworthiness, 3) the key factors of trustworthiness of a corporate manager are integrity, benevolence, competence, and predictability in his/her behaviour, 4) a model of trust relationship which explains how financial analysts build their relationships is suggested, 5) the main reason for financial analysts to build the relationship with corporate managers is to get accurate information about the company, especially inside information. This research contributes to the literature of trust which include: (i) adding trust as an important element in business relationship (ii) providing empirical evidence of the key factors of trustworthiness (iii) providing empirical evidence of the influential factors on the trust relationship between financial analyst and corporate managers (iv) proposing a new model of a trust relationship between the financial analysts and corporate managers. This research has several limitations that limit the findings to be generalised. These include: Firstly, in the selected sample, the relationship between the financial analysts and corporate managers was very specific. This is because: the Iranian financial market, the Iranian financial analysis industry, and the TSE all are in an early stage of development. Secondly, the required data were collected through conducting semi-structured interviews with financial analysts only. It was not possible therefore to directly monitor the actual relationship between financial analysts and corporate managers. As a result of this restriction, the researcher had to accept the statements made by financial analysts and the data analysis had to be limited to the results of these interviews. Thirdly, because the beliefs and attitudes of financial analysts had to be translated from Farsi into English in the process of translation some concepts may not have been conveyed correctly because of the linguistic differences. Fourthly, there is a lack of previous research in this area, especially in the Iranian financial market. The study also suggests some prospective areas for investigation by applying the research proposed mode in different business relationships such as the relationship between investors and corporate mangers and relationship between investors and financial analysts. The results of these suggested studies may be helpful to build a general model of trust which would be applied in different business relationships.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurturing the inner lives of children: an exploration of children's spirituality in three educational settings</field><field name="creator">Nemme, Kori</field><field name="description">Using the theoretical framework of Howard Gardner (1999) and David Hay and Rebecca Nye (2006) this qualitative inquiry aimed to identify and describe children&#8217;s day-to-day experiences of spirituality in a range of social settings. In the context of this study spirituality was described in terms of meaning and connectedness and as a means to direct and give value to an individual&#8217;s actions and beliefs.Case studies were employed at the early childhood, primary and lower high school settings to gain an understanding of spirituality across childhood. The research focused upon the classroom context and other social situations, investigating both formal teaching of spirituality and children&#8217;s informal interaction and exploration of spiritual matters. Data collection methods were primarily based upon observation but also included interviews, work samples and journal entries.The research involved two phases of data collection. In the course of Phase one, each of the research sites were visited for one day per week across eight weeks, whereby data collection focused on the whole class situation and on all consenting participants. After the eight weeks, data continued to be collected on all participants yet focused more specifically on six case-study children selected purposely for more detailed study.This thesis extends the classic work in the area by Gardner (1999) and Hay and Nye (2006) by illustrating what four spiritual sensing categories &#8211; State of being: Awareness-sensing, State of being: Mystery-sensing, Concern for existential issues: Mystery-sensing, and Concern for existential issues: Values-sensing &#8211; surfaced as in the day-to-day lives of children in secular educational settings and other social environments. What also emerged through the case studies was the existence of various factors that supported children&#8217;s engagement with their spirituality. Differences were identified regarding the approach of families and the educational settings, however, the influences of the media, sports, peers, and religious teachings were also recognised. In particular, spirituality was addressed differently at the three educational settings in terms of the teacher&#8217;s influence, school curriculum, and physical environment. Variance among these elements impacted the ways in which children could express their spirituality at school, thus affirming the important contribution that public school education can make towards young people's spiritual development.As the result of this investigation, this present study suggested several recommendations for nurturing children&#8217;s spirituality at their home settings and in secular educational settings. These included: recognising children&#8217;s spirituality as an integral aspect of the child&#8217;s development; the provision of adequate time; demonstrating an open and approachable manner; awareness to spiritual dialogue and nonverbal communication; facilitating and addressing spiritual questions; creating belonging and community; encouraging self-reflection; demonstrating role-modeling behaviours and attitudes; attending to informal moments; awareness of expectation; creation of space and environment; and, supplying resources and experiences for engagement with the spiritual domain. Several factors were also identified specific to facilitating spirituality at educational settings. These included, building teacher-student relationships to develop awareness of the context in which children are located and employing spirituality as both an entry point and subject matter to engage learning. The recommendations also indicated the need for further policy development based upon empirical work, integrating the understanding of children&#8217;s spirituality into teacher training courses, and, future research which extends the spiritual framework of this inquiry to other populations of children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to the fears of early childhood: an investigation of perception and practice in emotion education</field><field name="creator">Sorin, Reesa Sheryl</field><field name="description">The focus of this study was to investigate basic emotions, in particular the emotion of fear, as they are reported to be experienced by preschool children and how fear is responded to by parents and caregivers. To accomplish this, it looked firstly at whether eight basic emotions are reported as present in the preschool child. It then focused on fear: which fears are reported as experienced by preschool children and how they are displayed. Parents were surveyed as to how they respond to their child's fears and all participants were asked to report how caregivers in the early childhood settings respond to children's fears. Participants were asked to comment on the effectiveness of caregivers' current practices in responding to fear, and to suggest further approaches that could be taken in responding to children's fears.The study is qualitative in design, using a constructivist framework to examine fear and adults' responses to fear by collecting individual constructions from preschool children, their parents, their caregivers and the researcher. This was undertaken using a variety of tools, including: Parents' Surveys, Caregivers' Surveys and Focal Group Interviews; observations by the researcher;  and a reflective journal kept by the researcher. Data were collected over a six-month period from four early childhood settings available to children aged three to five in the area: a long day care centre, an independent preschool; a preschool attached to a school; and a multifunctional Aboriginal children's. Total participants included forty-five children aged between three and five years old, forty-six parents and twenty-one caregivers. The eight basic emotions surveyed were reported as present in preschool children, however reports of fears varied greatly between parents, caregivers and the children themselves. Caregivers reported the least awareness of fears in children. This may be accounted for by the limited time and context that caregivers have with children. However, if caregivers' jobs are to prepare children for learning and for life, they need to be aware of all aspects of child development and of how they can help each child to reach her/his potential. A variety of methods were reported by both parents and caregivers to respond to children's fears. However, not all of these methods proved effective; some even seemed to invalidate the emotion of fear in young children. For example, denying fear or modelling non-fearful behaviour may give children unrealistic messages about the emotion. A discrepancy between parents' reports of their own responses to fear and of caregivers' responses was noted, even though many parents reported similarities in parental and caregivers' approaches. Parents reported that they responded to children's fears in both verbal and physical ways. Yet parents expected caregivers to respond to children's fears by talking to them; few mentioned physical responses such as giving the child a cuddle. This may be due to the current social context where child protection is focused on by the mass media. While caregivers were often reported to be extensions of parents in their responses to fear, some caregivers reported implementing teaching and planning strategies in addressing fear. Many participants reported that caregivers' responses to children's fears could be more effective, and some offered suggestions for further responding to children's fears.Most participants seemed to view fear as negative and in need of eradication. The literature, however, suggests that it is important to understand all emotions and to be able to express them in ways that are both individually and socially acceptable. This means a shift in social/pedagogical thinking to a more emotion-based curriculum, supportive of emotion understanding and expression.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dosimetric verification of intensity modulated radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Alison</field><field name="description">Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a relatively new treatment planning and delivery technique. The complex multiple-segment nature of an IMRT plan makes it difficult to verify using traditional look-up tables and hand calculations.The purpose of this project was to develop an effective and time-efficient plan checking procedure using a combination of ionisation chambers and film. The dosimeters available were 0.03 cc volume and 0.6 cc volume thimble ionisation chambers, Kodak X-Omat V (XV) film and Kodak Extende Dose Range (EDR2) film. First the dosimeters were tested for accuracy in terms of their dose response in the clinical range required (up to about 200 cGy). All were found to be suitable for further investigation for use in IMRT plan checking.One non-IMRT and six IMRT plans were validated. The plans were transferred from the patient geometry to a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cubic phantom made up of slabs of solid water. The ionisation chambers and films were calibrated and used to measure the dose delivered to the phantom at the isocentre for each beam and for an entire IMRT treatment. The film was also used to provide axial and planar dose distribution maps for comparison with the predicted distributions. Time restraints meant that not every type of dosimeter was used for every beam and treatment plan.It was found that the isocentric 0.6 cc volume ionisation chamber provided a suitably accurate dose check, with an average difference between predicted and measured full treatment doses of 2.0 cGy with a standard deviation of 2.7 cGy and 1.5% with a standard deviation of 2.1%. The film was less successful, with the EDR2 film (digitised and analysed using ImageJ software) giving an average difference between predicted and asured full treatment doses of 5.4 cGy with a standard deviation of 4.0 cGy and 4.0% with a standard deviation of 3.1%. The film was very useful for obtaining qualitative dose distribution maps, which could be used as surrogates to verify that the radiotherapy treatment planning system&#8217;s co-ordinate information was being transferred correctly.Following the results of the test cases a procedure was established for all future IMRT plans. The procedure can easily be varied to include further measurements if necessary, and consists of measuring the dose at isocentre from each beam and the whole treatment using the 0.6 cc ionisation chamber. EDR2 film is to be used to visually verify the axial dose distribution, and XV film to verify planar dose distributions for each beam.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Crunk', 'cracking' and 'choreographies': the place and meaning of health and physical activity in the lives of young people from culturally diverse urban neighborhoods</field><field name="creator">Atencio, Matthew</field><field name="description">As a number of writers have pointed out (Cole, 1996; Giardina, 2003; Kirk, 1999; McCarthy, Giardina, Harewood, &amp; Park, 2003; Rail, 1998, Silk &amp; Andrews, 2001), in Western societies individuals construct their plural and fluid subjectivities by engaging with broader cultural discourses existing in a &#8216;larger global frame of reference&#8217; (Giardina, 2003, p.66). From this perspective, this thesis explores the ways young people take up multiple subjectivities by translating and appropriating the &#8216;texts&#8217; of a multivalent global sport and &#8216;physical&#8217; culture in subversive, (re)productive, and conformist ways. The primary mode of analysis involved investigating how these &#8216;mobile subjectivities&#8217; (Rail, 1998, p. xv) reflected the young people&#8217;s specific class, gender, and cultural positionings, as well as their biographical histories and geographic backgrounds (Kirk, 1999).The study in this thesis simultaneously appropriated and critiqued several aspects of ethnographic research. Drawing from postcolonial and poststructural theoretical frameworks, qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews and observations were used to investigate the place and meaning of health and physical activity in the lives of young people from diverse &#8216;racial&#8217;, &#8216;ethnic&#8217;, and diasporic backgrounds. The young people&#8217;s use of their urban neighbourhood physical activity spaces was mapped and analyzed using methods informed by cultural geography. The analysis that was conducted paid specific attention to the unstable power relations inherent in the research interactions, and multiple and contradictory narratives were produced.Results of the study revealed that the young people came to exist as &#8216;healthy&#8217; subjects by engaging with physical culture discourses concerned with the maintenance, representation, and regulation of the body through dieting and exercise (Kirk, 1999). The young people made moral judgments about health through a cyclical association of appearance, attitude, and behavior. Healthiness was considered to be a desirable state of being that could be achieved through the adoption of specific eating and exercise practices. According to the young people, adherence to these practices could be read off the body. This belief was crystallized in their descriptions of &#8216;fat&#8217; people and &#8216;couch potatoes&#8217; who they considered to be lazy, unmotivated, and poor decision makers. However, in later comments the young people defined health in much more complex and contradictory ways, in relation to their gendered and racialized backgrounds. They eventually took up and contested the available health discourses in very diverse and subtle ways from each other and in comparison to their white counterparts found in other research studies.Another point of analysis was formulated to address the social impacts of space on the cultures of basketball and dancing. An examination of the young people&#8217;s spatial movements through their interview texts indicated that both institutional and &#8216;informal&#8217; basketball and dance spaces played a significant role in the promulgation of gendered and &#8216;racial&#8217; power relationships.In the park basketball courts, the young African-American men with the most talent and physical strength were able to exclude and constrain other young men and women from participating. In so doing, these young men were able to take up positions of power within social hierarchies that privileged and (re)produced their hegemonic &#8216;black&#8217; masculinities. The social practices which underpinned these unequal power relationships were linked with seductive &#8216;empowerment through sport&#8217; discourses operating in the young people&#8217;s impoverished urban neighborhoods.Analysis also revealed that the institutional dance spaces within the local high school (re)produced certain bodily practices which served to exclude and marginalize the &#8216;black&#8217; young women in my study. Particularly in the advanced dance classes and programs, social practices were (re)produced which   served to favor the &#8216;thin&#8217; white young women and their bodies. The &#8216;black&#8217; young women in my study were positioned as &#8216;hyper-sexual&#8217; and &#8216;sloppy&#8217;, and thus incapable, because of their devalued forms of &#8216;physical capital&#8217; (Bourdieu, 1984). Yet, these &#8216;black&#8217; young women were able to deploy unique performative acts through their bodies in order to recoup their deficit positioning as the &#8216;black&#8217; female &#8216;Other&#8217;. The diverse and complex ways that these young women used the dance spaces to refigure their subjectivities illustrates that gender and &#8216;race&#8217; are experienced differentially, and are not unifying and fixed categories.From these analyses I suggest that health, sport, and physical activity discourses aligned with power configurations in a variety of institutional, cultural, and geographic contexts profoundly shapes young people&#8217;s lives in psychic and corporeal ways. At the same time, young people constitute their multiple and fluid subjectivities by actively appropriating, (re)producing, and contesting these discourses in ways that serve to disrupt &#8216;normalizing&#8217; practices and knowledge.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D-audio object oriented coding</field><field name="creator">Potard, Guillaume</field><field name="description">This thesis first presents a novel object-oriented scheme which provides for ex- tensive description of time-varying 3D audio scenes using XML. The scheme, named XML3DAUDIO, provides a new format for encoding and describing 3D audio scenes in an object oriented manner. Its creation was motivated by the fact that other 3D audio scene description formats are either too simplistic (VRML) and lacking in realism, or are too complex (MPEG-4 Advanced AudioBIFS) and, as a result, have not yet been fully implemented in available decoders and scene authoring tools. This thesis shows that the scene graph model, used by VRML and MPEG-4 AudioBIFS, leads to complex and ine&#177;cient 3D audio scene descriptions. This complexity is a result of the aggregation, in the scene graph model, of the scene content data and the scene temporal data. The resulting 3D audio scene descriptions, are in turn, difficult to re-author and signifcantly increase the complexity of 3D audio scene renderers. In contrast, XML3DAUDIO follows a new scene orchestra and score approach which allows the separation of the scene content data from the scene temporal data; this simplifies 3D audio scene descriptions and allows simpler 3D audio scene renderer implementations. In addition, the separation of the temporal and content data permits easier modification and re-authoring of 3D audio scenes. It is shown that XML3DAUDIO can be used as a new format for 3D audio scene rendering or can alternatively be used as a meta-data scheme for annotating 3D audio content.Rendering and perception of the apparent extent of sound sources in 3D audio displays is then considered. Although perceptually important, the extent of sound sources is one the least studied auditory percepts and is often neglected in 3D audio displays. This research aims to improve the realism of rendered 3D audio scenes by reproducing the multidimensional extent exhibited by some natural sound sources (eg a beach front, a swarm of insects, wind blowing in trees etc). Usually, such broad sound sources are treated as point sound sources in 3D audio displays, resulting in unrealistic rendered 3D audio scenes. A technique is introduced whereby, using several uncorrelated sound sources, the apparent extent of a sound source can be controlled in arbitrary ways. A new hypothesis is presented suggesting that, by placing uncorrelated sound sources in particular patterns, sound sources with apparent shapes can be obtained. This hypothesis and the perception of vertical and horizontal sound source extent are then evaluated in several psychoacoustic experiments. Results showed that, using this technique, subjects could perceive the horizontal extent of sound sources with high precision, differentiate horizontally from vertically extended sound sources and could identify the apparent shapes of sound sources above statistical chance. In the latter case, however, the results show identification less than 50 % of the time, and then only when noise signals were used. Some of these psychoacoustic experiments were carried out for the MPEG standardisation body with a view to adding sound source extent description capabilities to the MPEG-4 AudioBIFS standard; the resulting modifications have become part of the new capabilities in version 3 of AudioBIFS.Lastly, this thesis presents the implementation of a novel real-time 3D audio rendering system known as CHESS (Configurable Hemispheric Environment for Spatialised Sound). Using a new signal processing architecture and a novel 16-speaker array, CHESS demonstrates the viability of rendering 3D audio scenes described with the XML3DAUDIO scheme. CHESS implements all 3D audio signal processing tasks required to render a 3D audio scene from its textual description; the definition of these techniques and the architecture of CHESS is extensible and can thus be used as a basis model for the implementation of future object oriented 3D audio rendering systems.Thus, overall, this thesis presents ontributions in three interwoven domains of 3D audio: 3D audio scene description, spatial psychoacoustics and 3D audio scene rendering.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extended adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chun Yin</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a novel extension to the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which we call extended ANFIS (EANFIS). The extension includes the introduction of an output class based membership function architecture, in which each output class in a discrete output situation has its own membership function and in the case of a continuous output, only one class; the possibility of determining the structure of the rule base from the underlying structure of the input variables; the determination of a possibly non-symmetric membership function the parameters of which can be determined automatically from the given input variables; the possibility of incorporating global information on the input variables through a Linear Discriminant Analysis in combination with the local input variable structure as represented by the membership functions. The possibility of determining the structure of the rule section before the training process commences means that the proposed EANFIS architecture can be applied to possibility large scale practical problems, as it does not require the formation of all possible combination of rules before the training process commences. In other words, the EANFIS architecture together with its structure determining procedures overcomes the current limitation facing ANFIS architecture when applied to systems with large number of inputs. The possibility of determining a membership function from the input variables means the user no longer needs to select a membership function from a set of candidate membership functions. The possibility of incorporating global information on the input variables in addition to the local information on input variables means that the EANFIS architecture can take advantage when such global information might be useful in improving the performance of the Neuro-Fuzzy System. The new EANFIS architecture is evaluated on a number of standard benchmark problems, and have been found to have superior performance. In addition, as this is an EANFIS, rules can be extracted from the trained system, thus providing information on the way in which the underlying system is operating. The proposed EANFIS recommends itself readily for applications in practical systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of cell wall proteins, virulence factor maturation and invasive disease trigger of Group A Steptococcus</field><field name="creator">Cole, Jason Nicklaus</field><field name="description">Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus; GAS) is a Gram-positive human pathogen responsible for numerous life-threatening diseases, including necrotising fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The non-suppurative sequelae of acute rhematic fever (ARF) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) may develop upon repeated exposure to GAS. Over the last two decades, there has been a world-wide resurgence in GAS infection. In this study, a proteomic analysis was undertaken to identify the major cell wall-associated proteins of GAS. Mutanolysin cell wall extracts from GAS strain NS931 (serotype M69), NS13 (serotype M53) and S43 (serotype M6) were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the landmark proteins identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. A total of 155 protein spots representing 74 distinct cell wall-associated proteins were identified, with molecular masses ranging from 14.4 to 77.5-kDa and a pI range of 4.4 to 7.9. Of these 74 proteins, nine putative virulence determinants (including M protein, SpeB, SpeM, FcrA, arginine deiminase, superoxide dismutase, C3-degrading protease and the two plasminogen-binding proteins SEN and Plr/GAPDH), eight glycolytic enzymes, eight carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, two chaperonins and four proteins with transporter function were detected in one or more of the GAS strains examined. Two-dimensional immunoblot analysis with pooled GAS-reactive human antisera revealed that thirty-three of these proteins were immunoreactive. Biotinylation of the GAS cell surface prior to two-dimensional western blotting identified a subset of twenty-three cell wall-associated proteins that are surface-exposed. These data illustrate the usefulness of proteomics in analysing the cell surface topology of GAS, which lays the foundation for future work identifying new GAS virulence determinants and vaccine antigens. The multifunctional chaperone and serine protease HtrA (DegP) is involved in the refolding and degradation of aberrant proteins destined for secretion. In numerous pathogenic organisms HtrA is required for thermostability, resistance to oxidative stress and full virulence. The HtrA of human pathogen S. pyogenes influences the maturation of secreted virulence factors streptolysin S and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), and is localised at the ExPortal secretory microdomain. In this study, we examined the role of HtrA in regulating expression of GAS virulence phenotypes. An in-frame htrA deletion mutant displayed similar growth kinetics to the wild-type (wt) in the presence of paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Lack of HtrA did not influence capsule production or GAS adherence and invasion of human epithelial cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis detected elevated levels of cleaved M protein fragments in the htrA mutant culture supernatant. The HtrA-mutant also had higher levels of cell wall-associated M protein than the wt. Time-course analysis of culture supernatant showed that the degradation rate of several virulence factors, including M protein, streptokinase, streptococcal enolase, superoxide dismutase A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was reduced in the htrA mutant. This degradation corresponded to a lag in the processing of the 40-kDa SpeB zymogen to the active 28-kDa form. In vitro protease assays demonstrated that proteolytically active HtrA was unable to process SpeB zymogen to the active protease. These data indicate that HtrA is essential for the efficient maturation of SpeB zymogen into the active protease and the subsequent SpeB-mediated degradation of surface and secreted GAS virulence factors. The globally disseminated S. pyogenes M1T1 clone causes a number of highly invasive human diseases. The transition from local to systemic infection occurs by an unknown mechanism; however invasive M1T1 clinical isolates are known to express significantly less of the cysteine protease SpeB than M1T1 isolates from local infections. Here, we show that in comparison to the M1T1 strain 5448, the isogenic mutant &#8710;speB accumulated 75-fold more human plasmin activity on the bacterial surface following incubation in human plasma. SpeB was shown to degrade several bacterial and host molecules that contribute to the accumulation of bacterial surface plasmin activity. Human plasminogen was an absolute requirement for M1T1 strain 5448 virulence following subcutaneous infection of humanised plasminogen transgenic mice. S. pyogenes M1T1 isolates from the blood of infected humanised plasminogen transgenic mice expressed reduced levels of SpeB in comparison with the parental 5448 used as inoculum. The M1T1 mutant &#8710;speB displayed markedly reduced virulence in this transgenic model, demonstrating a requirement for SpeB at the site of infection. We propose that the human plasminogen system plays a critical role in group A streptococcal M1T1 systemic disease initiation. Although SpeB is required for S. pyogenes M1T1 survival at the site of local infection, it also disrupts the interaction of S. pyogenes M1T1 with the human plasminogen activation system. Therefore, loss of SpeB activity in a sub-population of S. pyogenes M1T1 at the site of infection results in accumulation of surface plasmin activity thus triggering systemic spread.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal prediction of coastal acid sulfate soil severity using geographic information systems</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Marcus John</field><field name="description">Coastal Acid Sulfate Soil (CASS) is a soil-water phenomenon that causes soil and water pollution resulting from the exposure, typically human-initiated, of pyrite to atmospheric and biotic oxygen. Structural deformation of capital works, combined with loss to flora and fauna (biodiversity) resulting from CASS has caused major concern to environmental managers, industries that rely directly on high quality water conditions for day-to-day operations, and landholders who experience characteristic scalding and other associated environmental problems on land adjacent to disturbed areas.Areas of CASS in Australia have been identified by Department of Natural Resources (DNR) using a combination of expert knowledge, geomorphologic principles and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) known as Acid Sulfate Soil Risk Maps. These maps have been applied by local managers in planning and natural resource management to identify areas showing the highest probability of being severely affected by CASS. In this project, with the DNR model as a starting point, the aim was to improve the way CASS severity is assessed. This included using five major soil-chemical parameters and/or relationships in a number of geostatistical models. The five parameters included were: Total Actual Acidity (TAA), pH, Chloride to Sulfate ratio (Cl-:SO4 2-), Depth to actual CASS layer (Jarosite layer), and Exchangeable Aluminium per cent of total Cation Exchange Capacity. Other parameters such as depth to Potential CASS layer (Pyrite layer) and Sulfur per cent (S%), also have weight but not as significant as the other parameters and were subsequently removed from further detailed analysis.Ordinary Kriging (OK) was identified as the most suitable geostatistical method to predict CASS severity using the aforementioned soil-chemical principles. The resulting 3-Dimensional model was compared to the 2-Dimensional DNR Risk Maps with similarities in both models validating both approaches in determining severity using different methods. The CASSOK model put a greater emphasis on soil parameters down the soil profile and how they relate to surface elevation across a finite study area (Broughton Creek floodplain, New South Wales).Applying the new CASSOK model to broader areas of New South Wales will be dependent on available data to input into the model. Using the current DNR risk maps is a broad indication of an area, using CASSOK will give a greater indication of what can be expected 2m below the surface. The ability to create a method that can be applied across the entire state of New South Wales, and then to a national level will be an invaluable resource to land managers in future planning and risk management.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The World Bank and the post-Washington Consensus in Vietnam and Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Engel, Susan</field><field name="description">This thesis undertakes a detailed examination of the development theory and practice of the World Bank and, in particular, its shift from the Washington Consensus to the so-called post-Washington Consensus.

Thus, the first part of the thesis explores the origins, history and development theory of the Bank in the context of the prevailing ideas and political power. While the Bank's move away from the Washington Consensus from the early to mid-1990s has been explored by a number of academics, this thesis is the first attempt to systematically outline the contents of the post-Washington Consensus development model. These contents are utilised in the second part of the thesis to structure a detailed analysis of the Bank's lending practices in two countries, Vietnam and Indonesia. The case studies enable the development of some empirically-based conclusions regarding the extent to which the rhetoric of the post-Washington Consensus has been incorporated into the Bank's lending practices.

Methodology: 38 adolescent girls (Year 11) were recruited to participate in the program as either intervention (n=17) or control group (n=21) participants. The intervention program aimed at increasing physical activity by improving enjoyment, physical self-perception and perceived competence. Baseline and follow-up (11 weeks) assessments included enjoyment of physical activity (PACES), physical self-perception (PSPP), and physical activity (accelerometers). The study also contained qualitative data collection to formulate the intervention design and quantitative data to allow for greater understanding of the needs and wants of adolescent girls with regard to their school sport programs. This qualitative data was collected through focus group interviews, observations, and teacher/student commentary. Results: The results were reported in terms of comparison between intervention and control groups based on the analysis of data from each of the collection instruments. Results also contain a discussion on the formative qualitative data. Conclusions: Data highlights major barriers confronting adolescent girls' participation in school sport. Some of these include teacher attitudes and support, activities and programming, purpose and distinction, and student input. Negotiating these barriers and overcoming them in a school setting appears feasible with support from the entire school community. Furthermore, the study showed that the intervention was able to achieve a positive medium effect on enjoyment of physical activity and perceived body image (0.42 and 0.50 respectively, using Cohen's d). A novel finding of this research was a slowing in the decline of physical activity even though intervention and control groups were engaged in programs with significantly different estimated rates of energy expenditure. Intervention and control group mean energy expenditure was 4.25 and 6.2 respectively indicating that future physical activity interventions should focus on interest and enjoyment rather than programming for increased levels of intensity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of common cost allocation for in-house bid pricing for a competitive niche market: a case study of a city council in the Australian state of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Rafiuddin</field><field name="description">Outsourcing in the public sector has been an issue of much debate in the Australian public sector over the last one and a half decades. Following a decade long experimentation elsewhere in the wake of public sector reforms, primarily in Western and other OECD countries, it has impacted upon various tiers of the Australian Public Sector since the late eighties. The reasons for such debates centred on the role of government in serving its citizens from a shrinking revenue base and rising unemployment levels. After the early 1990s management theorists have challenged the efficiencies of governments. Government production has been labelled as inefficient and ineffective. To redress these allegations, various countries adopted measures to lift the performance of the public sector. Some of the measures were administrative in nature, while others directly impacted the operational aspects of government service provision. As a result, intellectual currents flowed back and forth among countries about their practices to address the inefficiencies. Overall, the tiers of governments were scrutinised for their performance. Local governments in different countries were seen to have addressed these concerns more than any other level of government. This is evidenced by the prevalence of a rich body of literature on contracting out in local government contexts. Ironically, the outsourcing practices in local governments lacked the rigour demanded by critics. Allegations were made that the methods for evaluating government efficiency and of reforms for making sourcing decisions are historically flawed. Though these did not bear much on the decisions of the public servants in the past, they mattered a lot in recent times, especially in the wake of declining revenue bases in local government. The reform advocates demanded inputs from accounting professionals in making their administrative decisions. In particular, outsourcing of big-ticket items over multi-year period attracted the attention of local government bodies. So there have been increasing calls for more research into outsourcing decisions using contemporary managerial and accounting practices. The role of local government management accountants suddenly became prominent within their organisations. This thesis has addressed this gap in the literature by introducing a holistic framework for pricing government production and evaluating bid decisions. Attempts have been made to use theory triangulation, drawing on literature from public administration, economics, management accounting and government financial management. The conceptual framework of the thesis extends research to date by bringing in the theoretical and practical rigour for competitively pricing internal bids and making decisions. A case study method has been adopted to collect and analyse data from primary and secondary sources. In analysing data, the triangulation approach has been used to reinforce the findings and validate the conclusions reached in this thesis. A local government city council in New South Wales has been used to conduct the case study. The major findings of this thesis are that outsourcing practices in the researched organisation reflected two distinct theoretical perspectives, the transaction cost theory (TCE), and the new managerialism (which descended from Public Choice Theory Overall, outsourcing practices in the researched organisation were not prevalent. But after the introduction of public sector reforms, the processes of sourcing decisions were much more formalised, and the managerial accountability was made more rigorous. Finally, overhead allocation played a vital role in pricing internal bids in both cases. Especially, the role of overhead allocation in bid pricing emerged as a dominant theme after the introduction of public sector reform in the researched organisation.

Teachers have responded to this challenge with varying degrees of enthusiasm and success as they meet the challenge of rethinking their understanding of what it is to be literate and therefore their approach to providing literacy learning opportunities in classrooms. This study aims to examine the role of computer-based technologies in the learning and teaching of writing in one Year 4 classroom. Observations, interviews, the teacher&#65533;s program and student work samples collected during this study revealed that the skills and strategies required for traditional literacies are still relevant in the construction of texts using computer-based technologies. The study also demonstrated that these traditional skills are combined with other skills and strategies for the creation of new literacies emerging from computer-based technologies. The findings of this study indicate that computer-based technologies force teachers to broaden their notion of what text is and how students best learn about writing.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kiama: its region and community 1901 to 1938</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Elaine M</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Kiama region, its economics and the social progress of its environs during the years 1901 to 1938. It recognises the basic self-sufficiency and independent nature of the inhabitants and the individuality in rural and village life as it places the Kiama society within the context of a changing world. This *outside world* brought issues and influences that intruded into, and disturbed the simple on-going rhythm of the rural life. The thesis recognises the influence of the region-s geographical and environmental elements and the difficulties encountered by people in their attempts to advance and expand the dairying and metal industries. Transport, communication and improving technology all played a part in the progress and development of these industries. Work in relation to gender is considered, and irrespective of class, the ways by which males and females performed their duties within the family unit and within the community. Religion and respectability were also important elements in their lives. However, World War 1 created change as the community was forced to experience the anxieties and distress of wartime commitments. By the 1920s Kiama was trying to reconstruct its earlier pre-1914 life style, but it could not return to the ways of the past. With the advance of the depression years, commencing around 1938, the Kiama community could no longer *shrug off* or protect itself against the influences of the *outside world*.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cybernetic view of teacher learning</field><field name="creator">Murray, Margaret J</field><field name="description">This study examines teacher learning through a cybernetic lens, exploring the questions: what is learning and who do people learn; why do people learn this and not something else; how does learning happen and what is the role of communications and the environment. It investigates teacher learning in the context of the NSW Department of Education and Training&#65533;s Technology in Learning and Teaching (TILT) teacher development program. It takes as a starting point teacher learning in TILT evidenced by statewide research since 1995 and discusses this research and the on-going development of the program in the context of change theory and teacher development literature. According to this literature the program was developed on sound principles and could be said to have had partial success. However partial success of the program in these terms indicates little about the nature of the learning of individual teachers. To address this silence the research focuses on the learning of two TILT participants over a nineteen-month period. Their participation in a series of TILT workshops was video taped, they were interviewed after each workshop and visited in their schools. Data collected from interviews were transcribed and together with observations of the workshops and classroom visits provided a rich source of information for close analysis. Close analysis wad conducted using a process of categorisation of data into themes and issues. The picture emerging from this process, although interesting, revealed little new about teacher learning. However when viewed through a cybernetic leans a different picture emerged. Following extensive reading in the literature dealing with cybernetics, emotion and cognition the data were then examined a second time using a cybernetics lens in order to answer the research questions. A theory of learning emerged out of this process that is grounded in the learning of two teachers. As well as providing answers to the research questions this grounded theory of learning has implications for program development and the success of teacher learning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex differences in spatial cognition: an evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Neilson, James</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with investigating causal explanations for the observed patterns of sex differences in spatial cognition. Researchers in this area have traditionally reported a male advantage in many spatial tasks, particularly mental rotation. However, a number of more recent results suggest that the pattern of sex differences in spatial ability is more complicated: females show a spatial memory advantage on some tasks involving large arrays of objects, and navigational tasks seem to reveal sex differences in attentional bias toward different types of spatial information. After reviewing three main types of causal explanations, it is concluded that the evolutionary approach has at least two compelling advantages. Firstly, it is inherently multi-disciplinary, and readily incorporates both biological-proximal and social-developmental explanations, as these mechanisms are integral to the expression of evolved traits. Secondly, it not only fits the available data, but provides a framework for generating novel theories and predictions; indeed, Silverman and Eals (1992) used an evolutionary model of sex differences in spatial ability &#65533; the &#65533;hunter-gather model, based on the sexual division of labour hypothesized to underlie hominid foraging and navigational requirements &#65533; to successfully predict the previously unobserved female advantage on certain object array tasks. Thus the primary aim of this thesis is to expand the hunter-gatherer model by further examining the computational demands placed on spatial ability in ancestral humans, and by making increasingly focused predictions about the cognitive skills underlying sex differences in spatial performance. Following a detailed discussion of these computational demands, it is argued that male-typical hunting as foraging strategy is associated with long range survey-based wayfinding, which requires the allocentric encoding of spatial relationships and enhanced sensitivity to coordinate information such as distance, based on the use of external geometric reference points. By contrast, it is argued that female-typical gathering as a foraging strategy is associated with sort range route-based wayfinding, which requires the ability to encode relational egocentric-categorical information about a large number of objects, but does not require enhanced sensitivity to categorical information. In order to examine this proposed model, several different spatial tasks are used and devised, with the aim of measuring sex differences in bias and sensitivity toward different types of spatial information. In all cases the computational demands of the task are related to the computational demands hypothesised to underlie hunting and gathering. Examples of manipulations of established tasks include variations on mental rotation (including measurements of the effects of angular distance), object array tasks, object recognition, categorical and coordinate sensitivity tasks, the judgement of line angle and position, and the tilt categorical and coordinate sensitivity tasks, the judgement of line angle and position, and the tilt illusion. Examples of novel lower-level tasks designed to measure the skills underlying mental rotation and object location memory include a rapid object array task, a judgement of vertical, and a judgement of parallelism. In almost all cases, results showed strong support for the hypotheses, and in some cases the novel tasks produced extremely large sex differences in the predicted direction. Basically, males show a clear advantage in sensitivity to coordinate information when external geometric reference points are available; furthermore, they are able to encode that information allocentrically, which allows the formation of spatial representations with the property of space constancy. Females show a clear advantage in object-to-position assignment based on egocentric-categorical encoding of a large number of relational positions. However, as anticipated, the female advantage seems to be limited to encoding capacity, and does not extend to sensitivity to categorical spatial information. Conclusions offer support for the use of evolutionary psychology as a tool in generating theorectical and experimental development. While further research is required to investigate the biological implementation and developmental mechanisms underlying the observed sex differences, it is hoped that this thesis contributes to the hunter-gatherer model of spatial ability, and more generally to the field of sex differences in cognition.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning with new tools</field><field name="creator">Coupland, Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a theoretical framework derived from activity theory to investigate the introduction of computer algebra systems (CAS) in first year university mathematics subjects. Both qualitative and quantitative data relevant to a case study of a group of approximately one hundred students, and two academics, were collected and analysed using a range of methods. The major question for this study was: What are the socio-cultural dynamics of learning with a new tool? More specifically, there are three questions: first, how do students in a particular context respond to their initial experience with a CAS as part of their first year mathematics subjects? Second, what relationships exist between aspects of students personal histories, their goals for mathematical learning, and the range of experiences they report concerning using a CAS for the first time? Third, in a particular case in a particular setting, how do academics see their role in the introduction of computer algebra systems into mathematics teaching? The main findings include the identification of the critical nature of purpose, or multiple motivating objects in activity systems. Personal identity as a learner of mathematics is constructed through choosing to engage at surface or deep levels, alone or with others. Students with a low level of computing background who had a high level of engagement and sense of purpose in their mathematical learning reported that they appropriated the new tool for their own personal use. Students with a high level of computing experience who were unable to form goals congruent with the learning tasks were less likely to appropriate the tool. In a similar way, lecturers with different purposes and different epistemological views of mathematics, in responding to contexts and personal goals, planned different teaching and learning experiences for their classes. The significance of this study is that it demonstrates how activity theory can be used successfully as a framework for an investigation that takes an expansive view of learning as a socio-cultural activity. Personal socio-cultural histories and motivations and social contexts influence students and academics as they form and reform their goals for engaging in learning and teaching activities. The study also highlights the gap between high school experiences of learning mathematics, dominated by rule following and the replication of pen and paper algorithms, and the more creative and challenging possibilities for making mathematics opened up by new technologies such as computer algebra systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a polymer-based, pro-apoptotic cancer therapeutic</field><field name="creator">Jones, Rachel A</field><field name="description">This thesis documents work directed towards the development of a novel cancer therapeutic that uses a synthetic polymer to deliver a pro-apoptotic peptide into the cytosol of cancer cells and in turn induce death by apoptosis. This was approached by (1) testing the ability of a range of synthetic polymers (poly(2-alkyl acrylic acid)s (PAAAs) and poly[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (pDMAEMA)) to facilitate the release of molecules from endosomes to the cytosol, (2) conjugating a pro-apoptotic peptide (Bad(140-165)) to a suitable endosomal-disruptive polymer, and (3) testing the ability of the polymer-peptide conjugate to enter the cytosol following endocytosis and to trigger apoptosis. PAAAs were shown to be endocytosed into cells and transported to late endosomes, where acidification of the lumen by the membrane H(superscript +)-ATPase triggered polymer-mediated vesicle disruption and release of endosomal contents to the cytosol. pDMAEMA was shown to induce rapid necrosis and to be endocytosed into cells where it induced morphological changes in late endosomes/lysosomes. However, pDMAEMA did not have the ability to disrupt endosomes, and was thus not used in further experiments. In addition, the very high toxicity of pDMAEMA could also pose a significant risk of bystander cell damage in cancer therapies. A hydrazide-linker (X) was synthesised and conjugated to PAAAs. Results showed that (1) the membrane disruptive ability of PAAAs was retained following conjugation with hydrazide linker, and (2) the carboxcyclic-hydrazide bond incorporated within the linker was stable at pH 7 but not at pH 5. Finally, PAAA-X was conjugated to Bad(140-165) to form PAAA-X-Bad(140-165). Immunofluorescence assays showed that PAAA-X-Bad(140-165) partially co-localised with early endosomes and induced disruption of endosomes and release of their contents into the cytosol in a time-dependent manner. Surprisingly, cell viability was retained following uptake of PAAA-X-Bad(140-165). The reasons why apoptosis was not induced following uptake of PAAA-X-Bad(140-165) are currently unknown, however possibilities include incomplete cleavage of the linker and/or insufficient release of Bad(140-165) into the cytosol. Future experiments, such as increasing the number of linkers and/or Bad(140-165) molecules attached to molecules of PAAA, may aid in the understanding of why apoptosis was not induced. As an adjunct to studies of the effects of polymers and PAAA-X-Bad(140-165) on cells, a new technique was developed to measure mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in intact cells. In this method, calcein is introduced into cells by pinocytic loading. Polarised mitochondria are visualised as darkened voids within a bright green fluorescent cytosol. MPT is measured as an in-filling of calcein fluorescence into these darkened voids. This method is free of disadvantages associated with earlier developed techniques and will be valuable in studies of MPT in intact cells. However, unfortunately, technical limitations prevent the use of this method to measure MPT in cells undergoing apoptosis. Taken together, results presented in this thesis provide a firm foundation for the future development of a novel cancer therapeutic that (1) directly targets cancer cells, (2) induces apoptotic death, and (3) avoids disadvantages associated with traditional cancer therapeutics.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing counter-histories of the Americas: Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac Of The Dead</field><field name="creator">Moylan-Brouff, Glenda</field><field name="description">This thesis stages a critical interrogation of the colonial politics that have shaped and continue to shape representations of Native Americans in a North American context. This critical interrogation is based on a reading of Leslie Marmon Silko's landmark text Almanac Of The Dead. I argue that Silko's deployment of Native American counter-discourses of history and story-telling contests Eurocentric epistemologies and ideologies and their entrenched colonial relations of power/knowledge. In the course of this thesis, I focus on the complex representational economies that constitute Silko's text in order to draw attention to Native American histories of resistance to material and symbolic practices of colonialism. Silko's text, I argue, is distinguished by an extraordinary range of representational practices that cut across Eurocentric epistemological categories and taxonomies. Drawing on a rich repertoire of genres and cultural practices -- including the novel, history, photography, the almanac, political manifesto, prophecy and oral story-telling -- Silko effectively challenges dominant, Eurocentric representations of Native Americans whilst, importantly, staging a project of cultural and historical reclamation. The complexity of Silko's text, I argue, cannot be appreciated unless it is contextualised within the colonial economies of power/knowledge that have shaped the Americas post the invasion of 1492 and the tactics of resistance maintained by Native Americans in the face of ongoing colonial practices. As such, throughout the course of this thesis, I rigorously map the complex intertextual relations that constitute the fabric of Silko's text. At every level of her text, I conclude, Silko stages contestatory interventions that challenge and critique dominant colonial systems of representation whilst simultaneously marking, re-articulating and valorising Native American epistemologies and cosmologies that overturn these same colonial systems.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wanderer's Guilt-Burden</field><field name="creator">Lees, John</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the male Wanderer figure by prominent writers of the Romantic Period - in prose, poetry, and in their self-portrayals. The major texts which it examines are: Godwin's St Leon (1799); Wordsworth's The Prelude (1805) and The Excursion (1814); Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812-1818); Polidori's The Vampyre (1819); and Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). By focussing on the Wanderer's guilt-burden - an essential element in these constructions - it shows to what extent the Wanderer reflected the social conscience of his time. To that end, the thesis argues that the guilt borne by the Wanderer of the Romantic Period was primarily a guilt-burden of privilege. The burden of a social conscience is what made the Wanderer pertinent to an age with egalitarian aspirations. It was this guilt-burden which lent the figure its vitality and significance. In that sense, the Wanderer of the Romantic Period should not be considered merely as a type or version of the Wandering Jew; rather, the figure was primarily a secular construction which, if anything, replaced the religious guilt of the older myth with the increasing social concerns of that revolutionary age.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of metal transfer and fusion using current control in dip transfer GMAW</field><field name="creator">Dean, Gary</field><field name="description">This research sets out to explore the mass and thermal transfer mechanisms involved in gas metal arc welding. This analysis was undertaken to enable improved process control strategies to be developed and evaluated. As a result of the investigations a new current control approach is proposed for dip transfer GMAW for use with conventional primary inverter power sources. This new control approach offers improved spatter reduction and fusion control compared to conventional constant voltage control systems. The control approach is based on the premise that if optimum droplet transfer conditions exist, then the short circuit current can be minimized through clamping, the droplet transfer taking place primarily under the influence of surface tension. Unlike previous controlled dip transfer strategies this approach places no reliance on pre-emptive detection of the short circuit rupture or on rapid peak current reduction. Novel adaptive control and monitoring techniques have been developed to assist in assessing the degree to which current clamping is introduced to the process, as well as identifying the type and degree of spatter generated. A study of optimized welding conditions has identified a relationship of use for the selection of welding parameters. The study led to the derivation of a hypothesis that defines the optimum short-circuiting event for droplet transfer. The investigation of the welding process has also identified inherent process irregularities when using CO2 shielding gas, which has led to the development of control strategies whose actions minimize the affect and enhance the welding process stability. To validate the proposed control approach a DSP based power source controller was designed and built. A comprehensive experimental program gave quantitative indication of the benefits likely to be achieved in practical welding situations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing civilisation: the historical novel in the Colombian national project</field><field name="creator">Cabrera, Marta Jimena</field><field name="description">This analysis of four selected Colombian historical novels of the nineteenth-century explores textual modes of self-fashioning in the process of nation building (individual and collective fashioning). To do this a methodology has been employed which entwines literary, political history and cultural studies. Based mainly on textual discourse analysis, it includes applications of literary theory (the role of the historical novel, Angel Ramas notion of the lettered city, the New Historicist notion of self-fashioning and Mikhail Bakhtins concept of classical and grotesque bodies). It also works with sociology of culture (Norbert Elias notion of civilisation process and Pierre Bourdieus distinction), history of ideas (Michel Foucaults concept of governmentality and technologies of the self), and historiography specific to the Colombian nineteenth century. The chosen texts for study are Yngermina o la hija de Calamar (1844) by Juan Jos&#65533; Nieto; El &#65533;ltimo rei de los muiscas (1864) by Jes&#65533;s Silvestre Rozo; Los jigantes (1875) by Felipe P&#65533;rez and Los piratas en Cartagena (1886) by Soledad Acosta de Samper. They were selected for having being published in different phases of the period of liberal hegemony in Colombia until the onset of conservatism and because their fictional settings cover different periods of Colombian history (the pre-Hispanic past, conquest, colony and independence). The analysis focuses on the way the writer constructs simultaneously a textual self-identity in consonance with collective identity emphasising issues of subjectivity, governmentality, space and the body and identifying the strategies employed in the construction of these identities. Thus, a reading of Yngermina o la hija de Calamar shows how Juan Jos&#65533; Nieto simultaneously constructed himself as a liberal Romantic denouncing the abuse of power and possessed of a romantic history as site of civilisation. Similarly, Jes&#65533;s Silvestre Rozo fashioned himself as a liberal Romantic in El &#65533;ltimo rei de los muiscas (1864) while relying on nostalgia to recreate a heroic past for the nation. In the case of Felipe P&#65533;rez, his radical liberal ideology and his experience as geographer produces in Los jigantes (1875) a nation conceived as an ensemble of regions and peoples destined for freedom and equality. Finally, Soledad Acosta de Samper is able to construct herself as a learned female historian in Los piratas en Cartagena (1886) in a time of constraints on the production and reception of women&#65533;s writing while also producing a conservative image of the nation as a Catholic, Hispanophile social body.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some analytical solutions for problems involving highly frictional granular materials</field><field name="creator">Thamwattana, Ngamta</field><field name="description">Granular materials are extensively used throughout many industries. In countries like Australia and South Africa, national economies are critically dependent on the agricultural and mining industries, and it is important to understand bulk material behaviour in order to handle these materials properly. There are many diverse approaches to modelling granular materials. In this thesis, the Coulomb-Mohr continuum mechanical theory of granular materials is utilised, and some exact analytical solutions are presented for both stress and velocity fields. These solutions are formally valid provided sin? = 1, where ? is the angle of internal friction, and they provide limiting solutions for so called highly frictional granular materials, for which sin? &#65533; 1. The solutions so obtained are exploited for three real industrial granular problems, namely gravity flow from converging hoppers, the stress distribution in stockpiles and finally, the stress distribution within rat-holes. The flow of granular materials, in the presence of gravity, through a converging hopper is an important problem that occurs in many industrial processes. Here, for highly frictional granular materials for both wedge and conical hopper flows, exact analytical solutions are obtained to determine the stress and velocity fields within the neighborhood of the hopper outlet. For the same problem, these exact solutions are exploited as the leading order terms in a regular perturbation series, where the correction terms are of order 1 - sin?. In this way, approximate analytical solutions are obtained that can be used to describe the behaviour of more realistic granular materials. The practice of storing granular materials in stockpiles occurs throughout the world in many industrial situations. In this thesis, exact solutions for highly frictional granular materials are used for the determination of the stress distributions within two-dimensional and axially symmetric stockpiles. Stockpile profiles considered here include the standard wedge and cone, as well as two-dimensional parabolic and axially symmetric cubic curved shaped stockpiles. We emphasise that curved stockpiles have not previously been considered in the literature. Our model assumes that the stockpile is composed of two regions, namely an inner rigid region and an outer yield region. The exact solution applies in the outer yield region, which is then extended continuously into the inner rigid region. A rat-hole is the general term used to describe those stable cavities, which frequently occur in storage hoppers and stockpiles, whose formation prevents further material falling through the outlet. In this thesis, we present exact solutions for both two-dimensional and axially symmetric rat-holes, where it is assumed that the highly frictional granular material has flowed through a central outlet, until the point is reached when there is no further flow of material. The remaining material is assumed to be in limiting equilibrium, that is static but on the point of yield. In both two dimensions and axial symmetry, two types of rat-holes are studied. The first type has a sloping upper surface of infinite extent, where the material is resting on a sloping rigid base containing an infinitesimal central outlet. The second type has a curved upper surface, where the material is resting between vertical walls and a horizontal rigid plane containing an infinitesimal central outlet. Again, we emphasise that neither of these rat-hole problems have previously been investigated in the literature.

Quenched and tempered (QT) steels, which are commonly used for transportable pressure vessels, require mandatory postweld heat treatment (PWHT) regardless of the plate thickness. During their life transportable pressure vessels may have up to four PWHT cycles, and concerns have emerged about possible effects on material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, impact toughness and fracture toughness.This thesis reports on the weld procedure, microstructural evaluation and various mechanical properties (bend, yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, fatigue, impact toughness, CTOD fracture toughness and hardness) for 11 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm QT steel weldments. The 11 mm and 20 mm base plates investigated were BIS80PV, which is a pressure vessel grade steel. The 12 mm plate was BIS80, which is structural grade steel but deemed a possible candidate for pressure vessels due to superior impact and fracture toughness properties over currently used QT pressure vessel steels. The parent metal, heat affected zone and weld metal regions of each weldment were examined, and then exposed to temperatures and times in the PWHT range.Although there was no apparent change in microstructure at an optical level and little change in hardness for up to four postweld heat treatments, there was a marked decrease in hardness of the parent metal for more extensive heat treatments (increasing Holloman parameter). There was also evidence of minor secondary hardening in the 11 mm and 20 mm BIS80PV parent plate following short heat treatment times. The weld metal (WM) and HAZ hardness typically decreased with one PWHT cycle and subsequently stabilised with further PWHT cycles.For all test plates, results are also presented for Charpy V-notch impact tests in the parent metal, HAZ and weld metal region, and CTOD fracture toughness tests in the PM region. The effect of exposure to multiple PWHT cycles on these properties is discussed. A decrease in impact energy and fracture toughness with an increase in the number of heat treatments was evident in the parent metal. In contrast, the weld metal showed a decrease in impact energy after two PWHT cycles, and then an increase towards the original impact energy after a further two cycles.In PM samples, which have been extensively tempered in the manufacturing process, the mechanism by which toughness properties are affected by cumulative PWHT holding time is through the coarsening and coalescence of second phase carbide particles. These particles decrease impact energy by the formation of larger voids in the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip or by the initiation of cleavage fracture. These two phenomena decrease the energy required for fracture.In WM with an as-solidified structure, ductile failure in the form of void coalescence is initiated by non-metallic inclusions. This leads to an initially high impact toughness, which then decreases after PWHT because of the nucleation and coarsening of metastable Fe3C precipitates that promote quasi-cleavage type fracture. Upon exposure to further PWHT cycles the impact energy begins to increase again due to the dissolution of the metastable carbides and the formation of finer, more stable carbides based on elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Nb. This change in the form of the carbide promotes localised fracture by micro-plasticity, with void formation and coalescence.Additionally, cross-weld root bend (180&#176;) and tensile tests were carried out before and after PWHT. None of the bend samples showed any evidence of  cracking or tearing, hence confirming the ductility of the weldment. The tensile properties of the BIS80PV cross-weld samples complied with the Australian Standards, but the tensile properties of the BIS80 cross-weld samples only complied in the as-welded condition.Tensile properties of the PM showed no significant trends with the number of PWHT cycles and the fatigue crack growth rate increased slightly in relation to the number of PWHT cycles or PWHT holding time.One of the primary roles of PWHT is to reduce residual stresses caused by the welding process. Residual stress measurements using the hole drilling method were made to ascertain the need for PWHT. Residual stresses, measured in the weld centre-line by the hole drilling technique, were compressive along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and were no greater than 250 MPa (between 0.2-0.5 times the yield strength at room temperature). Although, the presence of residual stresses (tensile and compressive) of greater magnitude is not excluded, the residual stress measurements demonstrated that PWHT significantly reduced the magnitude of the residual stresses.The ability to predict the impact energy of a pressure vessel steel subjected to various cumulative PWHT holding times is beneficial to pressure vessel inspectors, who are misguidedly instructed to be wary of the mechanical properties of vessels after 6 hours of cumulative PWHT holding time. The original impact energy of the steel, which is determined by its chemical composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical treatment determines the cumulative PWHT time before the impact properties of the QT steel decrease below the specified 40 J limit at &#8211;20&#176;C. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed using an artificial neural network to predict the effect of PWHT time and other variables such as composition and test temperature on impact energy. This ANN model provides a valuable design tool for predicting impact toughness as a function of composition, heat treatment and testing conditions.Finally, the performance of BIS80 was evaluated and its superior impact  oughness and fracture toughness properties over BIS80PV were confirmed. However, the tensile properties of postweld heat-treated 12 mm BIS80 cross-weld samples did not comply with AS3597, the Australian Standard for QT steels; and the PM stress ratio exceeded the specified limit of 0.93. These &#8216;deficiencies&#8217; could be remedied by (i) discarding PWHT or (ii) using a high strength WM; and (iii) abandoning or relaxing the stress ratio requirement, which is of questionable significance, under conditions of high strain rate impact loading (road collision).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/464</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation of two dairy shed waste management systems in the Southern Highlands of NSW</field><field name="creator">Fyfe, Julian</field><field name="description">Rapid changes in regulation, catchment water quality, and public perception are the main driving forces towards more sustainable dairy farming in the Southern Highlands, NSW. A study was undertaken to assess the performance of two established waste management systems in terms of on-farm nutrient control/containment. The systems were installed in the mid-1990s as part of a pilot program to develop best management practice (BMP) pollution control techniques; however they are now considered to be below current BMP standards. The first was a treatment system consisting of stabilisation ponds and constructed wetlands designed to provide low-energy treatment before effluent is (legally) discharged into a creek. The second was a direct application to land system that irrigates raw wastewater onto a designated paddock throughout the year under all weather conditions. Seasonal monitoring of the ponds and wetland treatment system indicated effective pollutant removal throughout the year, achieving net pollutant removals of 94%, 87%, 93%, 67% and 25% for TSS, COD, BOD5, TKN and TP, respectively. A theoretical water balance revealed that addition of 4700 L/d of uncontaminated water was causing notable impairment to the removal efficiency of the system. The performance of the system was also inhibited by excessive sludge accumulation in the anaerobic pond stage, and deficient vegetation, algal growth and P saturation of the substrate in the constructed wetlands. Performance data from the ponds and wetlands were fitted to flow-adjusted first order complete-mix and plug flow models, respectively. Application of the Arrhenius temperature dependence equation revealed that removal of TSS, COD and BOD5 in the ponds was positively related to temperature (&#952; = 1.209, 1.182 and 1.126, respectively), while temperature had the converse effect on TS and COD removal in the wetlands (&#952; = 0.966 and 0.951, respectively). Disposal of the effluent from the treatment system is allowing the release of 350 kg/yr of nitrogen and 88 kg/yr of phosphorus directly into a natural creek, which is resulting in measurable degradation of water quality downstream of the discharge point. Upstream TKN and TP concentrations averaged 0.82 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, while downstream of the discharge the mean concentrations for the same parameters were 4.13 and 1.55 mg/L, respectively. Soil from the land application site was intensively sampled to obtain informative data on chemical properties as affected by effluent treatment. To facilitate the assessment an untreated site was sampled to provide comparative data from land that is utilised according to a typical pasture management regime. Surface runoff was also captured from both the effluent-treated (treated) and untreated sites to investigate nutrient export from the waste application site. The general outcome of the soil analyses was to show that wastewater application is positively affecting the available nutrient pool, but on the whole is exhibiting no greater impact on soil properties than other land use factors such as intensive stocking and pasture improvement. Significant increases in soil nutrient concentrations resulting from waste application were associated with more mobile plant-available nutrient species including extractable phosphorus, nitrate and potassium, which are mostly by-products from natural decomposition of the organic fraction of the applied waste. Otherwise, waste application had no bearing on the net nutrient status of the soil in terms of TP, TN, CEC, and organic matter. Runoff monitoring indicated that mean concentrations of all forms of nutrients were significantly higher in surface runoff from the treated site than in runoff from the untreated site. TKN, NH3-N, TP and DRP concentrations averaged 3.36, 0.77, 0.89 and 0.69 mg/L, respectively, from the untreated site, while the same parameters averaged 20.56, 8.60, 7.77 and 6.44 mg/L, respectively, on the treated site. Concentrations were related to rainfall quantity but not intensity indicating that mechanisms of desorption and dissolution governed nutrient export from effluent treated pasture. Thus contamination of surface runoff was indicative of short-term impacts related to direct wash-off of nutrients from applied waste rather than endemic problems associated with over enrichment of the receiving soil. The evaluation identified major shortcomings associated with the two forms of waste management system under review. Significant modifications to both systems are required in order to achieve complete nutrient containment as required to satisfy regulatory standards. Further research is recommended to determine whether adherence to best management practice (BMP) will prevent nutrient losses and to improve strategic distribution of the nutrient content of dairy shed waste.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the introduction of a pilot electronic health record system on general practitioners' work practices in the Illawarra</field><field name="creator">Spinks, Karolyn Annette</field><field name="description">This thesis assessed the impact of the use of information technology (IT), specifically, electronic health records (EHRs), on general practitioners' (GPs') clinical work practices in NSW, Australia. The research framework and context was taken from EHR initiatives proposed by the Australian Commonwealth and State Governments for improving the Australian Healthcare system. A new system that provided increased access to electronic patient information was trialed in the Illawarra Region of NSW specifically utilizing a Smart ID Information System. The current research was administered under this larger project. The current research examined the Smart ID Information System (a pilot system designed to emulate EHRs) so the impact of EHRs on GPs' work practices could be considered. GPs work practices are hindered partially because Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure is not yet available to support them in their need to easily exchange patient information. Consequently patient clinical information is sometimes unavailable because it involves a labour intensive process to obtain that information. In solving the above problems with EHRs other problems are created such as positive identification of patients and their results and records. Also, issues of the threat to patients: privacy and confidentiality are enormous. The research question is therefore: how are GPs' clinical work practices impacted by the introduction of EHRs and associated unique patient identifiers (UPIs)? The research methodology was both a quantitative and qualitative inquiry which focused on two aspects of the Smart ID Information System project. It was broken into two parts plus supplementary results from a closely related study were used as secondary data. Firstly, a perception study investigated GPs' perceptions of current and future accessibility to patient clinical information and what their needs were, for acceptance of EHRs in general practice. This study was achieved through interviewing GPs. Secondly, an observation study investigated how the adoption of EHRs in the form of a pilot EHR system (Smart ID Information System) impacted on GP clinical work practices through observation of GP work practices. Results from secondary data were included here and discussed in the conclusion. Results of the perception study showed GPs agreed there was a problem with the exchange of patient information and the information flow between health service providers. The GPs were generally willing to use IT (via EHRs) to improve their work efficiency. They believed EHRs could help provide a solution, which overcame the existing problem of lack of patient information. The GPs were keen to increase the amount of information exchanged. Overall the idea of the Smart ID Information System as a pilot EHR system was well received by the GPs interviewed but the GPs highlighted the pilot EHR system implemented must be simple to use. Results of the observation study showed GPs successfully used the pilot EHR system within their consulting environment. The GPs proved they could successfully access the patient's record, integrate this access procedure and subsequent discussion of the information with the patient, into the consultation whilst maintaining their autonomy for their personal routine and work practices. The GPs found the access and consent procedure facilitated via the I-keys was quick and simple to use despite slow system performance. Both consultations in which the system was used were longer. Results of follow-up interviews from secondary data indicated GPs were willing to accept the technology knowing the benefits they would gain from its use. Of the GPs interviewed one GP thought consultations were longer, a second GP thought the length of consultations stayed the same. In conclusion the research found GPs agreed their work practices were hindered by inefficiencies due to non-availability of patient clinical information, and any system to improve this efficiency must be simple to use. EHRs (and UPIs) have minimal impact on GPs work practices and GPs studied were reasonably comfortable with the impact EHRs have on their work practices but this is only if EHRs do not significantly lengthen consultation times, such an EHR system runs efficiently, and excellent infrastructure is in place to support GPs. Results relating to consultation length with EHRs were inconclusive due to some consultations staying the same and some becoming longer. However, there is a possibility consultation length will increase with EHRs due to increased availability of patient information and dependency on prevailing technology. The current research involved a direct GP / patient relationship. Future research of EHRs in general practice could include an extension of the current research to incorporate an indirect GP / patient relationship. This is where significant benefits lie for GPs and patients from using EHRs. Another suggestion of future research could be the impact of EHRs and UPIs on the work practices of practice management staff, including receptionists and practice nurses working in GP's surgeries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosing childhood sexual assault in close relationships : the meanings and emotions women associate with their experiences and their lives now</field><field name="creator">Maitland, Hilary Anne</field><field name="description">This research aimed to explore women&#8217;s meanings and emotions associated withdisclosing childhood sexual assault within close relationships and their current life experiences. A personal construct model of the disclosure process was examined, which proposed that disclosing childhood sexual assault will impact on women&#8217;s meaning making, their willingness to tell, and their close relationships.Participants were twenty eight women between 20 and 60 years of age drawnfrom those accessing counselling or support groups. Twenty three women completed a questionnaire, provided narratives about their current life experiences and an importantdisclosure experience, and the Social Support Questionnaire (Sarason, Levine, Basham and Sarason, 1983). Eight women from a Survivors Support Group participated in a discussion about their disclosure experiences.Meanings women associated with their disclosure and current life experienceswere identified in individual narratives and the Support Group transcript. The emotional content of women&#8217;s narratives was examined using a qualitative approach and the content analysis scales of Anxiety, Hostility Directed Outward, Hostility Directed Inward, Ambivalent Hostility, Depression, Hope and Human Relations (Gottschalk and Bechtel, 2002), Positive Affect and Sociality (Viney, Caputi and Webster, 2000).Women&#8217;s recollections of their disclosure experiences and current life experiences contained meanings about self, others, self in relation to others and childhood sexual assault (supporting Hypothesis 1), evidence of invalidation, validationand reconstruction (supporting Hypothesis 2), and evidence of both negative andpositive emotions (anger, hostility, anxiety, fear, mixed emotions, guilt, shame, sadness/depression, love, pleasant emotions, and relief) supporting Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4 proposing a relationship between the meanings women gave to their experiences and their emotions was also supported. Hypothesis 5 proposing a positivecorrelation between women&#8217;s views of their current social networks and the emotions they experience was supported for positive emotions (these were positively associated with satisfying close relationships) but not for negative emotions.The implications of the research findings for both clinical practice and the widercommunity were explored. The application of the model to the broader community of people sexually assaulted as children was examined. Criticisms were made about the research, together with suggestions for future research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of the Indian ocean tsunami on peace in Sri Lanka and Aceh</field><field name="creator">Melecki, Meredith</field><field name="description">The 26 December 2004 tsunami was far reaching in its effects but the two areas most devastated by the tidal wave were the Indonesian province of Aceh and the country of Sri Lanka. These areas have much more than the impact of the tsunami disaster in common. They have both also been sites of decades-long violent conflicts that have compounded many of the problems caused by the tsunami. One result of the tsunami was an influx of NGOs into these two areas. NGOs, as promoters of development, have increasingly been associated with activities deemed necessary to the creation of peace. This stems from an understanding in the fields of development and peace and conflict resolution that not only does war undermine development, but that the cause of internal wars can be linked to failures of development. Therefore, the role of NGOs is important when examining efforts at peace creation in Sri Lanka and Aceh since the occurrence of the tsunami. In this thesis I have focused on Oxfam International and CARE International which are two of the largest international NGOs acting in both Sri Lanka and Aceh. In undertaking this assessment I aim to consider the ways in which NGOs may have impacted the resumption or resolution of conflict in Sri Lanka and Aceh, and whether or not NGOs have played a role in the differing outcomes of the wars in these areas. To undertake this investigation I first present an overview of the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Aceh. This includes an inspection of the historical, economic, and political elements that have been contributed to the origination of each conflict. This is followed by an exploration of development theories and theories of peace and conflict resolution, focusing on the ways in which the situations of Sri Lanka and Aceh support or contradict arguments from these fields. I then examine the literature concerned with NGOs in order to present a thorough consideration of the pros and cons associated with NGOs in both conflict situations and the creation of peace before I review and evaluate NGO activities in Sri Lanka and Aceh subsequent to the tsunami disaster. In the course of writing this thesis I have found that many of the advantages and disadvantages emblematic of NGO involvement in conflict and post-conflict situations are currently present in Sri Lanka and Aceh. However, NGOs in Sri Lanka have been associated with fewer of the drawbacks identified with non-governmental organisations in conflict situations than NGOs in Aceh. If the proposition that NGOs can aid in peacemaking and peacebuilding is correct, we could therefore expect that in this situation NGOs have been more effective in Sri Lanka than Aceh. This highlights one of my primary findings which is that NGO activities addressing problems associated with underdevelopment cannot in themselves lead to the creation of peace. In fact, it seems that NGO efforts are merely an adjunct to endeavours to create peace.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the performance of FBG sensing system</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xingyuan</field><field name="description">The Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is a periodic perturbation of the refractive index inside the fiber formed by exposure of the fiber core to an intense optical interference pattern. The most important property of FBG is that it will reflect the incident light with particularly predetermined wavelengths, while passing all the other wavelengths of light at the same time. As the wavelength of the reflected light varies with the strain, temperature and other environmental factors, detection of the wavelength will yield information about these quantities. Recently, FBG has attracted much research and development effort due to their potential enormous potential of strain and temperature sensing in smart structures and polymeric materials, thereby several FBG sensing systems have been developed.This research aims to develop new approaches to improve the performance of FBG sensing system. Firstly, we have demonstrated a novel demodulation system based on wavelength-multiplexed FBG sensors and the Fabry-Perot (FP) tunable filter for measurement of vibration/dynamic strain. By using such a system, the restricted scanning frequency of FP tunable filter is overcome. Furthermore, signal processing methods are proposed to achieve more reliable and accurate measurement. In the experiment, program controlled multipoint dynamic strain detection is successfully implemented by this system. The second task involved in this research work is to develop signal processing methods for improving the measurement precision of FBG sensing system. In practical applications, various types of noise will occur that significantly limit the accuracy of wavelength detection. Therefore, proper signal processing method is required, especially for long-term applications. In this thesis, classical digital filter, adaptive digital filter and neural network were investigated to solve this problem.The last issue of this thesis is to improve the performance of the FBG sensing system which using intensity and wavelength-division multiplexing (IWDM) technique. IWDM technique has the advantages of low complexity and enabling the system to contain twice the number of FBGs as the conventional WDM technique. However, this technique requires long processing times to get high detection accuracy. In this chapter, three optimization algorithms: gradient algorithm, tabu search algorithm and tabu-gradient algorithm are developed to improve the performance of IWDM based FBG sensing system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The adoption and diffusion of internet-electronic data interchange (I-EDI) by Jordanian SMEs</field><field name="creator">Al-Bakri, Anas A</field><field name="description">Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a protocol that enables businesses to exchange information and business transactions via proprietary networks. The early application of traditional EDI was quickly supplanted by an Internet-based (Internet-EDI) version, as this is much cheaper and more flexible. This research explores both the factors influencing adoption as well as barriers preventing adoption of I-EDI by Jordanian companies, particularly those in the SME sector. These factors include Organizational, Inter-organizational, Technical, Cultural factors, Governmental factors, Perceived benefits, Triggers and Barriers. The research design was an explorative case study of Jordanian SMEs with data collected via interviews. The sample (participants) included a diverse range of companies, employing between 2 and 120 people. The participants of the research interviews came from six Jordanian companies (SME sector). The research was comprised of three stages: Theoretical Analysis (Stage One), Qualitative Data Collection (Stage Two) and Data Analysis and Interpretation (Stage Three). The analysis of primary data (phone interviews) revealed that many salient factors impacted I-EDI adoption. Benefits of I-EDI, Barriers to I-EDI, Organizational, Inter-organizational Factors, Cultural (Environmental), and Governmental Factors were presented as important issues for I-EDI adoption by the Jordanian SME sector, particularly Cultural and Governmental Factors. The research also shows that the global competitiveness of Jordanian SME may depend on how quickly they move forward to embrace I-EDI. Further research is necessary to better understand the status of the I-EDI adoption and diffusion among SMEs in Jordan and the impact of the factors identified here on performance and efficiency.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms, microtonality, performance: eleven musical compositions</field><field name="creator">Burt, Warren</field><field name="description">Following a lifetime of creative work and investigation into algorithmic composition and microtonality, I became interested in the speculative mathematical music theory of Ervin Wilson. Encountering his work spurred me on to further investigations in sound and tuning, in a series of compositions using electronic, acoustic, and robotic acoustic instruments. Tuning ideas developed by Wilson and others were extended and expanded into several families of new microtonal musical scales, which were used as the basis for composing a series of algorithmic real-time musical works of extended duration. Some of these works involved collaborative relationships with other musicians, hardware and software instrument designers, and scientists. Wilson&#8217;s ideas, such as Moments of Symmetry (MOS) scales, Euler-Fokker Genera, limit-ratios, the Scale Tree, and additive sequences and their derivation from number triangles, as well as other tuning ideas, such as permutations of the materials of the ancient Greek modal system were all extended and developed into families of interrelated microtonal scales. The desire to compose works of extended duration was aided by the large size of some of these scale families, which consist of between 60 and 276 new scales each. Acoustic instruments were built or adapted to perform some of these works, including microtonal plucked-string and percussion instruments, and the computer-controlled microtonal instruments of Godfried Willem Raes at the Logos Foundation, in Gent, Belgium. Other works used electronic timbres designed to explore placing of sound in space produced by the interaction of timbre, tuning and room acoustics. Software instruments designed to perform the algorithms used were developed in collaboration with John Dunn of Algorithmic Arts, in Fort Worth, Texas. Investigation into the role of timbre and tuning in sonification was carried out with the help of the Wollongong Room Calorimeter project, led by Professor Arthur Jenkins. This thesis discusses how these tunings, algorithms, real-time processes, instruments, and collaborative relationships were used in creating these compositions. Recordings of all compositions discussed are contained in the electronic Appendix, on the attached DVD-Rom. Catalogs of all scales used in the thesis, as well as Scala files for all scales, and all data used in composing the pieces is also contained in the Appendix.

Despite the concomitant attention of ecologists and invasion biologists, our empirical understanding of the impacts and mechanisms of exotic plant invasion remains rudimentary and fragmented and further complicated by species and site specific effects. Exotic plant invasion is of paramount concern in Australia due to the high species endemism and the recent settlement of Europeans (in 1788) which has been paralleled by vast, rapid modification of the landscape. Large expanses of land have subsequently been cleared for agriculture, residential and industrial areas and many exotic species have been introduced, both intentionally and accidentally. As a result, exotic species invasion has become an issue of national significance. In attempt to further our ecological understanding of the impacts, and macro and micro-mechanisms of exotic plant invasion, I have focused my research on the bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera spp. rotundata (DC.) T. Norl.) invasion of the eastern Australian coastal dune systems. Bitou bush has been declared Australia's sixth worst weed based on its invasibility and impacts on the environment. However there is a paucity of quantitative evidence to support these claims with substantiation being primarily anecdotal. Therefore I aimed to investigate the plant demographic impacts and soil chemistry changes imposed by the invasion and determined whether allelopathy and indirect soil chemical interference are mechanisms facilitating bitou bush invasion in Australia. The demographic response of indigenous plants to the invasion of exotic woody plants has rarely been quantified. I therefore aimed to determine which life history stages of three indigenous plant species: Correa alba var. alba (Andrews; Rutaceae), Monotoca elliptica ((Sm.) R.Br.; Epacridaceae) and Lomandra longifolia (Labill.; Lomandraceae), were more susceptible to the invasion of bitou bush. I also assessed whether various morphological and physiological parameters of the mature stage of these species were affected by the presence of bitou bush. Populations of all three indigenous species in bitou bush invaded habitats had significantly fewer small individuals and a lower population density than populations in non-invaded habitats. The mean flower production, growth, ratio of reproductive: vegetative buds and physiological stress of mature individuals of each of these species in bitou bush invaded habitat did not differ from those in the non-invaded habitat. However, the flower production of C. alba was significantly more variable in the bitou bush invaded habitat which suggested plasticity in resource allocation in response to the invasion. Increased trait variability was not found for M. elliptica and L. longifolia suggesting mature plant tolerance to the new neighbour. We therefore propose that bitou bush affected indigenous plant populations primarily by preventing recruitment through the germination or seedling growth stages and that older plants typically tolerated the presence of the exotic. The reduction in indigenous plant recruitment is likely to create space that would facilitate bitou bush monoculture formation in the new host environment. A more detailed assessment of the physiological health of mature indigenous plants in invaded habitats was conducted to determine whether there was seasonal effect of the invasion. The photosynthetic efficiency of plants was adopted as an indicator of physiological health. The seasonal photosynthetic patterns of C. alba, M. elliptica and L. longifolia in invaded and non-invaded habitats were assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence. I also examined whether bitou bush altered the habitat physico-chemical parameters which may have lead to any observed changes in the physiological health of mature individuals. All three species exhibited photosynthetic maxima during winter and minima in summer, in contrast to most other Northern hemisphere studies on seasonal photosynthetic patterns. Winter photosynthetic maxima are likely to be facilitated by the autumn rains and cooler winter temperatures of the eastern Australian coast. Differences in the photosynthetic capacity of individuals of all three species among different sites were also detected. Although the invasion of bitou bush significantly altered the canopy cover of C. alba and M. elliptica and moderated the ground level microclimate, I detected no effect on the seasonal photosynthetic patterns of the three species studied, suggesting physiological tolerance to the invasion by mature plants. The reductions in ground incident light and daily maximum temperatures associated with the invasion were likely to be responsible for the reduction in variability of Fv/Fm (physiological stress parameter) detected in autumn for all species. Therefore, I suggest that the photosynthetic patterns of Australian native plants is a function of seasonal climatic and site variability, which was not significantly affected by the microhabitat changes induced by the invasion of bitou bush. Chemical interference is increasingly suggested as a mechanism facilitating exotic plant invasion. I therefore devised a comprehensive bioassay technique that promoted detection and differentiation of phytotoxicty, allelopathy and indirect soil effects of exotic plants by comparing extract inhibition with that of a dominant indigenous plant. Comparison of the bioactivity of comparable extracts from plant parts and soil was integral to the technique. Hydrophilic to hydrophobic solvent extracts of indigenous acacia and exotic bitou bush leaves and roots all exhibited differential phytotoxic effects on a range of indigenous plants. Chemical interference, or allelopathy, between co-evolved plants was found by the hydrophobic extracts of the roots and soil of acacia against a sedge, Isolepis nodosa (Rott.) R. Br. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic extracts of the roots and soil from the exotic bitou bush elicited allelopathic effects against four indigenous species. Additionally, the hydrophobic soil extracts of bitou bush inhibited the germination and growth of Banksia integrifolia and A. longifolia var. sophorae, while the acacia soil extract inhibited the germination of B. integrifolia and Lomandra longifolia. Therefore I suggest that both the indigenous acacia and exotic bitou bush have the potential to chemically inhibit the establishment of indigenous plants, with an additive effect. Eventual monoculture formation by bitou bush is likely to be facilitated by allelopathy against indigenous species and the residual soil inhibition of dominant A. longifolia var. sophorae establishment. To determine whether bitou bush exuded novel compounds into the soil that were not present in the acacia dominated indigenous system, I compared the root and soil chemical profiles of these species. I focused on the hydrophobic extracts of the roots and soil as these were found to be most inhibitory in the laboratory based bioassays. Using solvent based extraction and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, I detected three compounds that were exclusive to the bitou bush root and soil, and seven compounds that were common to the bitou bush and acacia roots but only present in the bitou bush soil. The compounds unique to the bitou bush invaded soil were all sesqui- and diterpenes. Several of these compounds were found to inhibit the seedling growth of a native sedge, Isolepis nodosa. Of particular interest were the sesquiterpenes: &#946;-maaliene, &#945;-isocomene, &#946;-isocomene, &#948;-cadinene, 5-hydroxycalamenene and 5-methoxycalamenene which were found in high concentrations in the bitou bush root and soil and exhibited phytotoxic activity. To confirm that bitou bush alters the soil chemistry of the sand dunes of the eastern Australian coast, we also designed a novel technique to assess the field soil chemical profile. The technique employed adsorbent resin filled bags intended to trap hydrophobic compounds in-situ which were then tested for bioactivity in the laboratory. I compared the hydrophobic chemical profile of soil below bitou bush and acacia to that of unvegetated soil. Similar GC profiles were found to those detected via the solvent extraction method; however, the resin bag technique showed that the alkane series was present in both the bitou bush and acacia soils. Using the resin bag technique, the chemical profile of the bitou bush invaded soil was characterised by a high concentration of sesquiterpenes and was distinct from the indigenous plant soil and bare sand, which were similar except for the presence of a higher concentration of phenolic compounds in the acacia soil and a higher concentration of hexadecanoic acid in the un-vegetated soil. Bioassays of these hydrophobic mixtures showed that the soil inhabited by plants, whether exotic or native, was inhibitory to the growth of an indigenous sedge, compared to the unvegetated soil. Based on the series of experiments conducted, and described above, I suggest that the bitou bush invasion of the eastern Australian coast is likely to affect the recruitment limitation of indigenous species, rather than effects on fecundity and mature plant health. Bitou bush was found to induce a unique soil hydrochemical chemical profile, via two different techniques, which was characterised by high concentrations of several sesquiterpenes and low concentrations of a phenolic compound compared to the acacia profile. Although hydrophobic extracts both the bitou bush and acacia soils inhibited the growth of some indigenous species, the bitou bush inhibited more, including the dominant acacia, which is likely to result in the creation of vacant space and increased opportunities for bitou bush establishment and hence proliferation. Therefore, I suggest that allelopathy is a key mechanism driving the recruitment limitation of indigenous flora and invasion of bitou bush on the eastern Australian coast.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of embedded sensors to assess the fatigue response of adhesive joints in marine environments.</field><field name="creator">McGovern, Scott</field><field name="description">Historically, the use of adhesives within the marine industry has been limited due to the effects that salt water can have on the adhesive joint in service. Salt water has been shown to have adverse effects on the adhesive bond strength due to corrosion of the adherend surfaces, delamination of the adhesive at the interface and plasticisation of the adhesive material. However, if the progress of such degradation can be properly monitored and better understood then greater confidence may be imparted with the use of adhesives for marine structures, and with adhesive incorporation, the potential benefits of improved weight reduction, speed of manufacture and reduced cost may be realised. The work in this thesis was undertaken to develop miniature sensors that may be embedded within the adhesive bondline so that a continual health monitoring of the adhesive joint in service may be undertaken and a better understanding of the mechanisms of adhesive breakdown in marine environments may be achieved. Sensor substrates were manufactured from 125 &#65533;m polyester insulated platinum wires dip coated with conducting polymer materials. Various conducting polymers were investigated for their ability to sense localised environmental conditions such as the presence of water and pH changes - recognised factors that have been linked to adhesive joint degradation via the instigation of adhesive plasticisation / delamination or the onset of corrosion. Humidity sensors were manufactured from polyaniline (PAn) based materials due to the high conductivity changes observed with PAn in the presence of water. The best response was obtained from the polymer blend that was manufactured by chemically polymerising aniline monomer using ammonium persulphate in the presence of poly butylacrylate -covinyl acetate (P(BuA-co-VAc)) and camphor sulfonic acid (HCSA) to generate a solid that could be readily dissolved in dichloromethane. A blend of 15 w/w% PAn was developed and a portion of the PAn polymer solid was further de-protonated from the emeraldine salt (ES) to the emeraldine base (EB) form to be applied as a protective barrier layer. Sensors were constructed by first dip-coating the substrate in 15 w/w% PAn P(BuA-co- VAc) ES polymer followed (after drying) by dip-coating in 15 w/w% PAn P(BuA-co-VAc) EB polymer. The sensors had an exponential response and showed high sensitivities with an 800% resistance change over the entire 95% change in RH. For the largest change in humidity (from 3 to 95% RH) the sensors took approximately 4 to 5 hours to reach 90% of the equilibrium resistance on humidifying and 35 hours was required to reach 90% of the equilibrium resistance upon desiccation. The best pH sensors were manufactured from a processable polymer blend made from poly 3,4 -diethoxythiophene (PEDT) and poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The blend was able to be cast from an acetone solvent and had an approximate PEDT content of 11w/w%. The sensors showed a linear response to pH changes between 5 and 11 with an approximate 350% increase in resistance when increasing the pH from 1 to 13. However, hysteresis was observed with cycling between high and low pH and significant drift was encountered when cycling over multiple cycles. Further problems were also encountered with the embedding of the sensor in the Araldite 2015 test adhesive, and as such these sensors were abandoned from further study. To examine the humidity sensor performance in service, Aluminium 5083 Araldite 2015 adhesive joints were constructed in a lap-shear configuration, comparing two different pretreatments of an Optimised FES (FES) and an acetone solvent wipe (solvent wipe). Joints were exposed to a constant temperature salt water spray and the lap-shear tensile strength of the adhesive joints was tested after varied time of exposure for joints with and without embedded sensors and for both pre-treatment types. For the same salt water exposure conditions, joints were also exposed to a constant 1 Hz fatigue cycle with a varied load and S-N curves were generated for joints with and without sensors for both pre-treatments. It was found that the average dry tensile strength of the solvent wipe and FES joints was 10.3 +/- 1.3 MPa and 16.2 +/- 0.3 MPa respectively. The tensile strength of the solvent wiped joints showed a steady decrease with exposure to salt water spray such that after 21 days exposure time, joint strengths had dropped to 50% of the strength of the unexposed samples. In comparison, the FES samples showed no loss in joint strength even after 23 days exposure to salt water spray. The difference in joint performance between the two pretreatments was attributed to the high degree of surface roughness of the FES treated samples enabling a greater degree of mechanical interlock between the adhesive and substrate. Solvent wiped joints that were tested in fatigue showed a marked decrease in strength when exposed to marine conditions. It was shown that for the same applied fatigue loads joints that were tested 'dry' lasted approximately 50 times longer than joints that were exposed to a salt water spray. This dramatic change was somewhat uniform across the whole S-N curve even for short exposure times less than 1 day and this accelerated decay of joint strength was attributed to the generation of micro-cracks during the fatigue process that allowed for the faster ingress of water into the joint further accelerating the breakdown seen with static tests. The greater strength with the FES joints was further highlighted with the fatigue tests. When exposed to marine conditions, the FES joints were seen to last up to 10,000 times longer than solvent wiped joints and no failure was seen with the 'dry' FES joints at allwithin the constraints of the testing apparatus. The 10 million cycle fatigue strength of the FES joints exposed to marine conditions was estimated to be approximately 1.3MPa. It was hoped that the embedded sensors may be used to ascertain a critical water content within each of the adhesive systems that might suggest the onset of adhesive failure, however it was seen that the embedded sensors became unstable between 24 and 48 hours of exposure to salt water. The change in stability of the embedded sensor with static tests was seen after water uptake in the adhesive of 2 w/w%, analogous to an equilibrated environment of approximately 75% relative humidity. It was thought that for each of the tests the sensor breakdown was most likely due to a combination of three main factors: a) swelling of the adhesive with water ingress, promoting delamination of the sensing polymer from the underlying sensor substrate b) further deprotonation of the underlying ES sensing material to that of the nonconducting PAn EB c) the generation of micro cracks and internal strains within the adhesive system (especially within the fatigue tests) that mechanically affected the performance of the embedded sensor response It was discovered that with full immersion of Araldite 2015 adhesive films in water, the maximum uptake of water that was achievable was approximately 6 w/w% taking over 6 weeks to reach full stability. Due to the short time frame encountered before sensor breakdown in static tests of 24 - 48 hours it could be concluded that a) is not the most likely cause of sensor failure. Likewise c) is less likely due to the absence of any applied external stress during salt water exposure during static tests. It may be postulated then, that if b) is the likely cause of sensor breakdown, the sudden change in environmental conditions that could initiate a net increase in resistance (andreduction in the perceived mass uptake of water) by means of deprotonation would be an increase in pH - similar to what is known to occur at the onset of corrosion. In the current study there were indications that corrosion had been initiated with ingress of water equivalent to 75% RH at the site of the sensor (causing this increase in resistance) and may help explain the significant drop in fatigue strength that was seen with the solvent wiped joints after only 1 day exposure.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outlaws and their mortgages: an analysis of the Property (Relationships) Act 1984 (NSW)</field><field name="creator">Cahill, Erin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the Property (Relationships) Act 1984 (NSW) (the PRA). This piece of legislation instituted what was, at the time, the most progressive and furthest reaching recognition of same sex relationships within the Australian legislative system. Whilst recognising the important implications of the PRA, there are two remarkable features of this legislation upon which this thesis focuses. First, it instituted a legally sanctioned hierarchy of relationship types within Australian law, in terms of legal rights and enablement. Marriage sits at the top of this hierarchy, governed at both the state and the federal levels in Australia. This is followed by heterosexual de facto relationships under NSW state law and then same sex de facto couples within the same jurisdiction. The second notable feature of the PRA is that its usage within the higher ranks of the NSW court system has been relatively limited. Specifically, there are no cases, in the court setting, of lesbian couples using the PRA. This thesis approaches these two issues by characterising the existence and effects of the PRA as contradictory. The PRA enables lesbians within the legal system in the same moment that it contains and prevents the application of full legal citizenship. It argues that the PRA produces a symbolic (homosexual) legislative figure characterised by contradiction in terms of legal coverage, citizenship rights and basic appearance in law. It argues too that although the gender neutral definition of de facto that the PRA produced allows same sex relationships to be recognised under NSW law, the Act also limits its applicability to same sex relationships (particularly lesbian ones). This thesis counter poses two theoretical approaches to exploring and explaining the PRA- liberal democratic theory and lesbian outlaw theory. It argues that liberal democratic explanations of laws and legal systems rely on a specific avoidance of articulating contradiction whilst simultaneously producing this effect. Liberal democratic theory takes account of contradiction only in so far as it represents a temporary failure of the application of liberal democracy itself. Conversely, lesbian outlaw theory is taken to explore contradiction as a fundamental characteristic of knowledge production. Lesbian outlaw theory is developed throughout this thesis as a feminist Foucaultian framework. The critique of binary logic by both feminists and Foucault enables an understanding of and a theoretical focus on contradiction that liberal democratic theory appears incapable of providing. Through such explorations of contradiction two common notions- silence and truth- appear. This thesis examines the PRA by locating the sites of truth and silence involved in its production (the writing process, the parliamentary debates and the advertising campaign) and in its application (through a series of interviews with women in long term lesbian relationships). The project of this thesis then, becomes an exploration of the ways in which liberal democratic theory shaped the production of the PRA and the ways in which lesbian outlaw theory can account for and address the ramifications of this. This thesis concludes that an outlaw interpretation of the PRA allows two primary things: the exploration of contradiction as a function and effect of the PRA and an encouragement of conceptualising this contradiction as productive in nature. This then has flow on effects to legal scholarship, which this thesis also explores. The thesis concludes that lesbian outlaw theory can influence legal theorising and practice in a manner that better accounts for the experiences of lesbians than does liberal democratic theory and hence advocates for its use in such a manner.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politics and book publishing in the Pacific Islands</field><field name="creator">Crowl, Linda S</field><field name="description">This dissertation discusses interactions between politics and book publishing by missions and colonial governments in areas of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia over approximately 200 years. It argues that book publishing has played a fundamental role in shaping politics and that politics has, in turn, shaped book publishing in the Pacific Islands. As a new means of communication in Oceania, book publishing shifted the nature of power by convincing people who did not previously read and write with alphabetic script to value literacy and books, to participate in publishing, and to spread text culture. From its inception, book publishing in the Pacific Islands has been a significant instrument of ideological power: power that can rest on customs, habits, interests, and loyalties; power whose causes and effects might be indistinguishable from each other; power that creates identities and forms societies although the participants themselves might be unaware of that power and how it effects political change. Participants might not distinguish between types of power, and even if they do recognize power and consent to it, they might still resent its existence and effects. Far from portraying a unidirectional flow, wherein only foreigners have published information and instructed Pacific Islanders, this dissertation argues that some islanders have sought to participate in book publishing so as to express their views and/or those of their associates or communities, and this in turn has contributed to persuading and influencing other people, sometimes even across the Pacific. The organization of mission societies around publications, for example in biblical material, schoolbooks, or laws, often reinforced indigenous power, but it also eased the imposition of colonial rule. Ironically, command of text culture assisted islanders to negotiate with new and sometimes stronger political forces. The colonial era has reinforced the role of text culture in the organization of society, and published reiteration of particular languages, customs, and geographical boundaries has helped to shape and reshape polities that have endured well into the age of independent nation-states. Although not all interactions between book publishing and politics were intended or even predictable, books and their publishing in Oceania merit investigation as forms, symbols, rituals, and exchangeable media of ideological power and political change. In reaction to political events, advocates of different viewpoints have, with varying degrees of consciousness, participated in publishing and text culture. In doing so, Pacific Islanders have participated in altering traditional political structures, and they have acted as agents of change in bringing new associations among people, who have melded imported ideas and practices with their own. This dissertation shows that books and their publishing have been catalysts, means, and products of political change in the Pacific Islands.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trace metal behaviour in an industrialised estuarine system and the toxicity of pulsed copper exposures</field><field name="creator">Angel, Brad M</field><field name="description">The concentrations of metal contaminants may fluctuate in estuarine waters due to the erratic nature of sources and various physico-chemical parameters that influence concentrations. Standard toxicity tests use continuous contaminant exposure to assess organism toxicity even though organisms may respond differently when exposed to fluctuating concentrations. An investigation was made of the spatial distribution and short-term temporal fluctuation trace metals in an industrialised estuarine system and the influence of short-term fluctuations in metal concentrations on the toxic effects elicited to aquatic organisms. Copper was determined to be the metal of greatest concern due to the elevation of this metal above concentrations representative of regional waters and because copper is known to be relatively toxic to aquatic organisms. The toxic effects and mechanisms of toxicity in a marine algae and amphipod elicited by pulsed copper exposures were thoroughly investigated in laboratory bioassays.Spatial and temporal sampling and analysis of trace metals in waters and sediments was undertaken in the highly industrialised central Queensland harbour of Port Curtis, Australia, and surrounding waters. The trace metals measured in Port Curtis were significantly higher (p&lt;O.05) than those measured offshore in and adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, indicating the harbour had elevated metals compared to regional concentrations. Dissolved concentration maxima of copper and zinc were measured in the inner harbour of Port Curtis near anthropogenic input sources. Dissolved manganese and nickel exhibited more pronounced concentration maxima than copper and zinc, and were located in the Narrows, a large distance from anthropogenic sources and probably due to natural, but localised, input sources. Temporal monitoring of trace metals near a suspected industrial input to the middle harbour did not detect fluctuating metal concentrations. However, like many industrial harbours, temporal variations in metal concentrations to the waters of Port Curtis are likely, and copper was selected for the pulse-exposure effect studies.Various aspects of pulsed copper exposure (concentration and duration, the duration between pulses, and the frequency and timing of pulses, delayed toxicity, and recovery following pulses) were investigated using new bioassay procedures that were developed in the laboratory specifically for the marine amphipod, Melita plumulosa and the marine alga, Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Mortality and biomass inhibition endpoints wereused for M plumulosa and P. tricornutum, respectively. The pulses were generated by spiking with dissolved copper sulfate into seawater and terminated by replacing the copper-spiked water with clean seawater.The bioassays with M. plumulosa employed dissolved concentrations in the range 301200 ug CulL and exposure durations of 2-240 h. This species exhibited delayed mortality, of which, the majority of effects occurred 48-96-h post-exposure. The results from the current study indicated that short (e.g. 4-d) bioassays may underestimate toxicity, as individuals may be counted as unaffected at the end of tests, but would eventually succumb to effects in the post-exposure period if tests lasted 10-d. The copper pulse concentration and duration were both important parameters that affected the mortality ofM plumulosa. The lack of significant difference in the mean morality of M. plumulosa exposed to multiple pulses separated by different durations in clean water, or to pulses of different frequency but similar time-averaged concentration (TAC), indicated the organism was not able to recover in the period between pulses.The bioassays with P. tricornutum employed dissolved concentrations in the range 4600 ug CulL and exposure durations of 0.3-72 h. Short-term pulses were observed to elicit significant biomass inhibition of P. tricornutum. However, the rate of cellular division of P. tricornutum was similar to that of controls after 24-48-h post-exposure, indicating the alga recovered from exposure after this duration in clean water. The timing of single pulsed exposure in the 72-h bioassay did not generally effect the biomass inhibition ofP. tricornutum. Different exposure scenarios with equivalent TACs of dissolved copper generally elicited similar toxic responses in M. plumulosa and P. tricornutum, indicating that toxicity was related to the TAC of dissolved copper exposure over the duration of the bioassays. This research supports the use of standard toxicity tests that utilise continuous contaminant exposure to predict toxicity in the field, as negative effects elicited by continuous exposure were similar to those elicited by pulsed exposures with similar TACs. The findings suggest single time-point measurements in the field may not adequately assess eco-system contamination, because this only reveals the exposure concentration at the instant the sample was collected, when it is the time-averaged concentration that is related to organism response.A mechanistic study of the effects of copper exposure on P. tricornutum was performed using exposure concentrations in the range 10-50 ug CulL for durations in the range0.3-72 h. The P. tricornutum cells were observed to increase in size and clump together following copper exposure. Cell surface-bound (extra-cellular) copper was measured by extraction with a solution of EDTA, and internalised (intra-cellular) copper was measured by digesting the EDTA-washed algal cells with nitric acid. Copper rapidly bound to the surface of P. tricornutum cells and then surface-copper remained relatively constant. A linear rate of copper internalisation within cells was measured over the exposure duration, indicating copper internalisation was the rate limiting step of metal uptake into P. tricornutum cells. The concentrations of intra- and extra-cellular copper were only observed to increase significantly (p&lt;0.05) above control cells when significant (p&lt;0.05) biomass inhibition was observed. The copper bound to the surface of P. tricornutum cells decreased rapidly when cells were placed in clean seawater. However, the internalised copper per cell did not decrease significantly (p&lt;0.05) until 18-h post-exposure, after which, it exhibited a linear decrease with exposure time. Although the intra-cellular copper concentration per P. tricornutum cell decreased, the total copper measured within all cells in the test population remained relatively constant during the post-exposure period. This indicated that the decrease in intra-cellular copper per cell was due to dilution of copper when divided between daughter cells produced by cellular division, and was not the result of copper efflux from cells.For short-term pulsed copper exposures to P. tricornutum, surface-bound copper increased rapidly, but the short durations did not allow significant internalisation. Between pulses, copper rapidly desorbs from cell surfaces. The short pulsed exposures of 0.3-4 h employed in Chapter 5 were not expected to result in significant copper being internalised within cells, but these exposures still resulted in significant (p&lt;0.05) biomass inhibition. It is hypothesised that the toxicity of short-term copper pulses to P. tricornutum cells is an acute response exerted by copper bound to the surface of cells, rather than a chronic response to internalised copper.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of ostracoda in the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, from the last interglacial to present</field><field name="creator">Reeves, Jessica Marie</field><field name="description">Throughout the majority of the last glacial cycle, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the large body of seawater that extends as a broad tongue into the north of Australia, was an enclosed lake. It would have been possible to walk around the perimeter of the lake from Australia to New Guinea. Aboriginal oral tradition recalls that during some periods, the lake teamed with freshwater fish and waterfowl. At other times, it was shallow and segmented into a series of saline swamps and pools, or even dry and subaerially exposed. Marine waters transgressed the lake margins during periods of high sea level, forming a shallow marine embayment through to open marine conditions. A large brackish lake remained as the waters again receded. The present open shallow marine conditions were emplaced within the last eight thousand years. Fluctuations in the extent and nature of this waterbody through the last glacial cycle are preserved in the sediments of the gulf. The sedimentological interpretation of core material retrieved from the gulf provides a framework of palaeoenvironmental change in the region, in particular the extent of the lake basin, timing of marine influence and evidence of channel activity. Through the detailed analysis of ostracod faunal assemblages of the core sediment and comparison with modern species distribution, inferences are drawn about the ecology of the gulf basin at the time of valve formation. Morphological variation and preservation of the valves also provide information regarding the changing conditions of the waterbody and post-depositional effects. The geochemistry of the ostracod valves permits insight to variations in climate, particularly temperature and effective precipitation change. Comparison and correlation are made with the global sea-level curve and regional climatic records. The implications for the range of environments evident in the gulf region through this period include the presence of warm shallow water for latent heat transport and the generation of cyclones, strengthened monsoon conditions and the mixing of Indian and Pacific Ocean waters through Torres Strait at high sea-level times, and greater continentality, reduced rainfall and altered oceanic currents during sea-level lowstands. The impact of the changing conditions, and shorelines, would have been particularly significant for the human inhabitants who have been present in this region for at least the last fifty thousand years. The nature and extent of the waterbody through the period has enormous implications for people, both as a resource for food and a potential land-bridge between Australia and New Guinea.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that motivate or demotivate young people with sexually abusive behaviours and their families to seek help: a social marketing perspective</field><field name="creator">Bagot, Janice</field><field name="description">Child sexual abuse is a widespread social problem in Australia and across the world. Young people perpetuate a significant proportion of this abuse and many convicted adult paedophiles begin sexually abusive behaviours in their adolescence. One public health strategy to reduce juvenile sexual offending is to increase the numbers of young people receiving assessment and treatment services to address their behaviour. This requires parents to seek help and access services for their child. In order to be able to &#8216;market&#8217; help, this study has aimed to add to the slim body of knowledge about factors that motivate and demotivate young people with sexually abusive behaviours and their families to seek help and utilise treatment services.The theory of planned behaviour and a social marketing framework were used to inform semi-structured interviews conducted with NSW experts in juvenile sexual offending. The study explores expert opinions about the attitudes, social acceptance, perceived ease or difficulty, benefits and costs that young people and their families experience towards seeking help, including the utilisation of treatment services. Results indicate that young people with sexually abusive behaviours towards children are unlikely to seek help before others detect their behaviour. Factors that contribute to a lack of intention to seek help include:(a)	unfavourable attitudes towards seeking help prior to their behaviour being detected (b)	social stigma associated with sexually abusing children and weak social norms around offenders seeking help for their behaviour (c)	lower perceived behavioural control towards seeking help (d)	high perceived costs and low benefits associated with disclosing their behaviour.This study finds that the most common pathway for young people to receive treatment services in NSW is through the voluntary disclosure of the abuse by young victims and the notification of suspected child sexual assault to statutory child protection agencies by mandatory reporters, and a subsequent investigation and referral. Once their behaviour is detected, young people often display more favourable attitudes towards attending treatment services and experience a range of benefits from attending quality treatment provision. This study finds that young people are generally reliant on their parent(s) to be able to access and attend treatment services.A key finding of this study is that many parents are motivated to (and do) take action to address their child&#8217;s sexually abusive behaviour. Concern about their role as parents and family wellbeing are identified as central drivers for parents who try to keep the crisis within the family or reach out to informal or formal sources of help. However, the study reveals a number of demotivating factors towards help-seeking, such as: (a)	psychological distress and defences once parents become aware of their child&#8217;s behaviour (b)	a lack of knowledge about sexual abuse and where to get help (c)	social stigma (d)	unfavourable attitudes at involving external agencies in their family.   Parents can experience a range of benefits if they are able to access and complete effective therapeutic intervention for their child, particularly if this involves the family. Factors that help enable families to utilise treatment services include pressure, support and consequences from statutory authorities and structural factors, such as available, affordable and accessible treatment services.However, a current lack of expertise and skill by service providers and a dearth of affordable and available services, as identified in this study, can leave families frustrated, dissatisfied and reluctant to seek further help. This study highlights the need and opportunity to develop a range of social marketing-based interventions to increase the numbers of parents seeking and receiving help to address their child&#8217;s behaviour. Before help is marketed to families in NSW, however, more high quality, affordable and accessible services are needed to meet both current and future demand. The study recommends that the benefits of treatment services and mandatory reporting be promoted to government policymakers, politicians and funding providers, as well as to statutory child protection agencies working directly with young people and their families.  The study also recommends that social marketing strategies to increase the incidence of parents seeking formal help for their child address: (a)	unfavourable attitudes towards seeking help from formal sources, such as statutory child protection services (b)	low community acceptance and stigma associated with help-seeking for perpetrators of child sexual assault (c)	the perception (and actuality) that it is hard for families to seek help and access treatment services in NSW.This study finds that statutory services play a key role supporting and encouraging parents to seek help for their child. Increasing the favourable attitudes of caseworkers towards treatment and reducing organisational barriers may enable parents to persist with help-seeking. The study also recommends using targeted public campaigns to increase the social acceptability of help-seeking for sexually abusive behaviours. Social marketing-based strategies are also recommended to: (a)	increase the disclosure of sexual abuse by victims (b)	increase identification of abusive behaviours and where to get help for  families of young people &#8216;at risk&#8217; of sexual offending and families in general  (c)	align the product of &#8216;treatment&#8217; with parental desires and motivations.Further research, conducted directly with young people and families, is needed to more accurately gauge their attitudes, perceived benefits and costs and ease or difficulty in seeking help. This customer-focused research would inform any social marketing-based interventions to increase help-seeking behaviour.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complex orthogonal space-time processing in wireless communications</field><field name="creator">Tran, Le Chung</field><field name="description">Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission has recently emerged as one of the most significant technical breakthroughs in modern communication with a chance to resolve the bottleneck of traffic capacity in the future wireless networks. Communication theories show that MIMO systems can provide potentially a very high capacity that, in many cases, grows approximately linearly with the number of antennas. Space-time processing is the main feature of MIMO systems. Space-Time Codes (STCs) are the codes designed for the use in MIMO systems. Among a variety of STCs, orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) possess a much simpler decoding method over other STCs. Because of that, this thesis examines orthogonal STBCs in MIMO systems. Furthermore, Complex Orthogonal STBCs (CO STBCs) are mainly considered in this thesis since they can be used for PSK/QAM modulation schemes, and therefore, are more practical than real STBCs. The thesis starts with the backgrounds on MIMO systems and their capacity, on STBCs, and on some conventional transmission diversity techniques. These backgrounds are essential for the readers to overview the up-to-date scenario of the issues related to this thesis. After reviewing the state of the art of the issues related to this thesis and indicating the gaps in the literature, the thesis proposes three new maximum rate, order-8 CO STBCs. These new CO STBCs are amenable to practical implementations because they allow for a more uniform spread of power among the transmitter antennas, while providing better performance than other conventional codes of order 8 for the same peak power per transmitter antenna. Based on the new proposed CO STBCs, multi-modulation schemes (MMSs) are proposed to increase the information transmission rate of those new codes of order 8. Simulation results show that, for the same MMSs and the same peak power per transmitter antenna, the three new codes provide better error performance than the conventional CO STBCs of the same order 8. In addition, the method to evaluate the optimal inter-symbol power allocation in the proposed codes in single modulation as well as in different MMSs for both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and flat Rayleigh fading channels is proposed. It turns out that, for some modulation schemes, equal power transmission per symbol time slot is not only optimal from the technical point of view, but also optimal in terms of achieving the best symbol error probability. The MMSs, which increase the information transmission rate of CO STBCs, and the method to examine the optimal power allocation for multi-modulated CO STBCs mentioned here can be easily generalized for CO STBCs of other orders. Constructions of square, maximum rate CO STBCs are well known. However, codes constructed via the known methods include numerous zeros, which impede their practical implementation, especially in high data rate systems. This disadvantage is partially overcome by the three new CO STBCs of order 8 mentioned above. Nevertheless, these codes still contain zeros which are undesirable or the design method is neither general nor easy yet. By modifying the Williamson and the Wallis-Whiteman arrays to apply to complex matrices, we discover two construction methods of square, order-4n CO STBCs from square, order-n codes. Applying the proposed methods, we construct square, maximum rate, order-8 CO STBCs with no zeros, such that the transmitted symbols equally disperse through transmitter antennas. These codes have the advantages that the power is equally transmitted via each transmitter antenna during every symbol time slot and that a lower peak power per transmitter antenna is required to achieve the same bit error rates as in the conventional CO STBCs with zeros. The combination of CO STBCs and a closed loop transmission diversity technique using a feedback loop has received a considerable attention in the literature since it allows us to improve performance of wireless communication channels with coherent detection. The thesis proposes an improved diversity Antenna Selection Technique (AST), referred to as the (N + 1;N;K) AST/STBC scheme, to improve further the performance of such channels. Calculations and simulations show that our technique performs well, especially, when it is combined with the Alamouti code [7]. While the combination between STBCs and a closed loop transmission diversity technique in the case of coherent detection has been intensively considered in the literature, it seems to be missing for the case of differential detection. The thesis thus proposes two ASTs for wireless channels utilizing Differential Space-Time Block Codes (DSTBCs), referred to as the AST/DSTBC schemes. These techniques improve significantly the performance of wireless channels using DSTBCs (with differential detection). The proposed AST/DSTBC schemes work very well in independent, flat Rayleigh fading channels as well as in the case of perfect carrier recovery. Does this conclusion still hold in the case of correlated, flat Rayleigh fading channels or in the case of imperfect carrier recovery? To answer this question, first, we propose here a very general, straightforward algorithm for generation of an arbitrary number of Rayleigh envelopes with either equal or unequal power, in wireless channels either with or without Doppler frequency shift effects. The proposed algorithm can be applied to the case of spatial correlation, such as with antenna arrays in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems, or spectral correlation between the random processes like in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. It can also be used for generating correlated Rayleigh fading envelopes in either discrete-time instants or a real-time scenario. The proposed algorithm is not only more generalized and more precise, but also overcome all shortcomings of the conventional methods. Based on the proposed algorithm, the performance of our AST/DSTBC techniques proposed for systems utilizing DSTBCs in spatially correlated, flat Rayleigh fading channels is analyzed. Finally, the thesis examines the effect of imperfect carrier phase/frequency recovery at the receiver on the bit error performance of our AST/DSTBC schemes. The tolerance of differential detection associated with the proposed ASTs to phase/frequency errors is then analyzed. These analyses show that our ASTs not only work well in independent, flat Rayleigh fading channels as well as in the case of perfect carrier recovery, but also are very robust in correlated, flat Rayleigh fading channels as well as in the case of imperfect carrier recovery. The thesis is concluded with useful recommendations on the issues examined here and with a number of future research directions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the use of GIS by public participants in environmental decision-making processes: a case study approach</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Emma</field><field name="description">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have traditionally been used by government agencies engaged in land use planning. As public participation in environmental decision-making has increased in recent times, so has use of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS). This research addresses the current debate regarding PPGIS and its effects on public participants in environmental decision-making processes by comparing the &#8220;top-down&#8221; and &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approaches to providing participants with access to GIS. A set of criteria for evaluating these two approaches were developed and applied to two case studies: (1) Was the GIS information provided easy to use and/or interpret?; (2) Did the GIS assist the participant in their role or help them in any way?; (3) Did the GIS have an impact on decisions being made or opinions of participants?; (4) Were participants comfortable using GIS?; (5) Did the GIS meet the expectations of the participants?; (6) What were the most useful functions of the GIS?; and (7) Will participants be able to use GIS in future? The two case studies were based in the Illawarra region on the south-east coast of Australia. The Kiama Local Environment Plan (LEP) Review was a case study using the &#8220;top-down&#8221; approach, where a Community Panel of sixteen citizens of the Kiama municipality were provided with facilitated access to Kiama Council&#8217;s GIS data to propose a series of recommendations for inclusion in the new LEP. The Landcare Illawarra Community GIS Project was a case study in the &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approach where members of Landcare groups in the Illawarra region were provided with GIS software, data and training to assist them to plan, conduct and evaluate their existing projects. The research found that participants in each case study found the GIS easy to use. Participants in the Landcare case study felt empowered by the GIS because they were able to input their own data, while empowerment of participants in the Kiama LEP Review was dependent on how the Community Panel was facilitated. GIS impacted on the planning decisions made by participants in both case studies. Participants in the Landcare case study who had hands on experience with the GIS, were comfortable with using the technology, gained familiarity with the software during a training course and quickly applied it to their own ends. The most useful functions for Kiama participants were framed in terms of how it assisted them to access the information they required, while Landcare participants noted many of the technical functions such as the ability to input data from a GPS, to calculate areas and to query data as the most useful functions. WebGIS sites were developed for each case study, but the lack of adequate feedback from webGIS users meant that the use of GIS by website participants could not be evaluated as part of this research. Also, while the Landcare case study participants have ongoing access to GIS, it is difficult to determine whether Landcare members will continue to use it given the current lack of technical support.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A case study of an alternative approach to coal mine site water management: West Cliff Colliery NSW</field><field name="creator">Volcich, Antony</field><field name="description">The provision of water supply, its usage and discharge, are major concerns for all mines, both underground and opencut, often accounting for a significant portion of the daily running cost of mining. To reduce these costs, mines will often collect as much site runoff as possible, and recycle the water whenever economically feasible. The constant recycling of on-site waters can mean that, over time, the levels of salinity, acidity or alkalinity, or other contaminants may build up within the internal water management system to a point which may lead to problems with licensed discharge requirements. This project investigated the water quality at West Cliff Colliery, an underground coal mine, in the Illawarra Coal Measures, in order to develop an improved system for managing water resources with minimal environmental impact. While West Cliff Colliery is totally self sufficient and independent of any town water supply, issues have arisen with the quality of water being discharged into the receiving waterways, Brennans Creek and the upper Georges River. To alleviate these issues, a new water management system (WMS) has been established to try and maintain an adequate supply of clean recycled water and to prevent uncontrolled discharges to the environment outside West Cliff's Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) requirements. To monitor changes in the WMS, a new operation of the system involved a daily testing and monthly sampling regime of the key water quality parameters pH, EC, temperature and ORP. These parameters were measured at designated sites within the WMS using probes and meters that had been freshly calibrated each day. Monthly grab samples were also taken from the same designated sites for laboratory analysis of trace (heavy) metals. Chemical speciation modelling was also carried out in order to determine the ecotoxicity of dissolved trace metals in the discharge water. Operating the WMS in the new manner prescribed led to a significant reduction in uncontrolled discharges to the environment, a reduction in salinity of the WMS water, a reduction in the concentrations of potentially ecotoxic elements As, Cu, Ni, and Zn. It also maintained a high level of compliance with the mines current EPL and provided a more constant environmental flow in the upper Georges River without having to resort to much more costly forms of water treatment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cathodic materials for nickel-metal hydride batteries</field><field name="creator">Wang, Caiyun</field><field name="description">The properties of nickel hydroxide, in particular ?-phase nickel hydroxide and spherical nickel hydroxide, were studied. ?-phase nickel hydroxide was prepared by an improved chemical co-precipitation method, while a spray drying technique was employed to obtain spherical shaped particles. The possible use of this new type of solid polymer electrolyte in Ni/MH batteries was also investigated in this work. The element Al was chosen to stabilize the structure of ?-phase nickel hydroxide, that is turbostratic disorder. The content of Al in Al&#65533;substituted nickel hydroxide, Ni(subscript 1-x)Al(subscript x)(OH)(subscript 2)(CO3)(subscript x/2) . nH(subscript 2)O, was x = 0.10, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.33. The as&#65533;prepared nickel hydroxide sample was aged in 6M KOH for 90 days, and the structure was identified by XRD and TEM techniques. Cyclic Voltammetry, the Tafel Curve and discharge behaviors were employed to investigate the electrochemical properties, and the redox potentials, exchange current density, discharge capacity and voltage are discussed. The Al&#65533;substituted nickel hydroxide samples show superior electrochemical performance to ?-nickel hydroxide. A new type of ?-phase nickel hydroxide was also prepared and investigated in this study, (Al,Co)&#65533;substituted nickel hydroxide. Co together with Al was doped to nickel hydroxide, Ni(subscript 1-x)(Al+Co)x(OH)(subscript 2)(CO3)(subscript x/2). NH(subscript 2)O, and the content of (Al+Co) was x = 0.25. It was found that Al and Co had entered the structure of nickel hydroxide. A higher capacity but lower discharge voltage was obtained compared with Al&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) with 25% Al. The temperature effect on three types of nickel hydroxides, Al&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) with 25% Al, (Al,Co)&#65533;Ni(OH)2 ((Al+Co) = 0.25, Co/Al = 0.5) and ?-nickel hydroxide, was investigated. The temperatures investigated were &#65533;15(degress)C, 0(degrees)C, 25(degrees)C and 50(degrees)C. The samples charge/discharge behavior and cycle life were investigated. It was found that Al&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) and (Al,Co)&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) possess the optimum electrochemical performance at 0(degrees)C, while ?-nickel hydroxide shows its best at 25(degrees)C. The samples showed different resistance to the temperature effect, while the highest endurance to low temperature occurred with Al&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) and to high temperature with (Al,Co)&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2). Spherical agglomerates of nanostructured beta-type Ni(OH)(subscript 2) were produced by a spray drying technique. This material features a narrow Gaussian-type particle size distribution in the range of 0.1 &#65533; 10 microns and a high specific surface area of 50 &#65533; 200 m(superscript 2)/g. The spray drying technique was also tried for preparing spherical Al&#65533;substituted nickel hydroxide, and the results show that spherical agglomerates could not be obtained under the same conditions as for ?-type. Certain parameters needed to be changed, the air temperature, the spray speed and the ageing period of the nickel hydroxide slurry, and spherical agglomerate particles of Al&#65533;Ni(OH)(subscript 2) was obtained. A new type of solid polymer electrolytes, tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (TMAH5)&#65533;based with addition of poly(tetramethyl ammonium acrylate) (PTMA) were investigated with a view to its possible use as an electrolyte in Ni/MH batteries. The contents of PTMA in the electrolytes were 0%, 5% and 15%. It was found that the Ni/MH cells employing such solid electrolytes were dischargeable, and the electrochemical performance of TMAH5 + 5% PTMA and TMAH5 + 15% PTMA was improved at 50(degrees)C compared with that at 25(degrees)C.

The combination of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and conducting polymers offers an attractive route for the production of novel compounds that can be used in a variety of application such as sensors, actuators, and molecular scale electronic devices. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop and investigate CNT composites that provide a structural functionality together with one or more other key functions. A variety of novel CNT dispersions were prepared using commercially available CNT systems such as Rice single-walled carbon nanotubes (RCNT), HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes (HCNT), and Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). This study explored the application of novel functional dispersing agents. Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA) a biological molecule, N- sopropylacrylamide 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (NIPPAm-AMPS) a polyelectrolyte, Didodecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) a polymerizable compound, Poly(methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) an inherently conducting polymer, and PVA an insulating polymer were some of the agents used to disperse the CNT. These dispersions were then evaluated in term of their stability and ability to effectively disperse the CNT. Solid-state CNT composites (mats) were then prepared by means of pressure filtration of the CNT/dispersant solutions. These mats were characterized using a variety of different techniques to determine their viability to be used as mechanical actuators or electrochemical devices. The characterization methods included cyclic voltammetry, conductivity, capacitance, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Young&#8217;s modulus, and actuation measurements. Abstract RCNT/conducting polymer composites were prepared by the electropolymerization of Pyrrole with a range of different dopant anions in the presence of different RCNT dispersions. In these composites, the RCNT were completely covered by the polymer, consequently the electrochemical responses of these composites were dominated by the electrochemistry of the polymers with the CNT functioning as a conductor element. Polypyrrole was also electropolymerized using functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNT) as dopant. Electropolymerization was carried out using galvanostatic and potentiostatic techniques on gold-coated Mylar and ITO-glass. It was determined that PPy/FMWCNT composites deposited on either electrode using potentiostatic deposition exhibited redox peaks. This redox behavior was not observed when the galvanostatic deposition was employed. HCNT/Polyaniline (PAn) composites were prepared by either casting a film from a solution of HCNT and PAn in 1,2-Dichlorobenzene, or by casting a film of PAn onto an existing HCNT mat. The latter exhibited the highest conductivity. The actuation behavior of these CNT composites was investigated and it was determined that the PAn component contributes to the actuation strain while the HCNT component contributes to Young&#8217;s modulus. The combination of the HCNT (with their mechanical properties) and PAn (with its actuator behavior) offers and attractive route not only to reinforce the polymer film but also to introduce new electronic properties based on morphological modifications or electronic interactions between the two components giving a robust blend of optimum properties. These results open the door for these composites to be used in a variety of applications that require a combination of the above  characteristics such as mechanically reinforced actuator devices, robotics, optical fiber switches, prosthetic devices, and anti-vibration systems. In addition, PPy with a range of dopant anions was electrodeposited galvanostatically, potentiostatically, and potentiodynamically on the surface of four different carbon electrodes, RCNT mat (unannealed), RCNT mat (annealed), glassy carbon, and carbon foil. It was found that the method of electrodeposition was crucial to the electroactivity of the deposited polymers, particularly when deposited onto a RCNT mat due to the different interaction between the deposited polymer and the RCNT mat.  Finally, HCNT/SDS, HCNT/PMAS, and HCNT/DNA fibers were prepared using the Particle Coagulating Spinning method (PCS). The annealing process resulted in a dramatic increase in conductivity of up to 2600 times higher compared to the unannealed fibers. However, the annealing process did not play any role in keeping the fibers together or modifying the alignment of the carbon nanotubes ropes within the fibers. The HCNT/DNA fibers, with their biocompatibility, high conductivity, and good mechanical properties can be used as artificial muscles, bioelectronic sensors, or even as platforms to support the growth of nerve cells. This thesis delineates the methods of successful production of solid sate CNT mats and fibers, utilizing traditional polymeric and more novel multi- functional dispersant materials. Thereby, providing a series of new framework for which future device structures can be fabricated.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a grounded theory of critical viewing</field><field name="creator">Hadfield, Colin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a report on a study in viewing which details the construction of a grounded theory about &#8216;a pedagogy for critical viewing&#8217;.

This knowledge is important if genuine research partnerships with consumers are to be successfully developed. The research presented here aimed to use accounts by consumers of mental health services to develop an understanding of the experiential and psychological processes of consumers becoming researchers. To achieve this, two qualitative studies were conducted. The first study explored the experiences of being a consumer of mental health services, through a series of focus groups and interviews. Study 2 consisted of an exploration of the experiences for mental health consumers, new to research, in becoming evaluation researchers. The themes resulting from an interpretative phenomenological analysis of consumers' accounts in the two studies provide a rich and wholistic view of the experiences of being a consumer of mental health services, and their experiences of becoming researchers. The results demonstrate that the experience of becoming a researcher was complex, with challenges, benefits, personal change and a range of emotional reactions. The results from Study 1 and Study 2 were then used to develop a model of consumers' experiences becoming researchers. The broader implications of the understanding of consumers' experiences of becoming researchers developed in this research, for developing consumers' roles as researchers and for mental health service provision and clinical practice are discussed. Additionally, the theoretical and methodological implications of the research conducted are examined. Finally, the limitations of the research and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new silicon based detector module for PET</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Peter R</field><field name="description">In the quest to develop high spatial resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET), the goal of this work is to characterise the innovative silicon detector array that forms the foundation of a new PET detector module design. The new detector module circumvents the current requirement for photomultiplier tubes by the implementation of its solidstate detector analogues. The detector module is based upon pixelated scintillation crystals optically coupled to custom designed silicon 8x8 photodiode arrays and read out by a 128 channel low noise charge sensitive preamp. Each element pad of the array has an active area of 3x3 mm2 and, for the work described in this thesis, is coupled via a fan-out connection system to the testing instrumentation. The testing instrumentation included I(V), optical excitation and nuclear spectroscopy (alpha particle and gamma ray spectroscopy). This work fits in as part of a larger project to provide proof of principle of this new PET detector module design. The dark current of individual pixel elements of an unbonded array was found to be 460 pA at an operating bias voltage of 40 V. To investigate uniformity of response across the array, three different methods have been used. Spectroscopy response on the photopeak of 137Cs in the case of optical coupling of each pixel with 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) showed uniformity of collected charge of &#177;28%. Investigation of direct response of pixels across the array with 59.9 keV X-rays from 241Am source demonstrated excellent response. To investigate the variation in uniformity of the detector pixel, the optical response of the array was measured using a laser diode (spot size of ~50 &#956;m) and was found to be &#177;12%. The uniformity of a single pixel element response using scanning optical beam was measured to be &#177;1%. Initial characterisation of 3x3 mm2 diode taken from the same wafer used to create the array was optically coupled to a 4x4x10 mm3 LSO scintillator and then to a 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) scintillator and irradiated by 511 keV and 1.2 MeV gammas from 22Na and 662 keV gammas from 137Cs sources. The energy resolution for the LSO was shown to be 28.8% FWHM for 511 keV and 16.5% for the 662 keV gammas. And the energy resolution for the CsI(Tl) scintillator crystal was 9.5% FWHM for the 511 keV gammas and 7.7% FWHM for the 662 keV gammas. The time properties of this array were tested with coincidence techniques using current pulses from the front and back &#8211; side of the array. For modelling of charge induced in a pixel from LSO photons, in the case of 511 keV photopeak, we used low energy alpha particles generating the same amount of charge. The FWHM of the time spectra was found to be about 700 ps resulting mostly from noise and statistics of charge collection. This specially developed Si pixel array photodiode was demonstrated to satisfy the critical technical parameters required for high resolution PET scanners. Further work has been recommended for stabilisation the sensitive area of pixel to avoid increasing reverse current due to optical coupling. A special optical adhesive has been proposed to avoid this affect.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory evaluation and modelling of shear strength of infilled joints under constant normal stiffness (CNS) conditions</field><field name="creator">Welideniya, H. Senaka</field><field name="description">Infill materials found in natural rock joints may cause a reduction in joint shear strength, influencing rock mass stability. The shear strength of rock mass, already reduced by these discontinuities, will further diminish if they are filled with sediments, thereby posing significant concerns for any construction or excavation carried out in rock. These concerns invite accurate quantification of the shear strength of infilled joints and proper understanding of the basic mechanics of discontinua and the principles involved in their shear deformation. The practical application of any models developed through such studies will be of immense help to mining, tunnelling, and all other underground construction works. The geotechnical research work carried out by the University of Wollongong in the late 90&#8217;s included infilled joint modelling using hyperbolic techniques. A new shear strength model was developed in these studies for predicting unfilled and infilled joint strength based on the Fourier transform method, energy balance principle and the hyperbolic stress-strain simulation.                                         Taking into account the field conditions frequently encountered, the diversity observed in joint shear response and the occasional inadequacy of data (for the estimation of Fourier coefficients and the hyperbolic constants), this study was undertaken to develop a semi-empirical methodology for predicting the shear strength of infilled joints. In this research study joint shear behaviour was studied under CNS and CNL conditions and also the effect of joint orientation and confinement. The study aimed to develop a methodology which includes joint surface characteristics, joint properties, and infill materials. A new model for predicting the shear strength of infilled joints based on a series of tests carried out on two types of model joint surfaces (with asperity angles of 9.50 and 18.50) is presented. Graphite, bentonite and clayey sand were used as infill materials. All tests were carried out in a large-scale shear apparatus under constant normal stiffness (CNS) conditions. The results indicate that at low infill thickness to asperity height ratio (t/a), the combined effect of the basic friction angle (&#981;b) and the joint asperity angle (i) is pronounced, but diminishes with increasing t/a ratio so that the shear strength converges towards the infill alone. This decrease in shear strength with increasing t/a ratio is represented in a normalised manner by dividing the peak shear stress by the corresponding normal stress. Summation of two algebraic functions (A and B) that represent the joint and infill characteristics, correctly model the decay of normalised shear strength with increasing t/a ratio. The new model successfully describes the shear strength of the graphite, clay (bentonite) and clayey sand filled model joints.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of wacnet to ambient intelligent systems</field><field name="creator">Desmet, Antoine</field><field name="description">Control Systems have gone through several stages of development over the past decades. While Fieldbus is now the established global standard for factories and plants, new areas of development are opening, requiring radically different control network architectures. There is currently a strong demand for wireless control networks capable of meeting the application-specific requirements of military, agricultural and biological, building control, land surveying, monitoring and control networks. These new applications have characteristics which are much different from factory applications, including high autonomy and low maintenance, flexibility and adaptation in dynamic environments, extremely small size, rapid and sometimes random deployment, automatic handling of the failed nodes, etc. With the advent of widespread, standardized and reliable wireless standards, a new generation of wireless control networks appears feasible. The concept of Wireless Ad-hoc Control Networks (WACNets) is an ongoing research project which began in 2004, at the University of Wollongong. A WACNet consists of a large number of geographically distributed intelligent and heterogeneous nodes with sensing and/or actuation, local intelligence and control, data processing and wireless communication components. This research project pursues the technological development of the WACNet architecture and hardware, using the state of the art technologies. The other main contribution of this work is the validation of the WACNet platform for real-life applications. A Home Ambient Intelligent system for resource consumption reduction is designed to run on a WACNet architecture. The capacity of a WACNet to support a learning algorithm and the resulting network load is studied. The results of the validation process demonstrate the potential of WACNets to support real-life applications, and also highlight the technical challenges which will have to be tackled before the stage of a commercially-viable product can be reached.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cooling of a hot steel plate by an impinging water jet</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Yongjun</field><field name="description">The rate of heat transfer in a cooling on a high temperature steel strip by an impinging water jet depends on various important factors, which mainly include the velocity of water jet impingement on the cooling surface, the initial temperature of steel strip, the temperature difference between cooling water and cooling surface, and the cooling surface conditions, etc. A good deal of experimental and computational work had been done to study the effects of these factors on the heat transfer rate in this current study. The objective of this study is to clarify the heat transfer characteristics during the cooling process by water jet impingement.Experimental study is mainly focused in this thesis. The selected test conditions are: 1) water jet impingement velocities, which were obtained by adjusting the water flow rate, water nozzle diameter and nozzle-to-surface space; 2) three water nozzles with different size in diameter; nozzle-to-surface spaces; 3) initial steel plate temperatures, which were obtained from heating the steel plate up in a furnace; and 4) flow visualization study by the digitized images of heat transfer, which were captured at 1000 frames per second by a high speed camera.The major findings and achievements of the presented work include the following: 1) measurements of transient temperature distribution on the surface of a hot steel plate during a cooling are successfully achieved by thermocouples. 2) flow visualization analysis is carried out to visually study the heat transfer characteristics by a high-speed camera; 3) programs are written to control the initial plate temperature and water flow rate, acquire the experimental data, and calculate and analyse the heat transfer results; 4) the current research presents the experimental results of the effects of jet velocity, initial temperature on the heat transfer rate.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual codes of secrecy : photography of death and projective identification</field><field name="creator">St George, Julia</field><field name="description">My thesis examines the nexus between secrecy, death, photography and the psychoanalytic dynamic of projective identification, which is an unconscious psychoanalytic interaction which translates and potentially transforms rejected or denied experiences. The visual codes of secrecy, evident through the content and form of photographic images, exist as a nuanced means of social communication. I write about how social secrecy regarding death translates into the visual image. I have isolated social issues of taboos around the representation of the dead in contemporary western culture to explore the dynamics of cultural secrecy. My argument is that photography is the most appropriate form of artistic visual expression because of its links to truthfulness and revelation. It allows a fresh perspective on secrecy through the analysis of images from the difficult genre of postmortem photographs by artists such as Jeffrey Silverthorne, Sue Fox and Andre Serrano. The thesis exposes the concealment/revelation paradox indexical of secrecy. I focus in particular on the photographic treatment of the dead body by artists Sebastio Salgado and Joel Peter Witkin, referencing their work in relation to projective identification. Some of the images of the corpse in my thesis are disturbing and confronting - my argument identifies some of the reasons this is so. This study breaks apart collusive patterns of thinking which adhere around the photographic codes of secrecy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing mental health staff confidence and skills in response to aggression and violence: a longitudinal study of aggression minimisation training</field><field name="creator">Ilkiw-Lavalle, Olga</field><field name="description">Rationale: Aggression minimisation training is essential for mental health staff. No studies to date have investigated the impact of knowledge, prior learning and staff occupations on confidence. Additionally, no studies have followed-up trained staff following actual aggressive and violent incidents to investigate skills used, perceived confidence, fear and satisfaction with the management of incidents. Aim: This research examines: i) the effectiveness of training in aggression minimisation on mental health staff confidence (Study 1) and; ii) the use of learnt skills on staff perceived confidence and fear during actual aggression and violence on inpatient mental health units (Study 2). Method: 103 mental health staff were trained over two days in aggression minimisation. A knowledge evaluation, appraisal of skills questionnaire and the 'Confidence in Coping With Patient Aggression Instrument' were administered pre and post training to measure changes in knowledge, skills and confidence. Participants were subsequently followed up over 18 months. Forty-five trained staff were involved in 95 consecutive incidents of patient initiated aggression and violence. Following actual aggressive and violent incidents participants were interviewed on skills used from training and made ratings of their perceived fear, satisfaction in managing incidents, and completed the 'Confidence in Coping With Patient Aggression Instrument' in relation to the incident. Results: Training led to significant increases in knowledge, skills and confidence. Key training skills subsequently used in actual incidents included verbal de-escalation, physical self-defence and team work. Staff perceived confidence during aggressive and violent incidents was lower in female staff and lower during highly fearful incidents. Male patients and patients displaying physically threatening behaviour evoked higher fear in staff. Staff perceived themselves to be also less confident in managing patients who were physically aggressive. Staff who were more afraid were more likely to use restrictive interventions such as seclusion. Conclusion: Training increases staff confidence and improves skills. Ongoing education is important for all staff to reinforce learning, keep learnt skills current, and for targeting those incidents which are more fear evoking and for which staff lack confidence in managing.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From paradise lost to promised land: christianity and the rise of West Papuan nationalism</field><field name="creator">Rizzo, Susanna Grazia</field><field name="description">In 1953 Aarne Koskinens book, The Missionary Influence as a Political Factor in the Pacific Islands, appeared on the shelves of the academic world, adding further fuel to the longstanding debate in anthropological and historical studies regarding the role and effects of missionary activity in colonial settings. Koskinens finding supported the general view amongst anthropologists and historians that missionary activity had a negative impact on non-Western populations, wiping away their cultural templates and disrupting their socio-economic and political systems. This attitude towards mission activity assumes that the contemporary non-Western world is the product of the West, and that what the Rest believes and how it lives, its social, economic and political systems, as well as its values and beliefs, have derived from or have been implanted by the West. This postulate has led to the denial of the agency of non-Western or colonial people, deeming them as history-less and nation-less: as an entity devoid of identity. But is this postulate true? Have the non-Western populations really been passive recipients of Western commodities, ideas and values? This dissertation examines the role that Christianity, the ideology of the West, the religion whose values underlies the semantics and structures of modernisation, has played in the genesis and rise of West Papuan nationalism. The modernist and primordialist approaches to the study of the relation between nationalism and religion assume either structural-functionalist or intellectualist definitions of religion. This thesis rejects that view in postulating that religion plays a foundational role in the rise of both historical consciousness and nationalism. Positioning itself in antithesis to traditional primitivist approaches to the study of West Papua, which have tended to study the Papuan people as a set of distinct tribes, each endowed with particular identity dynamics, this thesis attempts to provide a comprehensive study of West Papuan nationalism as a single ethnic and geographical entity. Breaking away from modular forms of nationalism, which consider such a phenomenon as a res capable of being transplanted, it attempts to recover the eventful reconfigurations which have allowed for the rise of West Papuan national consciousness and identity. Sahlins structure of the conjuncture will be used as the basis for the articulation of a methodology to enable the recovery of the lost history of pre-literate peoples and the discarding of the interrelated myths of history-less-ness and nation-less-ness. This thesis argues that West Papua was a distinct ethnic identity long before the Europeans entered the region. This identity was shaped and defined by processes of adaptation to a particular ecosystem and by the longstanding relations that the Papuans had engaged in with the neighbouring Malay populations in, what can be regarded as, the Maluku-Papuan-Ceramese zone. Consequently Papuan pre-colonial ethnic identity, authenticated by a series of myths and stories, acted as the prime mover in determining the relational dynamics and dialectics with the Europeans and Christianity. It will be shown that Christianity did not create the Papuan nation and West Papuan nationalism, although, once Christianity was inculturated into the Papuan cultural-religious template, Christian institutions acted as the structure and semantics by which the Papuans were able to communicate and articulate communal sentiments of belonging, coalescing into a unified entity. Papuan hermeneutics, known as cargoism, played an important role in mediating and systemising Christian beliefs and values into Papuan cultural-religious templates, so that the locus of Papuan national identity came to reside in the intersection of Papuan stories and myths with Christian narratives. In the aftermath of World War II, the Dutch nation-building program inculcated into the emerging Papuan intelligentsia an idea of nation and nationalism, which could serve their neo-colonial interests and resist Indonesian incorporation of the territory. This program came to clash with the autochthonous Papuan nationalism, which had manifested itself in the great Koreri movement of 1938-1942.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritive and non-nutritive blood flow in skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Hoy, Andrew James</field><field name="description">The vascular structure of mammalian skeletal muscle has been intensively investigated for the last seventy years. Since the early work of Pappenheimer and Barlow, the existence of a parallel dual vascular pathway has been suggested to explain the differences between total flow and clearance rates of a variety of infused substances. Direct microscopy studies using superficial muscles have shown that the microvascular arterioles have very frequent connections with the capillary modules of the associated connective tissue and adipose tissue within skeletal muscle. In more recent times, Clark and colleagues have identified two vascular pathways according to the opposing actions of two groups of vasoconstricting agents. While all increase perfusion pressure, Type A vasoconstrictors (low dose noradrenaline (Nad), vasopressin, angiotensin II) increase oxygen uptake but Type B vasoconstrictors (serotonin, high dose noradrenaline) decrease hindlimb oxygen consumption. The opposing effects on oxygen consumption are thought to arise from selective vasoconstriction of the mircrovasculature. Type A vasoconstrictors redirect blood into muscle tissue capillary beds (termed nutritive bed) whilst Type B vasoconstrictors redirect blood into the associated connective tissue, adipose and septum capillary beds (termed non-nutritive bed). Many of the previous studies are based on variations of an in situ rat, isolated perfused hindlimb model, having low vascular tone and often with insufficient oxygen carrying capacity to support active metabolism. In vivo, skeletal intramuscular blood redistribution during exercise occurs principally via the release of vasodilatory metabolites and the nervous system. This thesis used a novel in vivo model to test the hypothesis that nutritive and non nutritive blood flow distribution can still be observed under conditions of high vascular tone and oxygen delivery at rest and in metabolically active (contracting) muscle. Utilising the high vascular tone, it also tests the hypothesis that the vascular pathways can be differentiated using vasodilators. Male Wistar rats were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital (6mg.100g(superscript &#65533;1) i.p.). The right femoral artery was cannulated to supply blood to the left femoral artery (perfused) at a constant flow (basal 1ml.min(superscript &#65533;1), contraction 2ml.min(superscript &#65533;1) via a pump. Perfused hindlimb pressure was recorded distal to the pump and passive venous return occurred from the left femoral vein to the right external jugular vein. Systemic blood pressure was recorded from the left common carotid artery. Polyethylene cannulae were filled with heparinized 0.9% saline containing 6% w/v dextran70. The left sciatic nerve was isolated and stimulated (5Hz) to produce twitch contraction in the lower hindlimb muscle bundle and developed tension was recorded. Vasoactive drugs (2 constrictor, 8 dilator) were prepared with saline and 0.01% ascorbic acid, and injected into the arterial loop. Blood was sampled from the venous and arterial loops and oxygen consumption determined using the Fick equation. In the autoperfused rat hindlimb, the Type B vasoconstrictor increased perfusion pressure and caused a significant decrease in basal hindlimb oxygen consumption, however during muscle contraction this effect on oxygen consumption was diminished. The Type A vasoconstrictor had no significant effect on hindlimb oxygen consumption during significant increases in perfusion pressure. Eight vasodilators with a variety of mechanisms of action were screened at rest but none were observed to decreases hindlimb oxygen consumption in a fashion similar to Type B vasoconstrictors. Increases in oxygen availability at rest via increased nutritive flow by noradrenaline and vasodilator infusion had no effect upon basal metabolic rate. Therefore, during adequate oxygen delivery, increased availability has no effect upon metabolic demand. Isoprenaline and histamine significantly increased hindlimb oxygen consumption during the contraction protocol, whilst there was no significant effect observed at rest. It can be concluded that selective vasoconstriction metabolites can overcome exogenous vasoconstriction. These results confirm the possible existence of a dual vascular pathway however blood flow redistribution via vasodilation is likely determined by the locale of vasodilator release rather than differences in receptor distribution.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbolism, rationality and myth in organizational control systems: an ethnographic case study of PBS Jakarta Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Wahyudi, Imam</field><field name="description">The study of accounting in its environmental contexts requires an understanding of accounting beyond its technical and numerical aspects. To obtain social, cultural and political legitimacy, organizations tend to adopt formal structures and practices &#65533; including accounting &#65533; that have been widely accepted by society as social norms and values without necessarily using them in actual practices. Seen from this perspective, accounting information, and particularly budgeting that plays an important role in organizational control systems, is not value free. It intermingles and is implicated in constructing social reality by shaping and being shaped by the political interplay among contested interested parties that takes place in organizations. This study examines the impact of the institutionalization of the authoritarian-bureaucratic regime of the New Order government of Indonesia in the PBS Jakarta &#65533; a private higher education institution &#65533; on the role of accounting and budgeting used within the organization. Incorporating the theory of closure of Weber and power mobilization developed by Hardy (1996) into institutional theory, a theoretical research framework is developed to reflect the researcher&#65533;s understanding regarding the research process as a result of his experience in interacting with the subject being studied for more than a decade &#65533; as an academic as well as an administrative staff member. Following an ethnographic case study method that allows the involvement of the researcher as a part of the case being studied, the subjective experience of the researcher enriches the analysis of this study &#65533; reflexive-ethnography. An historical analysis is performed by involving a confirmation by the researcher of other organizational participants&#65533; understanding about the school&#65533;s control system through interviews &#65533; inter-subjective analysis. Documents and archival records are also used in order to provide official organizational and descriptive historical contexts of the case and to make available the powerful link between what people say-interviews-and what they actually do. Instead of formal organizational structures being adopted, this study found that informal relationships, paternalistic management and physical control dominated everyday managerial practices in which the school head held the absolute power in the school. Budgeting as part of formal control systems, in this environment, facilitated a political deal among the school&#65533;s stakeholders and functioned as a rationalized myth to the process-not an efficiency measurement. In addition, financial statements played a symbolic reason to display how the managerial conduct was rational and financially responsible. An effort to implement a technical-rational efficiency discourse of budgeting into the school by the new school head, after the demise of the New Order government, turned out to be a devastating blow to the school development as it contradicted the organizational culture that existed in the school. Therefore, these findings contribute to the understanding of accounting as providing socially constructed meanings and reality-accounting is value-laden.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skeletal muscle fatigue: can omega-3 fatty acids optimise skeletal muscle function?</field><field name="creator">Peoples, Gregory Edward</field><field name="description">It has been well established that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (found in fish oil) have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system including a reduction in ischaemia induced cardiac arrhythmia and increased threshold required to induce electrically ventricular fibrillation. In heart, membrane phospholipid composition reflects dietary fat content. In particular regular fish consumption in humans has been shown to reduce the incidence of new heart attacks, while in rats n-3 PUFA is associated with improved oxygen efficiency and maintained function. In skeletal muscle, membrane composition also reflects dietary fat content. Increased dietary n-3 PUFA has significant effects on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and substrate preference amongst a number of other functional changes. The direct effects of n-3 PUFA on skeletal muscle oxygen consumption has not been investigated and may have a significant role in maintaining contractile performance and reducing fatigue. The aim of this thesis was to study the possible direct effects of dietary n-3 PUFA on skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and function in rats. Male Wistar rats (12 weeks old) were fed, ad lib, one of three diets (SF: saturated fat; n-6 PUFA: safflower oil; n-3 PUFA: tuna fish oil) for a period of 8 weeks. The total fat content of the diets was 10% by weight and the level of polyunsaturation in the n-6 and n-3 groups was controlled using a mixture of the test oil and monounsaturated olive oil. After 8 weeks, skeletal muscle oxygen consumption, function and fatigue were assessed using the rat auto-perfused contracting hindlimb developed in this thesis and membrane fatty acids were analysed. The hindlimb auto-perfusion enabled control of blood flow to the animals hindlimb in resting and contracting conditions with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and skeletal muscle twitch tension. The auto-perfusion achieved close to physiologically relevant oxygen consumption and perfusion pressure with a hindlimb flow rate that was reflective of in vivo conditions compared to previously used rat hindlimb perfusion systems. The skeletal muscle membrane composition was reflective of the fat content in the diets. Animals fed n-3 PUFA compared to SF and n-6 PUFA significantly increased total n-3 PUFA, mostly through increased levels of the long chain fat docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the membranes. This significantly altered the n-3/n-6 ratio in the membranes. The change in membrane fatty acid composition was very close to previously established changes in the heart after similar dietary interventions, particularly DHA content. The collective results of this thesis support the role of the long chain n-3 PUFA DHA in membranes, as a requirement for optimal skeletal muscle function. In the rat auto-perfused contracting hindlimb, during brief (10minutes) and prolonged (30minutes) bouts of stimulation, in recovery after bouts of stimulation and during hypoxic conditions, n-3 PUFA feeding was associated with enhanced muscle contractile function and indicative of reduced fatigue. Specifically, reduced fatigue in the n-3 PUFA group during normoxic conditions was associated with maintenance of isometric twitch rise time, fall time, contraction duration and maximum rate of tension development and relaxation. The effect of diet on these twitch characteristics provide information that may explain the measured differences in fatigue, such as sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. Supportive of the possible changes in skeletal muscle calcium handling was the greater recovery of tension from the fatigued state in n-3 PUFA animals when caffeine was administered. Of particular interest in regard to the hypothesis of this thesis, reduced fatigue in the n-3 PUFA group was associated with modulated oxygen consumption during contraction and recovery. These results complement earlier findings in heart and establish n-3 PUFA DHA in skeletal muscle as an essential membrane fatty acid for optimal function. If human applications of these results are successful, it is most likely that dietary n-3 PUFA may have significant impact on dysfunctional skeletal muscle and improve quality of life. This encompasses muscle function in combination with sedentary life style, diabetes, heart failure, or muscular dystrophy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmarking of native XML database systems</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yu</field><field name="description">In this thesis, XML database systems, standard database benchmark techniques, and XML database system benchmarks such as XBench, XMark, XMach-1, and X007 are reviewed.

In seven studies, undergraduate students were instructed either to complete a recognition memory test to the best of their abilities, or to simulate accident&#65533;related memory loss. These studies extended previous research by investigating electrophysiological differences between the control and malingering tasks (1) for stimuli which differed in linguistic frequency, (2) in tests which varied the format of word presentation, (3) during the initial encoding of the stimuli, and (4) using ERP components not previously considered in studies investigating the detection of malingering. The main results were that simulating individuals appear to use more active or additional cognitive processing during task performance compared to those who respond honestly, with this enhanced effort reflected in an ERP effect indexing earlier recognition of previously-studied words. This earlier recognition, considered to be the result of more elaborative or efficient encoding of the stimuli, was most evident in the easier forms of the recognition test and in malingerers who presented a more believable profile of impairment. The malingerers also demonstrated different electrophysiological responses to items that were incorrectly classified, and a pattern of response latency suggesting that they concealed recognition of previously-studied items. Overall, the results indicate that the simulation of amnesia on a recognition memory task involves qualitatively different processing of the word stimuli, which may be detected in the waveforms and more covert patterns of behaviour of these individuals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent automated drilling and reaming of carbon composites</field><field name="creator">Fernandes, Marta</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research in intelligent automated drilling of carbon fibre composites. This work has been motivated by the aircraft industry where there is a significant interest in automating part of the production process to improve productivity and consistency. The requirements for automated drilling as well as problems inherent in drilling composites are addressed.Drilling Forces and moments are  nvestigated and used to model the  drilling process. A mathematical model is developed to represent the thrust forces and this model also accounts for aging of the tool. The quality of the holes produced was investigated and parameters such as surface finish, break outs and size of the holes were related to the drilling parameters and forces generated.A decision making algorithm has been designed to enable parameters to be varied during the drilling operation to maintain optimum conditions. This decision making algorithm takes into account inherent system limits and uses information such as age of the tool and maximum force allowed to provide the spindle speed and feed rate to be used at each stage of the drilling process. The aim of this algorithm is to choose the parameters which will minimize drilling time and tool wear while maintaining quality of the holes and respecting the initial conditions of maximum thrust force.The developed system has been mplemented and shown to successfully drill holes of acceptable quality despite inherent aging of drill bits while maximising productivity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of wages and nonwage amenities on the labour market for high school teachers in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the teacher labour market in NSW and examines the effects of the current wage fixation system and labour market conditions on the quantity and quality of teachers in NSW high schools. Allowing for the budget constraints facing the NSW Government and other employer groups, this thesis explores alternative ways to increase teacher utility and thus incentives to work as teachers through improvements in nonwage amenities. This thesis uses hedonic wage theory to examine how workers will try to maximise their utility based on their individual preferences for wage and nonwage amenities and applies this framework to the high school teacher labour market in NSW. The thesis suggests ways of improving the level of teacher satisfaction (utility) in NSW high schools with the aim of improving teacher retention rates and attracting more high quality university graduates to the teaching profession. These policy recommendations are designed to alleviate the shortages of teachers that already exist in some disciplines and locations. In addition, the shortage of teachers is likely to grow unless remedial actions are taken. The promotion of greater job satisfaction among teachers may not only help to alleviate this shortage but can also lead to increased teacher effectiveness, which ultimately affects student achievement.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information technology adoption by companies in Thailand: a study of enterprise resource planning system usage</field><field name="creator">Arunthari, Santipat</field><field name="description">Throughout the world, contemporary business organisations rely heavily for their operations on various software packages. The choice of particular operational systems and software can have a significant influence on a company's competitive advantage. Managerial decisions regarding all aspects of IT (computer hardware, software and human resources) are central to the success of a company, and cannot be made without a good understanding of available software options. By the same token, the success of the software companies designing software solutions for such companies depends on a rich understanding of the very specific needs of contemporary businesses. The more shared understanding between the needs of a specific type of company and the possibilities of software development, the better the outcome for both sides. This study has identified a problematic lack of knowledge regarding how companies identify their system needs and choose appropriate software vendors and products for one of their most significant areas of operation. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a rich picture of the basis upon which Thai-owned and multinational companies in Thailand make major decisions regarding the software underpinning their various business operations, and what they need to know in order to make the most effective decisions. The study aimed to identify issues, factors and problems as critically involved in IT adoption, and reveal any significant factors in the needs of Thai-owned and multinational companies in Thailand. Specifically, the study began by examining typical application software used to serve major business functions. These include accounting, human resources (HR), customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM); internal IT usage such as the Internet and e-mail; IT platforms, resources and policies or strategies; as well as the specific enterprise system known as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. From an initial quantitative study it emerged that ERP systems are currently the most significant IT application of concern for both Thai-owned and multinational companies. As this seems an area of major growth opportunity, a further study was conducted, using qualitative methods, to ascertain exactly how the various companies made their decisions on ERP system adoption. Grounded theory was chosen as a method of qualitative data collection and analysis. The study contributes to the literature on ERP system adoption, which is currently under-researched particularly in developing countries such as Thailand. Even in developed countries where most research into ERP systems has taken place, published research mainly focuses on issues related to the implementation phase of the ERP lifecycle. The study provides insights into adopters' attitudes, decisions, implementation and usage of an ERP system. It is believed that attitude and behavioural intention towards ERP system adoption are correlated. The study contributes to attitude-behaviour relationship theory, refining in particular the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Furthermore, not only does this research contribute to the academic literature on this topic but it should be of value to practitioners in large organisations, government agencies and IT vendors at large, but also particularly to those who have business in Thailand or other Asian or developing countries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business ethics: fact or fiction - a look at the applicability, acceptability and adaptability of ethical values in the business sector</field><field name="creator">Puttee, Colleen</field><field name="description">Is it relevant to associate business with ethics or are the two so polemic that their coalition becomes farcical? Ethics has long been considered as an expression for all things good whilst business represents a forum for the exchange of goods and services with a view to making profits. Note that whilst both incorporate the same word 'good' as part of their persona the meaning of the word carries quite different connotations. This pluralistic nature of the term highlights a pivotal point in this thesis. The meaning of a word and or expression is governed by its linkages and or associations with other words and hence acknowledging the relevance of a particular word cannot occur without first evaluating its hermeneutical origins and then contextualizing it within the desired domain. This thesis is divided into three sectors with the first addressing the issue of the meaning of ethics from a western cultural perspective. Whilst any cultural position would be valid this perspective was chosen due to the strong influence western cultures have on business dealings. Ethics is researched philosophically from the initial orations of Socrates through to the Postmodern discourse of Rorty and that of Kohlberg and Habermas. Each stage of its historical development adds definition to its meaning in current day language. The second section of the thesis addresses the multiplicity of meanings of words and the general use of language as a tool of communication. The written word plays a dominant part in the daily management of an organisation's operations and as such the concept of clarity of expression becomes a crucial element in the development of company policies or manuals to ensure a successful transition to actions. The language of the written word plays multiple roles in its deliverance of meaning and direction. For example it has to be sufficiently descriptive so as to guide intended meaning yet at the same time it has to restrict interpretation to reduce the opportunity for misunderstanding and or inappropriate actions. The cues adopted must be suitably strong enough to compensate for the lack of visual interaction between the writer and the recipients. The language of ethics is even more complex in that it has no absolute definition but rather a set of principles that draw meaning from the time and context within which they are being adopted. Hence it can be considered relevant to business if appropriately situated and defined. The final section of the thesis identifies the multi-layers of business practices and the plethora of cultures that impact upon their operations and how these factors skew the interpretation of ethics in business. Whilst most businesses acknowledge the need for ethics to form a part of their operations they fail to take the time to fully implant its intent. A survey of a number of top Australian companies identified that companies tend to adopt an applied version of ethics which serves more as a protection against social censure, or worse litigation, rather than addressing the basic tenets of ethics. There is no identification of its principles or even an attempt to define the term in context with the company profile. The same is also found when evaluating the professional occupations which profess to practice such virtues in exchange for autonomy and social service. In summation, the oxymoron that is often touted against the expression business ethics only holds because business has yet to define ethics in context with their practices. An exemplar of a code of ethics is offered as a basis for businesses to develop their own model, one that embraces personal, social national and international sentiments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields on protein unfolding</field><field name="creator">Berry, Yoke</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a spectroscopic investigation of the effects of pulsed electromagnetic radiation on the conformation, unfolding, aggregation and precipitation of a variety of proteins. Initial experiments required the calibration of a microwave exposure system thus the temperature of different buffer solutions was studied in detail. The exposure system comprised of an incubator and a rebuilt domestic microwave oven that delivered pulses every six minutes to give a plot of the temperature before, during and after a pulse period of microwaves. All solutions returned to their baseline temperature prior to the next pulse period. The effect of exposure to microwave pulses of several seconds duration on the aggregation rate of six stressed target proteins (alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, catalase, citrate synthase, insulin and ovotransferrin) was examined in solution. The hypothesis tested was that the initial rate of precipitation of samples exposed to microwave pulses once every six minutes was significantly higher than that of a control held at the same average temperature. The results show statistical significance to confirm the hypothesis in all cases except for insulin, bovine serum albumin and citrate synthase when the latter two proteins were maintained at an average temperature of 45oC and 37oC respectively. In these exceptional cases, the microwave induced temperature excursion was not expected to induce a change in the precipitation rate on the basis of previous knowledge of the unfolding behaviour of the proteins. The second hypothesis tested was that the molecular chaperone, &#945;-crystallin prevents the aggregation and precipitation of target proteins under the above regimes. It was found that &#945;-crystallin suppressed precipitation but it was not as effective when proteins were also exposed to pulsed microwaves. The effect of exposure to 50 Hz DC and AC electric field was examined on stressed alcohol dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. The hypothesis tested was that the initial rate of precipitation of samples exposed to microwave pulses once every six minutes was significantly higher than that of a control held at the same average temperature. This was not detected. When a difference could be detected, it was only observed in a increase or decrease in precipitation, well after exposure.The results of this thesis are relevant to the setting of standards for microwave exposure as they show that a six-minute averaging period of temperature is not appropriate in the prediction of protein unfolding.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3-hydroxykynurenine in the human lens</field><field name="creator">Korlimbinis, Anastasia</field><field name="description">The human lens contains three kynurenine UV filters, 3- hydroxykynurenine O-&#946;-Dglucoside (3OHKynG), kynurenine (Kyn) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OHKyn), and it absorbs UV light in the 300-400 nm region due to their presence. UV filters may also prevent UV-induced photodamage to the retina and lens. After middle age, the UV filters, 3OHKynG and Kyn become bound progressively to proteins in the centre of our lenses. This feature is, in part, responsible for normal age-dependant human lens colouration.To provide proof that 3OHKyn is bound to normal human lenses, model studies were undertaken. Cysteine (Cys), histidine (His) and lysine (Lys) residues in lens proteins had been previously shown to bind to UV filters in vivo, therefore adducts of these amino acids and 3OHKyn were synthesised and characterised by mass spectrometry, fluorescence, UV-visible and NMR spectroscopy in Chapter 2. The stability properties of each of the 3OHKyn amino acid adducts were also determined, with incubations performed at pH 4.0 and pH 7.2. 3OHKyn-t-Boc-His was identified as the most stable of the three adducts. 3OHKyn-t-Boc-Lys and 3OHKyn-Cys both decomposed at pH 7.2 forming numerous oxidation products. The stability of each adduct to acid hydrolysis was also examined.In Chapter 3, calf lens protein was incubated with 3OHKyn, and acid hydrolysis showed that Cys was the primary site of modification when the incubation was undertaken at pH 7.2. However, when the incubation was undertaken at a higher pH (for example, pH 9.5), 3OHKyn readily modified Cys, His and Lys residues. Previously acid hydrolysis of human lens protein had identified Kyn attachment to the proteins. However, acid hydrolysis was not an appropriate method for detecting 3OHKyn attached to human lens proteins because 3OHKynG is also bound to human lens proteins. Therefore, a new assay was developed, and it was found that 3OHKyn does indeed bind to human lens proteins in an age-dependant manner. The assay also provides data for 3OHKynG and Kyn attachment to human lens proteins. In Chapter 3, &#945;-crystallin was also incubated with 3OHKyn under low oxygen tension, and the findings from this study showed that 3OHKyn modified the Cys residue in &#945;Acrystallin. In addition, oxidation of methionine and tryptophan was observed. Agerelated nuclear cataract is associated with colouration, insolubilisation and extensive oxidation of Cys and methionine residues. It appears that 3OHKyn in the lens may promote the oxidation and modifications of proteins, and may contribute to oxidative stress in the human lens.In Chapter 4, the aim was to examine if 3OHKyn could act as a crosslinker of cataract lens proteins. 3OHKyn is known to readily oxidise and yield highly reactive species. It was therefore proposed that 3OHKyn bound to lens proteins could promote crosslinking, insolubilisation and colouration of lens proteins following formation of oxidised species. 3OHKyn amino acid adducts were incubated with excess amino acids, and the resulting products examined. These compounds may be analogous to those that would form in a cataract lens. In addition, 3OHKyn-modified protein was incubated and the products were examined by SDS-PAGE, fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Results showed that 3OHKyn, under the conditions used, does not crosslink lens protein. Proof of the hypothesis that 3OHKyn crosslinks proteins in the lens requires the isolation of characteristic chemical markers from cataract lens proteins that contain the modified 3OHKyn molecules.In Chapter 5, the aim was to isolate novel compounds from the hydrolysates of human cataract lens proteins and to determine their chemical properties.Overall this thesis provides evidence that 3OHKyn plays a role in the post-translational modification of normal human lens proteins, and it also provides preliminary data on the role of 3OHKyn in human cataract.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and characterisation of polyaniline - carbon nanotube conducting composite fibres</field><field name="creator">Mottaghitalab, Vahid</field><field name="description">The present study describes methods for development and characterization of conducting electroactive polymer (CEP) fibre consisting of polyaniline (PAni) and single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) which have potential applications as electronic devices to form building blocks of electronic textiles. The conducting composite fibres of PAni- SWNT were developed respectively using two steps (acid doping after fibre spinning) and one step methods (doping during preparation of spinning solution). The effectiveness of nanotube inclusion for improvement of mechanical, electrical and electrochemical properties was studied in each method. During development of the fibres, techniques such as UV-Vis-NIR, Raman spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering and viscometery were used to characterise the quality of dispersion and spinning solutions. It has been shown that the N,N'-dimethyl propylene urea (DMPU) and dichloro acetic acid (DCAA) as solvents respectively for PAni in base and salt form are able to effectively disperse the pristine SWNTs to reach percolation level. The addition of nanotubes changes the rheological behavior of neat PAni spinning solution from a Newtonian to non-Newtonian shear thinning fluid based on power law regime which reflects nanotube-nanotube and/or nanotube-polymer physical entanglement. Several techniques including DMA, DSC, SEM, TEM, FIB, Raman spectroscopy, CV and four point probe electrical conductivity measurement were employed to characterize the various properties of the solid fibre. In both, one step or two steps methods, fibres containing SWNTs have superior tensile strength and elastic modulus compared with neat PAni fibre. The inclusion of SWNTs to PAni, however, decreases the elongation at break. These outcomes directly can be attributed to physical and/or chemical interfacial interaction between well distributed SWNTs bundles and the PAni matrix. The addition of nanotubes to the PAni matrix also increases the electrical conductivity and enhances the electrochemical redox process. However, the two step method was found to have some problem include low spinning rate, low flexibility and low conductivity and insufficient charge transfer along the fibre to be working electrode. These disadvantages were diminished by faster spinning of PAni- ES/2-acrylamido-2 methyl -1-propane sulfonic acid (AMPSA)/SWNT using the one step process with more than 5 times stretching ratio. An electronic conductivity percolation threshold of ~ 0.35 % w/w SWNTs was determined with fibres possessing electronic conductivity up to ~ 750 Scm-1. The well defined electrochemical window for neat PAni- ES/AMPSA fibre and its composite containing SWNT either in aqueous or ionic liquid electrolyte, with wider electrochemical window, confirms the ease of charge transport through a new conduction path for the fibre formed from salt structure, which was enhanced by addition of nanotubes. The ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break of PAni-ES/AMPSA/SWNT fibres containing 0.76 % w/w nanotubes respectively were obtained 255 &#177; 32 Mpa, 7.3 &#177; 0.4 GPa and 4 &#177; 1 % compared with 170 &#177; 22 MPa, 3.4 &#177; 0.4 GPa and 9 &#177; 3 % for PAni-ES/AMPSA fibre. The quantitative analysis of nanotube orientation and detection of load transfer from matrix to nanotubes were investigated in PAni- S/AMPSA/SWNT composite fibre using Raman spectroscopy. It has been found that thermal stretching of as spun fibre mostly orients the nanotubes in a range of about &#177; 30&#176; versus fibre axis which extremely increase the Herman orientation factor from 0.02 for as spun fibre to 0.43 for the 5x drawn fibre. Moderate orientation and Raman shift about 90- 130 cm-1 in D* band of SWNT be correlated to effective but not prefect load transfer between PAni matrix and nanotubes. The result of temperature dependent electrical conductivity data was shown that the higher conductivity of PAni-ES/AMPSA/SWNT composite fibre compared to neat PAni-ES/AMPSA fibre also can be described by improvement of the metallic property in the crystalline areas and boosting of the metallic disorder contribution in amorphous area. The consequence of improvement of mechanical, electrical and electrochemical properties were a benefit for applying of PAni/ES-AMPSA fibre and its composite having SWNT in applications as actuator, power source and sensor. While the fibres showed great promise as actuators, their response as batteries and temperature/ humidity sensors was limited. The significant improvement was observed in actuator strength in excess of 100 MPa and work-per-cycle of over 300 kJ/m3 through the incorporation of small amounts of SWNTs as reinforcement in the PAni matrix. This performance is 3 times higher than previously produced conducting polymer actuators and exceeds skeletal muscle in terms of stress generation by 300 times. PAni- ES/AMPSA/SWNT exhibited a higher charge/discharge capacity (12.4/11.2 mAhg-1) compared with the neat PAni-ES/AMPSA (4.5/4.1 mAhg-1). All the results show that solid polyaniline fibre can be used directly as electrode in ionic liquid of EMI.TFSI for wearable power source system. However its current performance is still well below conventional rechargeable battery systems. PAni fibre and its SWNT composite showed a nonlinear response with some delay to temperature signals. The PAni fibre incorporated with SWNTs showed lower sensitivity to change in humidity pulse compared with neat PAni fibre. This behavior has good opportunity for application in conducting yarn that needs the lowest variability in conductivity for transferring of electrical signal but clearly is not favored for sensing of humidity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intensity-modulated radiation therapy dose maps: the matchline effect</field><field name="creator">Tangboonduangjit, Puangpen</field><field name="description">In 2002 when this research started the brief of the project was to produce streamlined checks of planar dose maps delivered by IMRT fields to film. At this time no other centre in Australia had a protocol for checking accuracy of RTP planned RT dose distributions. While many US centers have been checking IMRT distributions, there is still no standard protocol for these checks. By the end of this project in 2005, 13 IMRT patient treatments had been successfully checked and this centre remains the only centre to have treated IMRT patients in Australia using the pinnacle RTP planning computer platform. Early film dose maps revealed dose spikes due to MLC matchline effects. These matchlines were due to Varian MLC leaf ends sometimes matching other segment neighbors and were not predicted using pinnacle RTP until version 7.4 available about 2 months prior to the end of this project cycle. Verifying a radiation treatment planning (RTP) computer's IMRT calculation was the first task for this thesis. Planar dose maps (dose in water perpendicular to the beam [cGy/MU]) were compared with beam dose distributions measured using films (XV and EDR) at various depths. The RTP computer and film measurements agreed within &#61617;3% within the inside field region. In addition, the XV film had a lower linear dose response range than the EDR film, the efficacy of each film type depends on dose range, the XV being used predominantly for planar dose maps and EDR for combined axial dose maps. High dose lines (matchline effect) were studied with film measurement. Matchlines were caused by a contribution of extra penumbral dose from MLC transmission due to curved leaf ends. An MLC bank leaf stepping program was used with various minor overlap values (0, 0.06, 0.1, 0.14, 0.2 cm) of MLC position. With confirmation by BEAMnrc Monte Carlo simulations, a dosimetric overlap value due to collective effect of scatter and the rounded leaf end transmission equivalent to 0.09 cm leaf overlap was found for a particular weighting of each segment. Note the physical offset value set to avoid leaf collision is an additional 0.05 cm. An overlapping co-incident field technique was used to extend field size, this also showed a small jaw-leaf matchline effect at both edges of an overlap region. An aSi-EPID combined with Varian dosimetry software also showed matchline resolution similar to film. The aSi-EPID, XV film, Pinnacle RTP (version 7.0g and 7.4) and BEAMnrc Monte Carlo were all compared for a 25 segment step and shoot IMRT distribution. IMRT doses in the axial plane were further verified with an I&#65533;mRT phantom (Scanditronix-Wellhofer) using the EDR and a new low dose radiochromic film (Gafchromic&#65533; EBT, Lot no. 34267-004). For the irradiated perpendicular calibration setup, dose agreed to within &#61617;5% (1 SD) for EDR and '4% (1 SD) for Gafchromic' EBT film with RTP and an ionization chamber. The conclusions based on this thesis are the following; The matchlines represented a potential overdose to some small volumes within the target dose delivery. The matchline patterns produced by moving leaf banks in known sequences helped reveal the physics properties of the rounded leaf end. Appropriate physical leaf gaps were found to mask the matchline, however due to differences in segment weights these were not recommended. A Monte Carlo model of the Varian 120 MLC was developed using Beam NRC and this model predicted matchline effects. EPID dosimetry revealed an a-Si detector array had sufficient spacial resolution to show matchlines. Late in cycle Version 7.4 of RTP computer leaf model did predict matchlines of smaller magnitude than experimental results.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fault lines in the World Trade Organization: An analysis of the TRIPS agreement and developing countries</field><field name="creator">Shanker, Daya</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the role and position of developing countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in relation to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The analysis was done through three case studies involving major developing countries such as Brazil, India and Argentina, major developed country such as the USA and the regional trading bloc, the EC. The case studies identified a number of areas of conflict such as the exemptions under Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licensing under Article 31 of TRIPS, the exhaustion of rights after sale of the patented products along with parallel imports, local working, and the role of competition policy to deal with the abuses arising out of patenting monopolies. The case studies were followed by two chapters dealing with attempts to resolve the conflicts through the Dispute Settlement System of the WTO and the Ministerial Conference. The significant developments in this regard have been the WTO Panel Report in Canada-Protection of Pharmaceutical Patents removing object and purpose from interpretations of the TRIPS Agreement, paras 4 and 5 of the Doha Declaration (Ministerial Declaration at Doha dealing with Public Health) restoring object and purpose in interpreting the provisions of the Treaty Agreement as per customary rule of treaty interpretations and the Paragraph 6 solution of 30th August 2003 introducing export of the patented products as one of the rights under patents. The analysis suggests that developing countries have a limited role to play in such negotiations and interpretations of international treaty such as the TRIPS Agreement and their participation in such negotiations and interpretations is not very effective. The last part of this thesis deals with recommendations and suggests that suitable competition provisions in the legal system of developing countries may prevent or lessen abuses originating from patenting monopolies including issues of parallel trade, discriminatory pricing and non-local working.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedded lossless audio coding using linear prediction and cascade coding</field><field name="creator">Adistambha, Kevin</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the techniques and feasibility of embedding a perceptual audio coder within a lossless compression scheme. The goal is to provide for two step scalability in the resulting bitstream, where both a perceptual version of the audio signal and a lossless version of the same signal are provided in the one bitstream. The focus of this thesis is the selection of the perceptual coder to be used as the perceptual base layer and the techniques to be used to compress the lossless layer by using backward linear prediction followed by entropy coding. The perceptual base layer used is MPEG-4 AAC, chosen based on entropy measurements of the residual signal. Results of the work in this thesis show that the embedded lossless coding scheme could achieve an average compression ratio of only 6% larger compared to lossless only coding. Performing decorrelation on the AAC residual signal by means of backward linear predictive coding and measuring the entropy of the resulting LPC residual signal of various orders revealed that an 8% decrease in coding rate is achievable using 15th order prediction. Furthermore, this thesis also investigates an entropy coding technique known as cascade coding which is originally designed to compress hydroacoustic image data and is modified to compress audio data. Cascade coding is an entropy coding technique that uses multiple cascaded stages where each stage codes a specific range of integers and is used to perform entropy coding of the backward linear prediction residual signal. The cascade coding technique explored in this thesis includes using a frame based approach and trained codebooks.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic aircraft recognition and identification</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jijoong</field><field name="description">Aircraft recognition remains a challenging problem despite a great deal of effort to automate the recognition process. The majority of the aircraft recognition methods assume the successful isolation of the aircraft silhouette from the background, and only a few have actually addressed real world concerns, such as occlusion, clutter and shadows. This thesis presents an automatic aircraft recognition system, which shows improved performance with complex images. This system assumes from the start that the image could possibly be degraded, contain occlusions, clutter, camouflage, shadows and blurring. It is designed to tolerate and overcome the degradations at various analysis stages. The first part of the thesis focuses on the generic aircraft recognition problem using a generic description of aircraft parts and the geometric relationships that exist among them. The system implements line groupings in a hierarchical fashion, progressively leading towards a generic aircraft structure. A voting scheme is used to consolidate line groupings belonging to an aircraft while discouraging the formation of spurious line groupings. The aircraft identification process is carried out in the second part of the thesis, where the generically recognised aircraft is matched to model candidates. Model matching is carried out via pixellevel silhouette boundary matching. The system is tested on numerous real aircraft, scaled-down model aircraft and non-aircraft images with adverse image conditions. The developed system achieves a recognition rate of 84% at a false alarm rate of 7% on real aircraft images, and an correct matching rate of about 90% and a false matching rate of 7% on the generically recognised aircraft from model aircraft images.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical solutions for modeling soft soil consolidation by vertical drains</field><field name="creator">Walker, Rohan</field><field name="description">Vertical drains increase the rate of soil consolidation by providing a short horizontal drainage path for pore water flow, and are used worldwide in many soft soil improvement projects. This thesis develops three new contributions to the solution of consolidation problems: (i) a more realistic representation of the smear zone where soil properties vary gradually with radial distance from the vertical drain; (ii) a nonlinear radial consolidation model incorporating void ratio dependant soil properties and non-Darcian flow; and (iii) a solution to multi-layered consolidation problems with vertical and horizontal drainage using the spectral method. Each model is verified against existing analytical solutions and laboratory experiments conducted at the University of Wollongong, NSW Australia. The nonlinear radial consolidation model and the spectral method are verified against two trial embankments involving surcharge and vacuum loading at the Second Bangkok International Airport, Thailand. The versatility of the spectral method model is further demonstrated by analysing ground subsidence associated with ground water pumping in the Saga Plain, Japan. New expressions for the smear zone parameter, based on a linear and parabolic variation of soil properties in the radial direction, give a more realistic representation of the extent of smear and suggest that smear zones may overlap. Overlapping linear smear zones provide some explanation for the phenomena of a minimum drain spacing, below which no increase in the rate of consolidation is achieved. It appears this minimum influence radius is 0.6 times the size of the linear smear zone. The new smear zone parameters may be used with consolidation models (ii) and (iii), as mentioned above. The analytical solution to nonlinear radial consolidation is valid for both Darcian and non-Darcian flow and can capture the behaviour of both overconsolidated and normally consolidated soils. For nonlinear material properties, consolidation may be faster or slower when compared to the cases with constant material properties. The difference depends on the compressibility/permeability ratios (Cc/Ck and Cr/Ck), the preconsolidation pressure and the stress increase. If Cc/Ck &amp;less than 1 or Cr/Ck &amp;less than 1 then the coefficient of consolidation increases as excess pore pressures dissipate and consolidation is faster. The multi-layered consolidation model includes both vertical and radial drainage where permeability, compressibility and vertical drain parameters vary linearly with depth. The ability to include surcharge and vacuum loads that vary with depth and time allows for a large variety of consolidation problems to be analysed. The powerful model can also predict consolidation behaviour before and after vertical drains are installed and has potential for nonlinear consolidation analysis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperature effects on human leptin physiology: possible implications for the regulation of body composition</field><field name="creator">Zeyl, Annerieke</field><field name="description">In this study evidence has been sought for physiologically-significant, direct, local effects of reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue temperature on leptin as a possible mechanism for body composition regulation in response to environmental temperature. Twelve healthy males participated in 15 repeated cold-water immersions (study 1), human subcutaneous adipose tissue fragments (n=7) were incubated at 27&#65533;, 32&#65533; and 37&#65533;C (study 2) and fourteen healthy subjects underwent two cold-water immersions with and without the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (study 3). The first series of in vivo immersions were conducted over 15 days (60-90 min at 18&#65533;C). Acute cold exposure suppressed plasma leptin concentration (25 min: -14%, 60 min: -22%, P&amp;lessthan0.05), whilst repeated cold-water immersion was associated with an increase of plasma leptin concentration relative to test day 1 (+19% day 8, +13% day 15, overall P&amp;less than0.05). Leptin secretion in vitro decreased 3.7-fold as the incubation temperature decreased from 37&#65533; to 27&#65533;C (P&amp;lessthan0.05). In a compartmental model of leptin turnover in vivo, the measured (local) temperature effect on leptin secretion in vitro was more than able to account for the observed cold-induced decrease in leptin concentration in vivo. In the second series, of cold-water immersions beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol, which almost completely abolished cold induced release of non-esterified fatty acids (P&amp;lessthan0.05), did not prevent the cold-induced decrease in plasma leptin concentrations (P&amp;greaterthan0.05). This latter result suggests that the sympathetic nervous system may be less important in cold-induced regulation of plasma leptin concentration than previously assumed. The presented studies provide several lines of evidence for a role of leptin in energy balance regulation in response to environmental temperature. It is concluded that that local and direct effects of reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue temperature may be a more important contributor to the acute effects observed in vivo, than the sympathetically-mediated suppression of leptin secretion.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacophore development and validation for inhibitors of the bacterial NorA efflux pump</field><field name="creator">Dupree, Tom</field><field name="description">Using a series of known inhibitors of the bacterial NorA efflux pump and the pharmacophore generation program CATALYST&#65533; the first predictive pharmacophore for inhibitors of this pump has been developed. The pharmacophore consists of 3 hydrophobic features, a ring aromatic feature, 16 excluded volumes and one hydrogen bond acceptor. This pharmacophore was subsequently used to search the NCI database for new compound leads and also for de novo design. Two 1,4-naphthoquinones and an aromatic azo compound were identified as possible leads from the NCI database of compounds. These compounds were tested for NorA efflux inhibition in Staphylococcus aureus and they showed inhibitory activity. The de novo design process identified a number of new biaryl ether and biaryl ketone target compounds as potential inhibitors. A biaryl ether target 2-[3-(3-methoxyphenoxy)phenyl]isoindoline-1,3-dione, was synthesised by a concise three step process. This compound showed moderate NorA pump inhibitory activity in Staphylococcus aureus, using berberine as the antibacterial pump substrate. Thus this biaryl ether could serve as the starting point for a new class of inhibitors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of fine-scale environmental heterogeneity in determining levels of genotypic diversity and local adaptation</field><field name="creator">Sherman, Craig D. H</field><field name="description">Fine-scale environmental heterogeneity is predicted to be important in determining variation in genotypic diversity and in selection for important life history traits in natural populations. For example, theory suggests that organisms with complex life histories that involve both sexual and asexual modes of reproduction use sex to produce genotypically diverse and widely dispersed propagules for the colonisation of distant or unstable habitats, but rely on asexual reproduction to restock or maintain populations within their parental habitat. Such organisms should also have great potential for site-specific adaptation as multiple generations may compete within relatively static conditions. Surprisingly, little is still known about the importance of fine-scale genotypic variation and the degree of local adaptation within populations of clonal marine organisms. In this study, I used two brooding corals (Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix) and one brooding sea anemone (Actinia tenebrosa), to test for evidence of fine-scale adaptation and the effects of environmental heterogeneity on variation in genotypic diversity. Using a combination of genetic and experimental techniques I assessed: i) if reproductive mode varies with environmental heterogeneity across habitats, ii) how genotypic diversity varies over fine spatial scales (centimetres and meters), and iii) if different clonal genotypes show evidence of fine-scale adaptation to specific habitats. My data on the population genetics and mode of reproduction for the corals P. damicornis and S. hystrix did not support theoretical predictions. Brooded larvae from P. damicornis colonies collected in five reef habitats were all produced asexually. In contrast, brooded larvae of Seriatopora hystrix were sexually produced, with up to three sires contributing to some broods (rp (&#65533;SE) = 0.32 &#65533; 0.43), and almost half (46%) of the larvae resulting from self-fertilisation (mean outcrossing rates were tm (&#65533;SE) = 0.54 &#65533; 0.22). The population genetic structure of S. hystrix from One Tree Island matched that expected from the mating system; i.e. a high level of genetic subdivision due to restricted dispersal of gametes, and consistent heterozygote deficits within populations associated with inbreeding. However, populations of P. damicornis showed unexpectedly high levels of genotypic diversity and appear to be maintained by sexual reproduction; Go/Ge ranged from 69 to 100% of that expected for random mating within 14 sites across six habitats. Interestingly, at three sites in two habitats Go/Ge ranged from 35 to 53%. Two of these sites were recently bleached, suggesting that asexual recruitment may be favoured after disturbance, although disturbance alone is probably insufficient to explain this species&#65533; continued investment in clonal reproduction. Using a combination of variable microsatellite and allozyme markers, I assessed the genetic origin of brooded juveniles from adult Actinia tenebrosa collected from boulder and rock pool habitats to determine if the mode of reproduction varied with environment. Brooded juveniles displayed identical multi-locus genotypes to that of the brood parent, irrespective of habitat type or location. However, I found that the level of genotypic diversity varied widely among 19 A. tenebrosa populations across 2500km of its geographic range along the east coast of Australia. Some populations showing high levels of clonality while others displayed the level of genotypic diversity expected for sexual reproduction. For A. tenebrosa, my results indicate that the importance of sexual and asexual reproduction may indeed vary among habitats with different levels of heterogeneity confirming predictions from evolutionary theory. Fine-scale genetic surveys (&amp;lt1m2) on the distribution of clones of A. tenebrosa revealed that clonal diversity was greater on individual boulders (71%) compared to rock pools (23%). However, samples collected over larger spatial scales (25m2) revealed little difference in genotypic diversity between boulder (80%) and rock pool habitats (70%). Clones had limited distributions, although some could be spread throughout an entire habitat. With the exception of a single clone, I found no overlap of genotypes between boulder and rock pool habitats on the same rocky shore. This distinct segregation of genotypes to habitats within the same rocky shore may result either from highly limited dispersal of asexual propagules and/or fine-scale selection for certain genotypes in particular habitats. To test for evidence of local adaptation to fine-scale environmental variation in different habitats, I reciprocally transplanted A. tenebrosa both within and between habitats. I found no evidence of adaptation of clones within habitats, with transplanted anemones performing equally well to native anemones in terms of survivorship (F1, 0.01 = 11.79, P = 0.075), proportion of adults brooding juveniles (F1, 0.01 = 0.40, P = 0.592), mean number of juveniles/site (F1, 2281 = 0.801, P = 0.068), mean number of juveniles/brood (F1, 12.2 = 1.238, P = 0.382), and growth (F1, 0.03 = 0.007, P = 0.942). However, between-habitat transplants provided evidence that clones of A. tenebrosa are locally adapted at the habitat scale. Native anemones consistently out-performed foreign anemones transplanted from the adjacent habitat (survivorship F2, 0.298 = 9.58, P &lt; 0.001; proportion adults brooding F2, 0.139 = 3.12, P = 0.05; mean number of juveniles/site F2, 14039 = 3.90, P = 0.028; growth F2, = 4.77, P = 0.014). In summary, the results from this study show little evidence that reproductive mode varies predictably among habitats for any of the three species tested. Furthermore, there appears to be a mismatch between the population genetic structure and the reproductive output for two of the three species. Level of genotypic diversity was shown to vary over different spatial scales, and with habitat to some degree, both in P. damicornis and A. tenebrosa, and transplant experiments provide evidence of fine-scale adaptation to specific habitats for A. tenebrosa. These results suggest that for some species, such as the brooding sea anemone Actinia tenebrosa, the importance of sexual and asexual reproduction may indeed vary among habitats with different environmental heterogeneity in the manner predicted by evolutionary theory.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Gulf of Carpentaria palaeoenvironments: OSL dating and nannofossil evidence</field><field name="creator">Couapel, Martine Jeanine Josette</field><field name="description">The Gulf of Carpentaria is a near-equatorial region, a domain in which past environmental changes are not well understood, but in which much of the world's weather has its origin. Being situated adjacent to the Western Pacific Warm Pool, responsible for the largest transfer of heat and moisture between the surface and the atmosphere, the Gulf of Carpentaria is an epicontinental sea (maximum depth 70 m) bordered to the east by Torres Strait (12 m depth) and to the west by the deeper Arafura Sill (53 m depth), an area sensitive to the Asian monsoon and ENSO, which have a crucial importance on a worldwide scale. Furthermore, this region could be a key point to monitor the palaeocirculation between the Pacific and the Indian oceans that records the switching on and off of the global thermohaline circulation during glacial/interglacial alternations. The Gulf is tectonically stable, therefore no corrections are necessary when interpreting the palaeo-sea level curve. Throughout the Late Quaternary, during times of sea-level low-stands, the gulf was separated from the open waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans, forming Lake Carpentaria with outlet channels to the Arafura Sea. In 1997, six sediment cores were collected from the Gulf of Carpentaria using a giant piston-corer deployed from the Marion Dufresne, as part of the International MArine Global changEs Study (IMAGES). This study provides an interpretation of the palaeoenvironments in the Gulf of Carpentaria over the last 180 ka by means of OSL dating and analysis of abundance and distribution of coccolith assemblages within this series of sediment cores. The usefulness of the OSL Dating technique on such sediment cores covering marine to lacustrine conditions has been demonstrated by establishing a time frame for the changing environments of the Gulf of Carpentaria since MIS 6.6. The shallowness of the Gulf of Carpentaria, as well as its restricted basin size, allow the use of Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to date the sediment. Indeed, these parameters mean that the quartz grains were bleached soon before deposition and thus that the event date is the real time of deposition. From the thirteen samples processed, twelve dates ranging from 7 &#65533; 1 to 178 &#65533; 18 ka, have been estimated over three cores from the Gulf of Carpentaria. These dates also allow the calculation of the sedimentation rate, which ranges from 4.3 cm ka-1 in the central area to 7.8 cm ka-1on the western margin. These results are consistent with the modern sedimentation rate observed in the Gulf of Carpentaria. A clear reduction in the sedimentation rate starting about 90-100 ka ago is noticed in the three cores, however this needs to be confirmed by further dating on other levels. Coccolithophores are planktonic marine algae distributed from the open ocean to nearshore littoral and lagoonal environments. They secrete minute calcified plates, coccoliths, which are a major component of pelagic carbonates. Coccolith assemblages preserved in marine sediments are excellent proxies of palaeoceanographic conditions. The lack of coccoliths could be either due to bad preservation conditions or to a freshwater environment. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, coccolith assemblages confirm at least two non-marine/marine cycles, during the past 180 ka, as well as some short marine intervals, as minor incursions of seawater during a non-marine sequence. These collated results are presented on a series of maps illustrating the discrete closure and breach sequences of the Arafura Sill and Torres Strait as related to Quaternary sea level fluctuations, and the corresponding alternations between the Gulf of Carpentaria and Lake Carpentaria. When viewed together, the compilation and interpretation of these data enables the development of a detailed spatial and temporal understanding of the palaeoenvironmental history of the Gulf of Carpentaria since MIS 6.6 (ca. 180 ka). From the sedimentary record of the Gulf evidence of dry and wetter episodes are observed and interpreted as intensification of the monsoon and cyclonic activity. These may be linked to ENSO events and global oceanic and atmospheric processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equity issues in ICT in higher education: the experience of mature-age rural women</field><field name="creator">Meyers, Wendy</field><field name="description">Recent research has acknowledged equity problems in higher education associated with the use of online learning technologies.

I begin by suggesting that, although realist risk analysis currently dominates environmental decision-making on recombinant DNA technologies, the existence of contested values and widespread scientific uncertainty challenge the adequacy of this approach. What an appropriate approach to regulatory decision-making under these conditions would involve is then used as a guiding question to survey literature on risk and uncertainty from a range of social science disciplines. Through this survey, a theoretical framework is synthesised where the ends of a spectrum of stances taken towards environmental decision-making are contrastingly described as traditional 'science/risk' and emerging 'precaution/uncertainty' based approaches. After describing the important components of precaution/uncertainty based approaches and suggesting that they represent a more appropriate way to orient environmental decision-making on GM crops, I then analyse Australia's regulatory framework in terms of where it can be positioned along the science/risk - precaution/uncertainty spectrum. Exploring the key distinguishing themes of the discourse of decision-making, the role awarded science, the avenues for public participation, the requirements for ongoing research and monitoring, and the range of policy options considered, I argue that Australia's environmental regulation of GM crops currently represents a predominantly science/risk based approach to decision-making. With the process of 'objective' scientific risk assessment shown to be central in Australia's environmental regulation of GM crops, I then perform a detailed deconstruction of a case study risk assessment - the impact of Bt cotton on non-target organisms. Using criteria developed to explore the analytical themes of the reliability of cited scientific studies, how scientific information was used and the adequacy/appropriateness of the conclusions drawn, the thesis provides a detailed example of 'extended peer review'. This review challenges the objectivity of the risk assessment process, demonstrates the value of social science analyses of science for policy and offers a framework to help advance these forms of investigation. Through this research, I critically appraise Australia's environmental regulation of GM crops, present recommendations for how it could be improved, and provide practical and theoretical frameworks to assist the development of robust processes for environmental decision-making.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-term effects of altering the dietary carbohydrate to fat ratio on circulating leptin and satiety in women</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Michelle A</field><field name="description">Overweight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions and appetite control may be important for its clinical management. Leptin is a plasma protein secreted from adipose tissue that is involved in body weight regulation. The role of leptin in regulating human appetite is not well established. Human feeding studies report that an increased dietary carbohydrate to fat ratio is associated with increased circulating leptin concentrations compared to a decreased dietary carbohydrate to fat ratio. These investigations have generally used diets with extreme variations in macronutrient intake that do not represent normal patterns of consumption. Whether less extreme variations in macronutrient intake have similar effects on circulating leptin and whether there is a relationship with satiety under these conditions is not established. The overall aim of this research was to determine the potential clinical relevance of the effects of altering the dietary carbohydrate to fat ratio on circulating leptin concentrations. Methods: Three short-term controlled human feeding studies were conducted involving 68 female subjects (age 37 - 9 (SD) yrs, BMI 26.8 - 4.1 kg/m2). Study 1 and Study 2 were single-blind parallel design trials where realistic high carbohydrate (carbohydrate:fat= 60:20) or high fat (carbohydrate:fat= 40:40) iso-caloric diets were provided. Study 3 was a double-blind cross-over trial where high carbohydrate (carbohydrate:fat= 60:20) and extreme high fat (carbohydrate:fat= 25:55) diets were provided. The primary outcomes were fasting leptin concentrations and subjective satiety measured on a multi-dimensional and single-dimension visual analogue scales. In Study 3 ad libitum intake was also assessed at a post-intervention buffet breakfast. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to analyse the effect of the intervention diets over time on the outcome measures. Results: There was no between group difference in fasting leptin concentrations when realistic high carbohydrate and high fat controlled diets were consumed in Study 1 and Study 2 (p&gt;0.4). This finding was similar when leptin concentrations were adjusted for body composition. Within subjects, changes in recent dietary carbohydrate and fat intake predicted a decrease in leptin concentrations during the intervention, but effects were small. A weak linear relationship between leptin concentrations and subjective satiety score was detected in Study 1 (p=0.06), but no relationship was detected in Study 2 and Study 3 (p&gt;0.7). In Study 3 the more extreme high fat diet reduced leptin concentrations by 21% relative to the high carbohydrate diet (time*diet interaction, p&lt;0.01). There was no influence of this difference in leptin concentration on ad libitum energy or macronutrient intake at the buffet breakfast (95% CI for difference in energy intake -411kJ to 190kJ). Conclusions: Circulating leptin concentrations are influenced by dietary carbohydrate to fat ratio such that decreasing the carbohydrate content of the diet results in decreased circulating leptin concentrations. However, the potential clinical relevance of this finding to the management of overweight and obesity is likely to be limited as i) extreme dietary patterns are necessary to detect this effect, ii) leptin concentrations were not related to subjective satiety score and iii) differences in leptin concentrations did not influence ad libitum food intake. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings over longer time frames, with different subject groups, twenty four hour blood sampling and ad libitum intake over the entire day.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is plasminogen deployed as a virulence factor by Northern Territory group A streptococcal isolates during invasive disease?</field><field name="creator">McKay, Fiona Catherine</field><field name="description">Group A streptococcal (S. pyogenes; GAS) infection is endemic in the Northern Territory of Australia, and the rates of invasive GAS disease and post-infection sequelae are among the highest reported in the world. Plasminogen is a potent human protease sequestered to the GAS cell-surface by plasminogen and fibrinogen receptors and activated by GAS streptokinase and host plasminogen activators. The critical role of plasminogen in GAS invasion was recently demonstrated in a human plasminogen transgenic mouse model of infection.The aim of this study was to determine whether plasminogen is deployed as a virulence factor in invasive GAS disease, with particular reference to the Northern Territory of Australia. This question was first approached from an epidemiological perspective, comparing Northern Territory GAS isolates from invasive infections with those from uncomplicated infections for their interaction with the plasminogen system. Plasminogen binding; plasminogen receptor expression and genetic variation; fibrinogen binding; streptokinase expression, activity and genetic variation; streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) expression and activity; and acquisition of cell-surface plasmin in human plasma were characterised for 29 GAS isolates of known clinical origin from the Northern Territory. The second approach to determining the role of plasminogen in invasive disease in the Northern Territory was to investigate GAS infection using a human plasminogen transgenic mouse model. A subset of Northern Territory GAS isolates selected for different in vitro plasminogen activation characteristics was tested for virulence in this model.This study revealed that Northern Territory GAS isolates from invasive disease cases acquire more plasminogen than isolates from uncomplicated infections, however they do not produce more streptokinase nor acquire more cell-surface plasmin after incubation in human plasma in vitro. Presence of the gene for the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM) conferred upon GAS isolates a strikingly different profile of interaction with plasminogen, characterised by higher plasminogen binding and plasmin acquisition in plasma. Differences in the catalytic specificity of streptokinase secreted by pam-positive and pam-negative isolates were identified and their allelic determinants investigated. A new model of GAS cell-surface plasminogen activation is proposed for pam-positive isolates. To characterise the role of streptokinase and the cysteine protease SpeB in acquisition of cell-surface plasmin activity in human plasma, such acquisition was compared in GAS deletion mutants for genes encoding these proteins and the corresponding wildtype strains. The dramatic reduction of GAS cell-surface plasmin activity by SpeB may significantly disable GAS invasive potential. Infection studies in the human plasminogen transgenic mouse model revealed the critical role of plasminogen in virulence of some Northern Territory isolates, however in vitro plasminogen activation characteristics do not predict clinical phenotype nor virulence in the transgenic mouse model. The results suggest an important and complex interaction between plasminogen and other host and/or bacterial factors in establishing invasive GAS infection in the Northern Territory of Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of immature blowflies and their application to forensic science</field><field name="creator">Day, Donnah Marie</field><field name="description">Data on the development of immature blowflies and other carrion-breeding flies can assist with determination of the post-mortem interval and thus be used as a tool to help solve crime. The main focus of this research was to develop reliable data for growth at constant temperatures in larvae of Calliphora augur. Constant temperatures were chosen because fluctuating regimes can be location specific and may therefore have limited application. A number of other blowfly species were also studied, but only C. augur and Lucilia cuprina were used in planned experiments. Since C. augur is ovoviviparous, and therefore has a small clutch size, the fecund egg-laying species Lucilia cuprina was also cultured and used as a model for pilot experiments, in feasibility studies and to explore the broader applicability of results from trials with C. augur. Some of the current ideas behind estimation of post-mortem interval using blowfly larvae have been expanded upon and prediction intervals for larvae of C. augur are presented. In forensic entomology, plots of this type usually present the variables differently than the strict mathematical method, where a known predictor (x) is used to estimate an unknown value of interest (y). In forensic entomology, these axes are often reversed. In my work, I have adopted a more classical mathematical method and present a way of estimating time as related to larval age (y) from the (known) somatic measurement of body length (x). Whilst this has been the main core of my work, some important practical difficulties of working in this field have also been given attention. A way to salvage some damaged specimens has been discovered; measurement of body width at the junction of the 5th and 6th abdominal segments can be used as an alternative measurement to body length, and I present a means to convert from one measurement to the other. A paper on this topic has been published in Forensic Science International. I have also explored the effect of freezing and thawing developmental media on larval growth in Calliphora augur and Lucilia cuprina, and it appears that there is no significant difference. The effect of different tissues from sheep on larval growth was also examined in the above two species, with growth on sheep's liver being slower than growth on sheep's brain or sheep's meat. A paper on this topic has been accepted by the Journal of Forensic Sciences. The effect of preservative solutions on different larval stages of C. augur, and on the third instar larvae of C.augur and L. cuprina, was also examined. It was found that the larvae of each species reacted differently to the preservatives, as did the different instars within a species. Ten per cent formalin and Kahle's solution effected the least change in larval body length, but when larvae were placed into preservatives alive only 10% formalin had no deleterious effect on both species. However, since 10% formalin can affect the analysis of larval DNA, it is not recommended. In fact, it appears that choosing an optimum preservative may be difficult until more work is done in this area. While work in forensic entomology is far from straightforward, it is hoped that the decidedly practical nature of my studies will serve to equip forensic entomologists with more tools to help solve crime.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early adolescent peer-social attributional style and socio-emotional adjustment: a prospective analysis</field><field name="creator">Toner, Mark A</field><field name="description">Although there has been substantial investigation of the association between general attributional style and depression in adolescence, little research has examined the relationship between attributional tendencies specific to the peer-social domain and socio-emotional adjustment. A handful of studies suggest that adolescent peer-social attributional tendencies are related to certain aspects of socio-emotional adjustment, namely, loneliness, depression, and self-reported victimisation. However, this research has been of a concurrent nature and thus demonstrated no causal relationship. The studies to be reported here examined the nature of attributions for peer-social events in early adolescence and the concurrent and longitudinal associations of individual differences in peer-social attributional tendencies with indicators of socio-emotional adjustment. Two longitudinal studies were undertaken; both using similar instruments to assess attributional style for peer-related events. The first study took place over a shorter period (12 months) and used a smaller sample (n = 36 completing the study) than the second study (24 months, n = 82 completing the study). The first study assessed attributions via a personal interview protocol, which allowed respondents to articulate their attributions for the 12 hypothetical scenarios presented to them. Respondents rated these attributions on three scales representing causal internality, stability and globality. The second study presented 14 scenarios and required respondents only to rate the cause of each on the same rating scales. The three primary dependent variables in both studies were self-reported feelings of victimisation, loneliness, and depression assessed via an emotional adjustment questionnaire largely based on the Birleson Depression Scale and the Illinois Loneliness Questionnaire. The second study also involved a peer-reported measure of social status as an additional dependent variable, namely, social centrality derived from the SCM procedure. Results of Study 1 showed a predominance of attributions to others' feelings and motives. Other prominent attributional factors were relationship factors, which were particularly used to explain positive events. Attributions that equate with common attributions made for achievement events (such as personal characteristics and actions) were used relatively infrequently. Mean ratings of these attributions on the three attributional dimensions was also examined. In Study 1, attributional style was operationalised both in terms of the relative usage of attributional types as well as in terms of ratings on the attributional dimensions. Few associations between relative usage of attributional types and socio-emotional adjustment were evident. There were more associations between attributional ratings and socio-emotional adjustment. In particular, significant concurrent and longitudinal associations were found between poorer adjustment and causal stability for negative events, a composite of stable and global attributions for negative events and a bivalent composite for stable and global attributions. Study 2 found yet more associations between ratings on attributional dimensions and emotional adjustment. In contrast to Study 1, causal internality for positive events and a composite measure indicating the relative absence of self-serving attributional bias, was concurrently associated with loneliness and victimisation. There were also concurrent associations between stable and global attributions for negative events and both depression and victimisation. Longitudinal associations between these measures were evident in the correlational analysis. However, the major composite variables were not significant predictors of emotional adjustment when Time 1 adjustment was controlled in a multivariate analysis. In both studies, there was significant intercorrelation between the stability and globality scales independent of event valence. Post hoc analyses showed that a total generality composite measuring stable and global attribution for both positive and negative events predicted both loneliness and depression despite not being concurrently associated with these variables. Moreover, a comparison of groups based on Time 1 total generality showed that the high generality group was significantly higher in Time 2 maladjustment despite not differing from lower generality groups at Time 1. This group also showed increased emotional difficulties at Time 2 whereas the average and low generality groups remained stable or showed slight decreases. A possible explanation for the increased emotional maladjustment associated with the generality style is advanced. It is suggested that the unstable and unique nature of the peer-social domain in early adolescence means that stable and global attributions are generally inaccurate and lead to unrealistically low and/or high expectations. The mismatch of expectancies that emanates from this attributional style and ensuing events contributes to negative affect. The association between social centrality and attributional style was limited. There were no concurrent differences between social centrality (or status) groups. Some longitudinal associations were evident, but the most maladaptive attributional tendencies at Time 1 were found amongst individuals who attained secondary (or average) social centrality at Time 2 rather than those of lower status (peripheral/isolate). This was inconsistent with findings indicating an association between peer-social attributional tendencies and lower sociometric status in children and preadolescents. Both studies are evaluated and directions for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A moral law for the jungle: a Kantian exploration in corporate environmental ethics</field><field name="creator">Sack, Fabian P. D.</field><field name="description">Almost global acknowledgement of environmental crisis and social inequity suggest a secular revision of Kantian moral philosophy embracing sustainability. By eschewing subjective preferences as the foundation of morality Kant avoids an aspect of corporate responsibility that has otherwise proved intractable. Corporations, as artificial and disembodied agents, cannot depend on desires or intuitions to guide their actions. Kant's moral theory avoids subjective preferences that arbitrarily exclude our environments, communities or future generations from moral relevance and corporations from moral responsibility. Kant says: 'Let no one think that here the trivial 'quod tibi no vis fieri, etc.' [Don't do unto others what you don't want done to yourself] can serve as a standard or principle.' The problem with this golden rule, which the empirical tradition takes as the central statement of ethics, is that it bases morality on shared preferences. In the process the golden rule excludes our environments from moral consideration and corporations from the scope of moral accountability: Neither corporate nor environmental preferences are commensurate with those of humans. In place of this biblical injunction Kant offers a law whose effect Kantians have characterised by the adage 'What if everyone did that?' Kant's moral law uses the proscriptive universalization implicit in moral language and practice to make efficacy the basis of morality. Strictly, the only practical conclusion that Kant's argument leads to is that agents' moral action is defined by the universalizability of their maxims and reciprocally, that universalizability is defined by agents' ability to choose actions. Used as a test of right actions, Kant's moral law is very sensitive to the way in which proposed actions that provide it content are described. Contrary to recent interpretation, Kant's maxims are not teleological descriptions; they functionally describe those aspects of an action that are intended to serve interests. Act descriptions put to the test that fail to capture the relevant intention proclaim 'Do as I say, not as I do' and are not maxims. Moral appraisal of any sort implies a procedural sanction against self-deception that avoids false moral judgements: Honesty effectively corrects for bias in describing maxims, allowing immoral proposed actions to be proscribed. Kant notes that 'the proposition, 'Honesty is the best policy' is beyond all refutation, and is the indispensable condition of all policy'. By introducing glosses on the kinds of actions humans propose to the moral law Kant's theory guides corporate action towards sustainability. Kant argues that the idea of reason shared by humanity at any time is the core of political theory and ethics. Kant's anthropology means that the limits of moral consideration remain open: By asking 'How would it look to others?' maxims consider all interests (including non-human interests) and the process of universalization ensures that consideration extends both forwards and backwards in time. Imposing this moral law on corporations can be justified on pragmatic grounds, it is sensitive to environmental, historical and cultural contexts as well as the implications for future generations: Corporate 'Virtue is its own reward'. As a moral proscription test the moral law self-corrects through honesty and improved understanding. As we get to know more about the impact of corporate actions on other species or ecologies, on the future and on other cultures the process of universalization adjusts providing a self-correcting definition of what makes corporate actions unsustainable: A moral law for the jungle.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exegesis to support Heloise</field><field name="creator">Natalenko, Rie</field><field name="description">Heloise is a screenplay based on the true story of Heloise and Abelard, who lived in Paris in the twelfth century.

It is told in flashback from 1142, the year of Abelard's death. The accompanying exegesis addresses the research comprised in writing the screenplay. It explores the background information essential in establishing the historical context of the action. This includes the characteristics of the historical personages, which were extrapolated from their own writings and from what was written about them. Using this as a foundation, the requisite auxiliary characters could be created. The contemporaneous societal conditions, social attitudes and the philosophical beliefs of the time were studied in order for the background of the screenplay to be accurate in its historical contextualisation. The genre of the screenplay was determined by the nature of the story ' it is a historical romantic drama. However, comedic elements have been included in order to lighten the mood of the piece and create a contrast with the inevitable tragic ending. The second half of the exegesis explores current thinking on the craft of screenwriting, and discusses and clarifies my choices of approach and the process of writing.

This thesis investigated the distribution, speciation, binding phases and geochemical behaviour of selenium in Port Kembla Harbour sediments, which potentially receive selenium pollution from local metal processing and smelting and coal industries. Sedimentary selenium is a potential selenium source for fish and organisms via benthic food chain transfer. Grab surface sediments from 23 sites around the harbour and a total of 14 sediment cores were collected from the contaminated Red Beach area (during 2003-2006) and analysed for selenium concentrations by HG-AAS and also for sediment parameters including grain size composition, pH, redox potential, other trace metals, porewater composition and sediment macrocomponents. Two sequential extraction procedures were used to fractionate the solid-phase selenium into soluble and adsorbed, carbonate, metal oxyhydroxide, organically bound, elemental, organic matter and sulfide, and residual selenium fractions. The selenium behaviour in the different geochemical phases was examined in association with the measured sediment parameters. The selenium concentrations in surface sediments from most harbour sites were low (below 3 ug/g) except those in sediments from the Red Beach area (up to 9.38 ug/g), which is in close proximity to a local copper refinery. Selenium concentrations in the Red Beach sediment cores ranged from 6 to 1735 ug/g, depending on depth and grain size, with peak selenium concentrations observed at 6-10 cm and at 14-16 cm depths. The highest selenium concentration (1735 ug/g), found in the less than 63 um Red Beach sediments, was 100 times higher than the highest sedimentary selenium concentration previously reported in Australia. The sedimentary selenium was concentrated in fine (less than 63 um) grains that are easily mobile. Selenium was correlated mainly with Pb, Cu and Zn in the less than 250 um fraction of the surface sediments and in the less than 63 um fraction of the sediment cores, indicating association from both original ore sources and through post-depositional transformation. The sediment 210Pb dating estimated the sedimentation rate of Red Beach cores to be 0.55 u 0.03 cm/year. Sediment 210Pb dating provided an indication that the deeper sediments were not disturbed and high selenium concentrations in the sediment cores were a result of historical selenium input potentially from a copper smelter. The solid-phase selenium in the Red Beach sediment cores was present mainly as elemental selenium. High proportions of the selenium were also bound to the organic matter in the upper 10 cm region and associated with the residual fraction below 10 cm. Selenite was the major selenium species found in the organically bound selenium fraction. Small proportions of the solid-phase selenium were in soluble and adsorbed fractions, with peak concentrations in the below 10 cm depth region. Minimal amounts of selenium were found to associate with iron-manganese oxyhydroxides and carbonate minerals in the sediment. The Red Beach sediment cores were oxic in the top 2 cm and anoxic below 2 cm depths. The top 2 cm oxic sediment contained low solid-phase selenium concentrations and low porewater selenium concentrations. The anoxic 2-10 cm core region contained the peak solid-phase selenium concentrations but with low porewater selenium concentrations. This layer was enriched with the organic matter, AVS, organically bound selenium, and elemental selenium species, indicating a strong link between organic matter decay processes and the reduction of sulfate and selenium. The below 10 cm-anoxic sediments contained moderate solid-phase selenium, peak porewater selenium and high soluble and adsorbed selenium concentrations, and stable pyritic sulfur species. Selenium was observed to become associated with the residual fraction at the expense of the organically bound and the elemental selenium in this region. This below 10 cm region contained lower proportions of copper, lead and zinc in the residual fraction but significant amounts in the organically bound fractions. The solid-phase selenium correlated with the solid-phase sulfur through the association of their reduced forms: elemental selenium, pyrite and possibly as pyritic selenium. Copper was the only major element that co-extracted with elemental selenium. The reduced selenium forms (elemental and residual) correlated significantly with Cu, Pb and Zn, suggesting possible formation of independent CuSe, PbSe and ZnSe minerals in the sediment. Redox potential, sedimentation rate, organic matter components, sulfur and transition elements are concluded to be the important factors affecting the selenium geochemical behaviour in Red Beach cores.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In search of the inner voice: a qualitative exploration of the internalised use of aural, visual, kinaesthetic, and other imagery in the perception and performance of music</field><field name="creator">Saintilan, Nicole</field><field name="description">This study is about imagery, mostly sound imagery, but also a more complex set of imageries used by musicians in the perception and performance of music. Imagery is the internal representation of a stimulus, experienced in the presence or absence of that stimulus. Imagery may be of different types, such as visual (imagined seeing), auditory (imagined words or sounds), spatial (imagined distances or placement), or kinaesthetic (imagined movement). The thought processes that musicians use in this regard are not well-documented. This lack of knowledge contributes to the mystique that surrounds music literacy, a mystique that, in turn, does little to help student musicians develop useful strategies for performing and listening to music.The aim of the study in the first instance was to find out what types of thought processes musicians actively employ during their work. The research expanded progressively to become an exploration of the psychological and physical tools musicians use when they perform and listen to music. The underlying premise was that there is an inner voice with multiple manifestations, and that musicians have the capacity to generate such internal imagery.A review of the literature in this area showed the absence of a comprehensive description of the sounds that musicians are able to imagine in terms of range, speed, timbre, and complexity. Also lacking from the literature is a description of the differences in the feel of imagery, and the range of imagery skills that musicians combine when performing and listening to music. Thus the starting point for this thesis was the search for an inner voice.The research centred on a series of questionnaires and interviews with 10 experienced musicians over a 12-month period. In the course of these interviews the musicians were asked to comment on their imagery during different musical experiences such as thinking, listening, score reading, and performance. Their written and spoken answers were collated and compared to search for similarities and differences. The investigation became a sequential and in-depth search, as participant responses raised more and more issues and areas for enquiry.  Research Questions were developed progressively, subsequent to the initial two part theory having been operationalized. This stated that (a) the musician participants would be able to generate the impression of sound internally (i.e., inner sing), and (b) they would agree that there is more than one type of sound imagery.Although unable to generalise results due to the limitations inherent in research of this nature, the findings shed new light on previous inconsistencies in the literature, provide new knowledge and conceptualisations, clarify terminology, and have implications for the teaching of music in its various forms. The two main findings to emerge from the study are that musicians are likely to employ a variety of imagery types when they work and that they do so in significantly different and individual styles. The results demonstrate that the musicians relied on a wide variety of imagery, including imagery of movement and sound as well as visual imagery of instruments, hands, written music, and analytical representations of the music. The results further revealed the wide range of terminology used when musicians talk about their inner musical worlds. Where one musician may inner sing music, another may inner hear or inner perform, and the next may do something entirely different.These findings lead to several conclusions. It is incorrect to assume that any two musicians will think the same thoughts or use the same imagery when they hear or perform a piece of music. Moreover, differences that professional musicians display when imagining music may well be evident in students.  Expecting students to conform to one way or another when listening, performing, or thinking about music may be unrealistic or damaging. In gaining a more precise understanding of the inner voice of musicians, it becomes possible to set clear goals for the teaching of hitherto hidden skills. An accentuated awareness of individual differences in this regard holds within it the exciting prospect of full potential being reached by student musicians.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does homework improve outcomes for individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness?</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Peter James</field><field name="description">Homework refers to activities completed by individuals between therapeutic sessions which are designed to help them make progress toward their treatment goals (Deane, Glaser, Oades, &amp; Kazantzis, 2005; Kazantzis &amp; Lampropoulos, 2002b; Shelton &amp; Ackerman, 1974). Homework has been recommended for use by mental health case managers to help clients with severe mental illness (SMI; Glaser, Kazantzis, Deane, &amp; Oades, 2000; Turkington, Dudley, Warman, &amp; Beck, 2004). Research has not previously examined whether case managers routinely use homework or if homework improves outcomes for individuals with SMI. The aim of the current study was to examine case managers' homework practices and describe their attitudes towards the use of homework. It also examined the relationship between homework and client outcome. The research consisted of two related studies. Study 1 involved the distribution of a homework practices survey to 122 mental health case managers. Results indicated that 93% of case managers implemented homework, but only 15% regularly used a systematic approach to homework administration where they clearly specified the task and provided a written note for the client. On average case managers reported positive attitudes towards homework, predominately using a range of behaviourally based homework tasks. Study 2 was conducted as an effectiveness study and examined the actual use of homework by case managers working in clinical practice. Case managers were trained in a systematic approach to homework administration and were provided with carbonised Homework Administration Pads to assist with homework implementation. A Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) approach was used to examine the relationship between homework and outcome for all participants in the study (N = 242). The total number of homework assignments administered to each client and the quality of homework completion predicted improvement on the Health of Nation Outcome Measure (HoNOS). When examining just those individuals who were assigned homework (n = 129), the total number of homework assignments administered also predicted improvements on the Kessler 10 (K10). These results are supportive of the use of systematic homework administration procedures with individuals diagnosed with SMI. However, during the course of the 12-month study, 113 clients (47%) were not assigned homework using the Homework Assignment Pad. This suggests that promoting the consistent use of systematic homework procedures by case managers represents a considerable challenge. It is likely that there are a range of factors that influence case managers' use of homework. For example, current results suggest that case manager attitudes towards homework and the importance case managers' place on homework for SMI are likely to influence their implementation of systematic homework administration procedures. Additionally, attitudes represent just one aspect of social cognitive models of behaviour (e.g., Theory of Planned Behaviour; Ajzen, 1991). It is likely that homework administration is also influenced by beliefs case managers hold regarding subjective norms (e.g., managerial, supervisory or peer expectations) and perceived behavioural control with implementing the task (e.g., client acceptance of homework, sufficient time to administer homework). With homework offering considerable promise in supporting the recovery of people diagnosed with SMI, future work would benefit from examining strategies to promote the regular use of systematic homework administration procedures by mental health case managers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal oxides as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors</field><field name="creator">Lao, Zhou Jin</field><field name="description">Electrochemical capacitors are becoming attractive energy storage devices and fill the gap between batteries and conventional capacitors because they have higher energy density than conventional dielectric capacitors and have higher power density and a longer cycling life than batteries. In this study, transition metal oxides, such as Co3O4, NiO, V2O5 and MnO2, have been successfully synthesized by different chemical-based solution methods. Their physical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM, and BET analysis. The as-prepared Co3O4, NiO, V2O5 and MnO2 were investigated as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors and demonstrated very high specific capacitances, which were 168 F/g, 203 F/g, 262 F/g, and 406 F/g, respectively. This may be due to their large surface areas (Co3O4 (82 m2/g), NiO (90 m2/g), V2O5 (41 m2/g) and MnO2 (269 m2/g)) and pseudocapacitive behaviour. Compared with expensive RuO2, which has been used extensively as electrode material for electrochemical capacitors, the as-prepared Co3O4, NiO, V2O5, and MnO2 are much cheaper.

Management of these small remnants may be the most feasible option for the conservation of regional avian biodiversity and urban-sensitive species. Remnant native vegetation may improve the complexity of urban vegetation, or provide regular habitat or stepping-stones for dispersal in an inhospitable matrix. External factors in the surrounding matrix, or internal constraints related to the size of the remnant may influence bird communities within remnant vegetation. Determining the relative influence between these factors should assist management of conditions that will help to retain urban-sensitive species. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, bird communities in remnant vegetation were surveyed to investigate the influence of internal and external factors on composition. The effect of housing density and vegetation type was investigated in relation to remnant size. The foraging behaviour of five insectivorous species (present in low numbers) in remnants surrounded by high-density housing was examined in relation to the vegetation structure. Bird movements across habitat edges were investigated at the interface between remnant vegetation and suburban housing. The proportion of crossings by guilds and individual species were compared between edges of high- and low-density housing. Bird communities of remnant vegetation were significantly influenced by the surrounding housing density. There was no interaction between remnant size and surrounding housing density, suggesting external factors were having a greater influence than internal factors. Community composition changed in response to surrounding housing density. Introduced species, granivores and medium nectarivores occurred more often in remnants surrounded by high-density housing. These communities resembled those commonly described for the urban matrix itself. Small insectivores and nectarivores occurred more often in remnants surrounded by low-density housing, giving these communities a closer resemblance to those often described in undisturbed vegetation. It appears that remnants surrounded by low-density housing can support several bird species dependent on native habitat. The composition of bird communities in remnant vegetation was significantly influenced by vegetation type when remnants were larger than 80 ha. In remnants smaller than 35 ha bird communities were not influenced by vegetation type, suggesting they are influenced more by external factors. Bird density and species richness were influenced by vegetation structure and were positively associated with high-shrub cover. Increasing the cover of high shrubs may be one way to improve bird diversity within remnants smaller than 35 ha. Retaining larger remnants (&amp;greater than 80 ha) that provide resistance to characteristics of the surrounding suburban matrix is likely to be an important way of maintaining urban-sensitive species and bird assemblages specific to particular vegetation types, over the majority of the suburban landscape. The foraging behavior of small insectivorous birds in remnants surrounded by high-density housing was not adversely affected by urbanization. Canopy- and shrub-foragers showed minimal behavioural changes. Species classified as feeding on or near the ground tended to forage at lower heights in remnants compared with those in continuous vegetation. These changes were partially explained by structural differences between vegetation in remnants and continuous sites. The rate at which birds attacked prey items was significantly higher in continuous habitat for only two species. Overall, it appears that remnants have potential value as habitat and foraging sources in a suburban landscape. Despite this, small insectivores are still sensitive to urbanization, suggesting that other factors, probably associated with the matrix, are important. Behavioural responses to edges adjoining the two densities of housing matrix differed significantly among feeding guilds. Guilds of omnivores and nectarivores were significantly more likely than insectivores to penetrate edges adjoining high-density housing. Analysis of individual species revealed several consistent trends. Nectarivorous species appeared more likely to cross at edges of high-density housing, while insectivores were more likely to cross at edges of low-density housing. Regression models suggest these trends were influenced by characteristics within the matrix, principally the proportion of housing and shrub and canopy vegetation. Importantly, by crossing at these habitat edges many species demonstrated, that with appropriate management of the housing matrix, they have the potential for dispersal necessary for the maintenance of meta-populations. Overall this thesis suggests that characteristics of the surrounding matrix influence both the internal remnant quality and the ability of birds to disperse among remnant vegetation. Therefore management of the matrix is likely to play a pivotal role if small remnants are to function as a habitat network and promote the avian diversity of suburban landscapes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healthcare providers communication mechanisms using a case management model of care: implications for information systems development, implementation and evaluation</field><field name="creator">Hardy, Jennifer Lynette</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a fundamental problem within health care, namely communication. Major outcomes of the research include the importance of understanding the relationship between information exchange and communication and how this can impact and influence cooperation and collaboration between and among healthcare providers. The thesis has contributed to an increase in the knowledge of the integration and convergence of different theories related to; communication behaviours and patterns, information exchange, organisational change, and social systems. The application of this knowledge is to better understand the interaction among and between healthcare providers. Ultimately the end point is to bring about change that meets many needs at a multiplicity of levels or layers (across the health care arena), translating research into action that results in quality outcomes for health care consumers. There are four main components of the study that address the problem domain (communication): (i) care delivery model (Case Management Model of Care) and quality improvement; (ii) research methodology; (iii) the theoretical considerations around communication and social systems theories, and the use of, and contribution by (iv) Soft Systems Methodology plus (SSM+) to innovation and change management involving the use of information technology. The design of the research is as follows: 1. A mixed methods, mixed methodology approach framed as an action research project in a quality improvement program, and a Case Management Model of Care (CMMC) written up as a case study and carried out using SSM+. 2. The case study is used to focus on communication and information exchange issues and is reinterpreted using social systems and communication theories. Emphasis is placed on the work of Robert Craig (1999) and his reconstruction of communication theory as a dialogical-dialectical field based on the constitutive model of communication as a metamodel and theory as a metadiscursive practice. Finally the role of technology in establishing communication systems is highlighted, with particular reference to the rapidly evolving implementation of government initiatives in NSW, Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a poetics of hope: Simone Weil, Fanny Howe and Alice Walker</field><field name="creator">Howe, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to develop a poetics of hope based on the writings of Simone Weil, French mystic, philosopher and political activist. In L&#8217;Enracinement (The Need for Roots) Weil emphasizes the power of a living cultural heritage able to provide individuals with links to what she terms the &#8216;reality beyond the world&#8217;, or &#8216;absolute good&#8217;. These connections inspire a form of hope that can become a catalyst for actions characterized by love and, ultimately, play a role in the creation of more just societies. Central to this is Weil&#8217;s use of the Greek term metaxu, which describes things that act as mediators, or bridges, between the human and the divine. Certain forms of literature, according to Weil, have the potential to become metaxu. Two key themes emerge in this discussion &#8211; the significance of roots, both for the individual and his or her community &#8211; and Weil&#8217;s preference for present-oriented, rather than future-oriented hope. These themes provide the theoretical basis from which a poetics of hope begins to emerge.This poetics is then used to analyse the works of two contemporary American women writers, Fanny Howe and Alice Walker. Weil&#8217;s metaxu is able to illuminate the hope expressed in the two primary novels discussed, Howe&#8217;s Saving History and Walker&#8217;s The Color Purple. Although there are significant differences in Howe&#8217;s and Walker&#8217;s approaches to language, in the emphasis they each place on reclamation and renunciation of self, and in their conceptions of the divine, the hope expressed in both novels is revealed in acts of love that emerge as the characters focus their attention on different forms of metaxu. Integral to this discussion is the emphasis Weil, Howe and Walker place on cultivating an attitude of attentiveness towards others, towards the beauty of the world, and in the act of writing itself. Not only is this form of attention critical for the characters in Saving History and The Color Purple, the formal qualities of the texts themselves also require an attitude of attentiveness from the reader. As a result, these novels, in addition to revealing the role of metaxu in the lives of the characters, also have the potential to become metaxu in their own right. The poetics of hope developed in this thesis suggests that literature, as metaxu, has the potential to inspire a form of hope able to transform uprooted individuals and societies, and to build communities characterized by beauty, love and justice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collecting the self</field><field name="creator">Watson, Leonie</field><field name="description">This study examines the intertwining of the body and the self and the way this is represented in the visual arts. This research is informed by the bodily interventions of feminist artists and new conceptions of the self as multiple, a "locus" or meeting place of desires, beliefs, language forms and histories. This "self' is extended by technology, which dissolves boundaries of scale, of inside and outside. The paintings ask whether defined gender boundaries can be blurred, whether discrete notions of body and self can be merged, through ambiguities of inside/outside, using folds and concealments to make new kinds of bodies. This work proposes a body/self that is always in parts and in process; continually fragmenting, yet recombining to find moments of "wholeness", however transitory. The suite of paintings titled Messengers (2005 - 2006) represent some of these fleeting moments of apparent wholeness. They are complete only at the moment we see them in the light that glances across them. They represent an "incomplete" wholeness. The figures in Messengers are hybrid forms. Knotted and folded into phallic, testicular, cervical and vaginal orifices and protuberances, they present ambiguously-gendered "creatures" that merge inside and outside, self and other. These new kinds of bodies - fragmented, dispersed, reassembled - enable us to see ourselves as we feel - multiple, in flux and yet held together by a desire for unity - however momentary and contingent.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Future development trends of optical transport network infrastructure: an infrastructual framework for metropolitan-based optical transport networks - a field test of a Chinese ISP and a case study of a Chinese Electric Power Company</field><field name="creator">Chen, Sheng</field><field name="description">Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) play a foundational role in current and future telecommunication infrastructure. However, the development and implementation of OTNs have been restrained since the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Many service providers and large companies are confused in the development directions of future OTN infrastructure, as there are several standards organisations with differing positions. On the other hand, there is a lack of large scale testing, as well as practical implementation cases due to the emerging nature of the OTN. Therefore, this thesis develops a framework demonstrating a landscape of current and future development steps of OTN infrastructure from both theoretical and commercial standpoints. The key concept of the framework is the integration of the IP-oriented data transmission layer and the WDM-based optical transport layer. Traditional telecommunication infrastructure focuses on long-haul, point-to-point optical transmission with ultra broadband carrier capacity. Nevertheless, the next generation OTN systems will emphasis the delivery of IP-oriented multifunctional data services, instead of legacy simplex TDM-based services across a metropolitan span with sufficient reliability and efficiency. Thus, this thesis gives a systematic validation of the proposed framework from two angles. Firstly, it provides in-depth research on the evolution of protection technologies in metro core optical networks, along with a MPLS-based network fast recovery field test to validate the framework from the network reliability aspect. The field test was conducted using a large Chinese ISP test bed and demonstrated the practical performance of the advanced OTN protection technology from the perspective of a service provider. Secondly, this research presents a comprehensive case study based on a large commercial metro OTN upgrade project of Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC). The outcome of the case study is an evolutional roadmap, which illustrates the infrastructural development trends of this ongoing project. The roadmap can be considered as another evaluation of the framework in terms of network efficiency from an industrial-based dimension. The outcome of this research is to clarify future development trends in OTN infrastructure for the purpose of informing the design and implementation of commercial OTN applications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign exchange risk management: a description and assessment of Australian Firms' practices</field><field name="creator">Bunyamin,</field><field name="description">The extension of floating exchange-rate regimes and going change in the global nature of business are the two of the most critical factors that constitute business risk today. Australian firms engaging in international business have to manage the adverse consequences of exchange rate movements because firms may confront greater business risk that arises from, among other factors, the volatility of the Australian dollar since floating in 1983, the nature of the Australian products sold overseas, and the increase in international operations of the firm. Recent corporate crashes, indeed, demonstrate the urgency for managing foreign exchange exposure as part of providing adequate corporate governance. Against this background, this study aims to examine how Australian firms with significant foreign exchange exposure respond to such business environments. Specifically, this study is aimed at identifying and assessing the firms' practices on the management of foreign exchange exposure. This study also goes beyond a descriptive nature by investigating the potential association between firm-specific characteristic variables that may contribute to the efficacy of such practices and management practice variables. The selected firms in the study comprise large Australian firms covering major industries, both foreign and domestic owned, based in New South Wales with annual sales equal to and greater than $10 million AUD and those with significant foreign exchange exposure. Data was gathered from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). From 25,580 Australian firms compiled by the database at June 2002, 9646 firms were based in New South Wales. From this number, 299 firms were selected for sample. A mailed questionnaire was sent to the selected firms and 20.4 percent were found to be useable for analysis. The first part of analysis is essentially descriptive concerning the Australian firms' practices on foreign exchange exposure management. The description covers issues that are classified into exposure identification, policy adoption, and the techniques used in foreign exchange exposure management. Three types of foreign exchange exposures, translation, transaction, and economic exposures have been recognized by Australian firms of which transaction exposure is the most important form. Most of the surveyed firms identified that foreign sales and purchases were the major source of transaction exposure while forecasts based on 'orders' and 'cash-bycurrency' were the principle techniques used for identification. An analysis on translation exposure revealed that the majority of participating firms do not manage this exposure because it is perceived as either not real or it is primarily addressed only at headquarters. A particular analysis on economic exposure showed that many Australian firms recognized this exposure type although only few firms managed it. This indicates an increase in the awareness of this type of exposure. The analysis also described major aspects of foreign exchange exposure management policy. Most of the participating firms stated that 'the volatility of the foreign exchange of currency with which they are dealing' is the major factor driving the firms' foreign exchange exposure management. In terms of objectives, Australian firms tend to be more conservative and a passive policy is shown to be most popular. A particular analysis on forecasting policy also revealed that most firms undertake formal foreign exchange forecasts which are mostly supplied by banks in particular forms, namely, 'indication of expected direction of movement' and 'point estimate of the expected rate at given future date'. As with previous studies, it is also reaffirmed that Australian firms have a high degree of centralization. Finally, the use of internal and external techniques in this study showed that the most two popular internal techniques are 'netting' and 'a multi-currency billing system'. This study also found that there are a large number of firms that do not use any internal techniques due to insufficient information technology skills. With respect to the external techniques, forward contract is the most popular technique used. The analysis in this study is then carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the firms' practices on foreign exchange exposure management. In general, this study suggests ineffective practices found in many exposure-management elements. In terms of identification, economic exposure is the only exposure that has not been properly identified and it appears to be properly managed by only a few firms. With respect to policy adoption, most Australian firms have a conservative attitude in their foreign exchange exposure management, which is reflected in their preference for a passive policy. Implementing a passive policy, particularly for firms with transaction exposure as their major type, is ineffective because most of the surveyed firms have sufficient forecasting components and a higher degree of centralization. In terms of techniques used, it appears that forward contracts are used as an implementation of passive policy although the use of the forward contracts in this way is arguably ineffective. This is because most Australian firms have employed a sufficient forecasting policy concentrating on currencies they are dealing with in the form of either 'an indication of expected direction of movement' or 'point of estimate at a given future date'. By having this forecasting information, it is possible to save costs by adopting a more active policy. Finally, there are firm-specific factors that apparently contribute to the firms' practices on foreign exchange exposure management. Chi-squared tests for independence are used to investigate the association between firm-specific variables (firm size, the degree of foreign involvement, and ownership) and management practice variables (the adoption of either an active or passive policy, the degree of centralization and the techniques used). Although, there is no conclusive result, it appears that larger firms use more varied techniques than smaller firms because firm size implies greater resources that are available to cover the costs and potentially have a greater access to expertise. The degree of foreign involvement was found to be the only significant variable associated with the adoption of either an active or passive policy. This also suggests a more conservative attitude amongst firms. The degree of centralization is also another management practice variable found to be the only variable that has a significant association with ownership. It appears that foreign-owned firms need head office approval for foreign borrowing or lending of funds, conducting business involving foreign currencies, and entering into the foreign exchange markets for hedging purposes. Finally, there is a significant association between the degree of centralization and the adoption of either an active or passive policy. This provides a better result than previous studies that suggest an active policy when centralization is implemented. However, it has been found here that Australian firms tend to adopt a passive policy, even though a higher degree of centralization is implemented.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant rarity: species distributional patterns, population genetics, pollination biology, and seed dispersal in Persoonia (Proteaceae)</field><field name="creator">Rymer, Paul D</field><field name="description">An understanding of rarity can provide important insights into evolutionary processes, as well as valuable information for the conservation management of rare and threatened species. In this research, my main objective was to gain an understanding of the biology of rarity by investigating colonization and extinction processes from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. I have focused on the genus Persoonia (family Proteaceae), because these plants are prominent components of the Australian flora and the distributional patterns of species vary dramatically, including several that are listed as threatened. The approach I have taken was first to define the level of commonness/rarity for all species and subspecies in the genus across Australia, in order to identify potential patterns in the traits of common and rare taxa (all termed species herein). From this set of species, the subsequent research was based on two pairs (one common and one rare species in each pair) of closely related, obligate seeding Persoonia species: P. mollis subspecies nectens (common pair 1) and P. mollis subspecies maxima (rare pair 1) and P. lanceolata (common pair 2) and P. glaucescens (rare pair 2). In this research, I investigated population genetics, pollination and seed dispersal to identify consistent differences between the common and rare species in the ecological processes influencing colonization and extinction. Few robust definitions of rarity enable unambiguous comparative investigations of these processes. I defined rarity using three different methods, and classified Persoonia species into three levels of rarity (common, intermediate, rare). There was no association between rarity and either taxonomic status or geographical distribution, but several environmental (rainfall, temperature and elevation) and life-history (resprouting ability and plant size) traits differed significantly between common and rare species. These results suggest that the common species have a greater ability to persist in often harsh landscapes, being able to resprout after disturbance and tolerate severe environmental conditions. Of the taxa examined in detail, local abundance was related to distribution patterns, as the rare species tended to have fewer plants within a patch than more common species. The current distribution of Persoonia species in the Sydney region appears to reflect historical patterns rather than recent effects of fragmentation. Theory predicts that genetic variation is important for long-term persistence of populations, and that the abundance and distribution of variation is strongly dependent on genetic drift and gene flow. Small, isolated populations are therefore expected to be less diverse and more differentiated than large, inter-connected populations. Thus, rare species may be more at risk from inbreeding depression, leading to extinction. I used 389 putative AFLP loci to compare genetic variation and structuring in the two common-rare pairs of closely related species. I genotyped 15-22 adult plants, from each of the four populations, covering the geographic range of each species. Although genetic variation was low for all four species (compared to the average for long-lived outcrossing perennials), I found significantly more variation within populations of the rare species than the common species (percentage polymorphism = 61.3, 61.0 cf. 54.5, 53.2; expected heterozygosity = 0.170, 0.148 cf. 0.124, 0.128; Shannon's I = 0.239, 0.216 cf. 0.182, 0.186). My AMOVA revealed significant levels of structure both among species (21percent) and populations (15percentage), although the proportion of inter-population variation within species did not vary consistently with rarity (Pair 1 - rare 21.1 percentage cf. common 16.5 percentage; Pair 2 - rare 15.8 percentage cf. common 20.6 percentage). I detected more differentiation between populations of the rare species than the common species (controlled for the level of geographic separation), suggesting greater gene flow between populations of the common species. Even relatively small populations of rare species were more diverse than large populations of common Persoonia species. Understanding the interactions between breeding systems and pollination ecology may enable some prediction of the consequences of rarity. Using a comparative approach, I tested whether rarity is associated with aspects of reproductive biology in the two species pairs. This study focused on natural ecosystems in Australia, which have been recently affected by changes in fire regimes, especially over the past 200 years of European settlement, and by the introduction of European honeybees (Apis mellifera). In populations of the common species, more than 35% of flowers matured fruits compared to less than 20% of flowers in the rare species. All species were obligate outcrossers in each of the study populations, but only the two rare species were pollen-limited (lack of compatible pollen), with significantly lower fruit-set on open-pollinated flowers than on those cross-pollinated by hand (mean plus or equal to SE; 0.18 plus or equal to 0.02 vs. 0.42 plus or equal to 0.05; P less than 0.001). Native bees (mostly Leioproctus species) and introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera) visited flowers of all species. The native bees visited fewer flowers within a plant and moved greater distances between plants than honeybees, so the native bees are expected to be more effective in promoting outcrossing. While honeybees were the most frequent visitors to flowers of all species, native bees made more visits to the common than the rare species (number of visits/10min; 0.65 plus or equal to 0.20 vs. 0.20 plus or equal to 0.09). These results suggest that the poorer reproductive success in the rare Persoonia species was associated with lower pollinator effectiveness. If seed dispersal and seed predation influence distribution and abundance, rare species may be expected to have lower rates of seed removal and/or higher levels of seed predation than common congeners. I compared post-dispersal seed removal and seed predation in the two species pairs in two populations of each species. Population size differs between common and rare species, so I also compared seed removal and predation in both small and large populations of the common P. lanceolata. Seed removal over a four-week period by macropods was significantly greater in populations of the two common species (greater than 50% seeds/plant) than in their rare congeners (less than 25%). There was no overall effect of rarity on seed predation by rodents, but significantly more seeds of the rare P. mollis subspecies maxima were eaten than those of the other three species. There was a significant effect of rarity on seed removal. High levels of seed removal were sustained in both small and large populations of the common P. lanceolata, suggesting that population size may not be contributing to the differences between these common and rare species. Therefore, limited seed dispersal could be a potential cause of rarity in Persoonia. In this research, I identified some important similarities and differences between common and rare Persoonia species, which provide insights into the processes currently shaping their distribution and abundance. I found that the ability of plants to resprout after fire is associated with commonness/rarity, with rare species generally reliant on seeds to re-establish. Some common species are also unable to resprout, but they appear to have a greater ability to disperse pollen and seed. Rare species harbour greater levels of genetic variation within populations than common congeners. Despite these consistent differences detected between closely related common and rare species, it is difficult to distinguish whether they are causes and/or consequences of rarity. In fact, the current processes influencing the ability of plants to persist and disperse are likely to differ from those operating in historic times due to anthropogenic disturbances, including habitat fragmentation and the introduction of honeybees. While herbarium records and genetic markers give some indication that rare species are likely to have historically restricted distributions and common species appear to have rapidly colonized the landscape since the last glacial maximum, a detailed phylogeographic investigation is required to fully unravel the historic patterns. These findings have important implications for the management of rare and threatened species. Firstly, the species identified here as rare should all be assessed for risk of extinction and considered for listing under national and state legislation, as they may be susceptible to the negative effects of stochastic demographic and genetic processes. Secondly, most of the species currently listed as threatened are unable to resprout after fire, and therefore may be less persistent in the landscape and susceptible to localized extinction from frequent fire events. The ability to resprout after fire should be determined for all Persoonia I classified as rare. Thirdly, rare obligate seeders may have a reduced ability to colonize surrounding available habitat than common species, but existing populations appear to have maintained genetic variation. Therefore, all populations of rare obligate seeding Persoonia species should be of high conservation priority and efforts should focus on preserving these populations in the wild.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does emotional intelligence play an important role in leadership effectiveness?</field><field name="creator">Rosete, David</field><field name="description">Does Emotional Intelligence (EI) make someone a better leader? I utilised a cross-sectional study to examine the relationships between leadership effectiveness and tests of EI, cognitive intelligence, and personality. The study consisted of two parts. In the first study, I examined the relationship between an ability measure of emotional intelligence, the Big Five personality factors, and cognitive intelligence with leadership effectiveness. In the study, 41 executives from a large Australian Public Service organisation completed a battery of psychological tests, which included the Mayer Salovey Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT trade mark), the Sixteen Personality Factor (16PF) questionnaire, and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Leadership effectiveness was assessed using performance management ratings (i.e., participants were scored on their ability to achieve business outcomes and display effective interpersonal behaviours), and a multi-rater leadership measure scored by each leader s subordinates and their direct manager (N = 149). Correlational analyses revealed that higher emotional intelligence was associated with higher leadership effectiveness. Study II explored the link between an ability measure of EI and leadership effectiveness in more detail. This study extended that of study I by introducing a self-report EI measure and by examining the links between primary personality factors and EI. One hundred and twenty two executives from a large Australian Public Service organisation participated in the study. Executives completed a battery of measures similar to those in study one, with the addition of the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT). Participants also submitted their performance management results. The findings indicated that the executives who achieved superior business outcomes scored higher on the EI ability test. Importantly, the ability measure of EI (the MSCEIT trade mark) predicted effective leadership over and above well-established workplace measures such as reasoning ability and personality. In contrast, self-reported measures of EI (the SUEIT) had little to offer over and above these measures of personality and reasoning. In both studies, an analysis of the individual ability EI subscales revealed that the most important subscale was Perceiving Emotions. A leader who is skilled in perceiving emotion is described as someone who knows what people feel, reads people accurately, is good at recognising their own feelings and can express their feelings appropriately. These skills may be important because they allow a leader to accurately capture important social data around them. In particular, it offers the ability to quote read between the lines unquote when dealing with people. These results have important implications on how we should select and develop executives.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of conducting polymer actuators</field><field name="creator">Bahrami-Samani, Mehrdad</field><field name="description">Considerable research has been carried out to develop actuator technologies such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric actuators, magnetostrictive actuators, contractile polymers and electrostatic actuators to use in devices such as human-like robots, micro robots and artificial organs for medical applications place of conventional actuators. Though there have been great advances, one or more of high electrical power, low efficiency or low strain limit the application of these new actuator technologies. Recently, conducting polymers have drawn considerable attention as a new class of advanced functional material for many applications based on the unique properties of electro-activity, conductivity and other physical or chemical properties. The applications being considered include batteries, photovoltaic devices, electro-chromic devices, ion selective membranes, electromagnetic interference shielding, radar absorption, electrical wires, corrosion inhibitors, electrochemical sensors and actuators. For actuator applications a comprehensive electro-chemo-mechanical model is needed to predict the mechanical output (displacement or force) from the electrical input (current and voltage) to enable control engineers to use these actuators in mechanical systems, new models which describe the dynamic response (actuator output/actuator input) as a function of time and frequency are required. The research in this thesis shows how such models can be derived by exploiting standard control theory analysis tools using Laplace transforms and State-Space techniques. For conducting polymers, such a model needs to include a description of the chemical process occurring between the conducting polymer, dopant and electrolyte. Such a model will enable the application of conducting polymer actuators in automation and robotic applications in which a predictive model is needed to design the control system and also identify the system performance to optimise the actuator characteristics. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to create a comprehensive predictive model in order to track the output of a typical high- performance conducting polymer actuator: Polypyrrole Helix Tube Fibre Composite Actuator. The review of literature has revealed that previous models of polypyrrole actuators have meter, which has been assumed to be constant. In this work, it is shown that the strain to charge ratio is not always constant, particularly when a wide potential window is used. A master calibration curve approach has been devised to model the mechanical output when the strain to charge ratio is not constant. Secondly, the polypyrrole helix tubes were found to be viscoelastic, so the model was modified to include the viscoelastic (time-dependent) responses. Finally, the model was further modified to allow the viscoelastic parameters to vary with the applied potential. The latter two additions to the model greatly improve its predictive ability when the applied load is changing. To further investigate the effect of applied potential on the mechanical properties, a measurement method based on Quartz Crystal Microbalance technique has been developed. This method enables the thickness and shear modulus variation of polypyrrole thin films under electrochemical doping and un-doping (oxidation and reduction) to be studied. A complicated modulus shifting phenomenon in polypyrrole is revealed by these studies which depend strongly on the electrolyte. Finally, the results present a full description of the electromechanical characterisation of polypyrrole helix tubes considering the interacting effects of electrochemical and electromechanical parameters. This description may enable further optimization of the design and performance of polypyrrole helix tube actuators.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance and capacity of centrifugal gas cleaning devices</field><field name="creator">Saad, Mohamed S</field><field name="description">The purpose of dust control systems is to capture, collect and dispose of contaminant in an efficient manner. This research examines how to improve the operational and collection efficiency of gas cleaning devices via variations in geometry of different cyclone components. Unfortunately many of the predictive models provide inaccurate and contradictory results. Furthermore, many practical issues such as outlet and inlet configurations have not been investigated properly or at all. This study investigates the effect of cyclone outlet (vortex finder) diameter on cyclone pressure drop. Two cyclone configurations were used: air discharging directly to atmosphere; air discharging through a pipe connected to a filter. The measured values of cyclone pressure drop were compared with pressure drop predictions from various models (e.g. EEUA, 1997; Jacob et al., 1979; Rhodes, 1998; Mason et al., 1983; and Zenz, 1999). This comparison showed significant variations and differences compared with the experimental results. The models of Jacob and Dhodapkar (1979) and Mason et al. (1983) predicted similar values and were closest to the experimental data. The research evaluated existing models and developed new improved models for this purpose. A new theoretical model for pressure drop prediction across the cyclone is presented based on the consideration of the dissipative loss of flow in the cyclone system. Two different sizes of vortex finder (gas exit diameters) were used for this modeling of pressure drop. The models of Stairmand (1949), Jacob Dhodapkar (1979), Mason et al. (1983), Rhodes (1998), EEUA (1987) and Zenz (1999) predicted significantly lower pressure drops than the experimental values. The model of Barth (1956), with two values of k1 and k2 for rounded and sharp edges, respectively, predicted significantly higher values than the experimental data. Furthermore, the maximum solids flow capacity of cyclone separators was investigated. Different bulk solids and air flows were tested under different conditions: maximum solids flow rate under pneumatic conveying conditions (before choking); choked gravity flow from the test cyclone; and different gravity flow conditions from a hopper. The results obtained in this study were compared with the predictions of Beverloo et al. (1961), Brown (1961), Zenz (1962) and Johanson (1965).

This occurs as a result of the lack of depth of interaction (DOI) information which causes uncertainty in deducing the Lines of Response (LOR) between coincident events. The Centre for Medical Radiation Physics at the University of Wollongong has developed a novel detector module for use in small animal PET which will provide depth of interaction information while retaining the sensitivity of current scanners. This will result in superior imaging together with the ability to locate smaller lesions. This work focuses on preliminary investigations of the suitability of replacing the bulky scintillator crystals and photomultiplier tubes of traditional PET detector modules with compact LYSO scintillator crystals individually coupled to Si photodetectors. Preliminary simulations focused on optimising the detector module were per- formed using the GATE Monte Carlo package. Data from the simulations was processed using a newly developed sinogram binning application. This application is exible and able to adapt to numerous detector geometries based on user input. Depth of interaction information is automatically considered when binning the sino-gram.

The spatial resolution results which are provided indicate this detector module is capable of providing superior performance to monolithic scintillator crystal detector modules. Furthermore, notable advances can be made towards a significant reduc-tion of the radial elongation artefact at the edges of field of view.

However, in long-lived plants this is no easy task, due to indeterminate growth and complex stage transitions in the lifecycle and cryptic life history stages such as soil-stored seed banks. In this study, I used a combination of classical demography, experimentation and matrix transition modelling to investigate commonness and rarity in obligate seeding species from the plant genus Persoonia. I made comparisons between two closely related species pairs, Persoonia lanceolata (common) and P. glaucescens (rare), and also Persoonia mollis subsp. nectens (common) and P. mollis subsp. maxima (rare), and included a third rare species, Persoonia bargoensis. If we are to predict and mitigate the effects of changing fire regimes on obligate-seeding vegetation, we need to understand the response of seed banks to fire. I quantified the dynamics of the cryptic seed bank stage by conducting a seed burial experiment where I monitored in situ seed survival and germination in both inter- and post-fire periods. I found high levels of seed dormancy and low levels of seed mortality in the absence of fire in both common and rare species. Germination only occurred in sites that burned in late 2001, and was significantly higher in the medium intensity fire than for either the low intensity or partial-burn fires. None of these seedlings survived to October 2002, possibly as a result of well below average winter rainfall for the region. Fire effects were patchy at small scales regardless of intensity, but became more uniform across the larger site scale as intensity increased. How seed banks respond to multiple fires is also poorly understood, yet this information is important if we wish to assess the ability of obligate seeding species to persist through such disturbance regimes. I quantified the response of the single seed bank of Persoonia mollis subsp. nectens to two closely spaced fires (1997 and 2001) by comparing the magnitudes of the post-fire germination responses and by using Ripley's L function to examine differences in the spatial pattern of the seedlings in each cohort at 3.5 years post-fire. There was strong germination from the seed bank after both fires (473 and 287 individuals at 3.5 years post-fire) indicating the ability of viable seeds to persist through at least two fires, although there were significantly fewer seedlings following the second fire. The spatial pattern of germination in both seedling cohorts was significantly clustered at small scales around deceased adults, suggesting limited dispersal. The second fire also resulted in tighter clustering around deceased adults and in fewer seedlings dispersed away from adults. My results suggest that Persoonia mollis at this site has a persistent seed bank that can buffer the population against unfavourable fire frequencies and post-fire conditions, and may allow it to retain higher levels of genetic diversity in the form of seeds from previous cohorts of adult plants. Matrix transition models that allow the calculation of the population growth rate, &#65533; and identification of the vital rates most influential in directing &#65533; are a useful tool for comparing the viability of different populations and examining potential management options. I collected demographic data on survival, growth and fecundity for the five Persoonia species in 2001-02 (a normal year) and 2002-03 (a drought year) and constructed size-based transition matrices for each species in each year. In all species &#65533; was not significantly different from 1 in the normal year, indicating that populations were stable under these environmental conditions. In the drought year however, all species and sites displayed a trend of reduced &#65533; but this reduction was only significant in the rare species P. glaucescens and P. bargoensis. Elasticity analysis revealed that individuals surviving and remaining in the same size class (stasis) were having the strongest influence on &#65533; in the normal year. In the drought year, however, it was survival in the seed bank that became most important in the rare species P. glaucescens and P. bargoensis, highlighting that an understanding of seed bank dynamics is essential for management. An analysis of the way in which variation in the vital rates influenced the observed change in &#65533; in the drought year (life table response experiments) revealed that changes in stasis and growth driven primarily by increased mortality contributed most to the change in &#65533;. Comparisons between the rare and common species within each year showed that the rare species are less able to buffer the effects of drought by maintaining consistent survival. This result suggests that management to reduce mortality in the rare species during low rainfall or drought periods may be an effective conservation approach. Because fire is an important mechanism that controls the dynamics of species in fireprone habitats, it is important to have an understanding of the most appropriate fire regimes to use in management. I constructed stochastic fire models to examine the relationship between fire interval and fire frequency and how this affects extinction probabilities and population size over the next 100 years. These models chose randomly from matrices for normal and drought years, with post-fire matrices constructed to simulate the change in population dynamics in the years immediately after fire. The model for regular fire-return intervals of between 3 and 20 years showed that return intervals of less than 8-10 years resulted in extinction of all populations. I then examined the effect of different combinations of inter-fire interval typical of those reported in the literature at a frequency of 10 fires in 100 years. I found that variation in fire interval length of alternating long and short intervals produced the most optimistic outcomes for both the rare and common species. Variable fire-return intervals have also been recommended as most suitable for maintaining a range of life history types in fire prone habitats. Regular return intervals produced the most pessimistic outcomes at this frequency. Interestingly, rare species performed more poorly than their common congeners in both the regular and variable fire return intervals. This study has provided valuable new information on the threatened Persoonia species in the Sydney region. By making comparisons of common and rare species using the matrix modelling approach, I was able to highlight differences in the life histories of the common and rare species and subsequently suggest management approaches. These differences were primarily due to the fortuitous occurrence of an infrequent drought year within the study period. This reinforces the need for longer-term studies in order to document the natural levels of life history variation in perennial plant populations. I also discuss the limitations of the current study and suggest areas where further research and data collection will help to refine the current findings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Indonesian waters: the need for fisheries legislative reform</field><field name="creator">Sodik, Dikdik Mohamad</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses one of the contemporary problems facing the sustainability of world's fisheries---illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. As a result of IUU fishing, it is estimated that Indonesia loses revenue in excess of US$4 billion annually. The Indonesian Government has identified IUU fishing as a priority policy issue to be addressed. A number laws, regulations and measures have been adopted by the Indonesian Government to address IUU fishing concerns. The thesis examines how Indonesia addresses the problem of IUU fishing and how it implements international fisheries instruments. The discussion commences by providing a brief overview of the key binding and non-binding international instruments and an examination of the national legal framework to address IUU fishing. Despite the enactment of fisheries laws and regulations, there is still a gap between international fisheries instruments and Indonesia's domestic implementation of such instruments. One of the critical gaps in the effective implementation of its international fisheries obligations to combat IUU fishing is the failure of Indonesia to participate as a full member in existing regional fisheries management organizations. The continuous IUU fishing activities by Indonesian-flagged vessels in areas under the competence of RFMOs also indicates the failure of Indonesia to regulate the activities of its vessels on the high seas. The thesis also demonstrates the major challenge being faced by Indonesia with respect to its institutional framework to deal with the problems of IUU fishing. Indonesia's institutional framework is characterized by multiple institutions at the national and provincial levels, lack of coordination in fisheries-related functions, and conflicts in jurisdiction. The thesis concludes that the national legal and institutional framework is inadequate to combat IUU fishing and that such framework needs to be improved and made consistent with international fisheries instruments in order to ensure long-term conservation and management of fisheries resources.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing with Audio: The Relationship Between Music and Games</field><field name="creator">Havryliv, Mark</field><field name="description">Real time audio signal analysis opens up possibilities for interactive musical compositions where game strategy is controlled using audio signal input produced by a musician.

In such compositions, games Game design theory provides the backdrop for an examination of musical compositions based on games. In these compositions, games are referenced either by engaging the idea of game play or focusing on game structure. The same is true of electronic games that in some way relate to music.

The most common application is the use of software packages to calculate nutrient intake data obtained from dietary interviews. The development of technology to automate the interview process will allow for clinicians to spend more time focussing on patient education and counselling. The central hypothesis tested in this thesis was that automated dietary assessment would prove to be a feasible adjunct to the professional consultation in the primary healthcare setting.Development phase A series of studies were conducted examining various aspects of computer-assisted survey technology (CAST) applied to dietary advice in the primary healthcare setting. The research is presented as a case study, using action research methodology. Items in the dietary survey were developed from data reduction of food lists reported in the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey (NNS95), in conjunction with professional interpretation and judgement. The opinions and beliefs of patients from focus group interviews shaped development of the user interface and a dynamic website was developed to best allow for a diversity of eating patterns.Testing phase Video-recorded usability testing found the website to be user friendly with the time taken to complete the survey comparable to the time taken for a dietitian to interview and assess a patient&#8217;s food intake. The website was then implemented in the primary healthcare setting over a period of twelve months. Computers were set-up in fourteen medical practices in the Illawarra region of NSW, Australia. Doctors recruited patients with metabolic syndrome to use the website. Data was sent to a dietitian in the research team for development of an individualised dietary prescription, which was then sent back to the doctor to discuss with the patient.Implementation phase A cross-section of 200 patients revealed the majority of users were aged between 46 and 65 years, overweight and physically inactive. Computer ownership was identified in 80% of the users, with only 8% of patients having never used a computer previously. The computer located in the medical practice was the least preferred location of use and patients with a higher BMI were 1.9 times (p=0.04) more likely to use the computer in the home or an alternate location than at the medical practice. Reported nutrient data was highly variable. Under-reporting was observed in 46 patients (32.2%), overreporting in 31 (21.7%) of patients and 66 patients (46.2%) reported their intakes on target. No relationships were found for the reporting status of the patients and their age, BMI or gender.A repeatability study with n=38 patients revealed a learning effect which led to increased understanding of the website functions with time. Compared to a 3-day weighed food record, data from the website produced stronger correlations than a face-to-face diet history assessment. Patients using the website achieved an average 25% of their dietary goals within six weeks, despite a preference for face-to-face contact with the dietitian. Stakeholder evaluation established acceptance of the technology by dietitians, doctors and patients and provided insights into their positions within the healthcare system.Evaluation phase The research found that computerised assessment of dietary intake was a feasible addition to daily practice in the primary healthcare setting. Automating the diet history interview via the internet allowed increased patient access to dietitians whilst improving the doctors&#8217; awareness of the nutrition needs of their patients. This is especially important in the growing light of metabolic syndrome worldwide.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Looking through the twin lens of race and gender: a new politics of surveillance in Asian Australian and Asian Canadian women's writing"</field><field name="creator">Morris, Robyn</field><field name="description">&#8220;Looking Through the Twin Lens&#8221; examines how an emergent body of fiction by contemporary Asian Australian and Asian Canadian women writers engages in revisionist tactics, complicating the hierarchical nature of the politics of looking. Recent feminist theories explore the link between the male gaze, images of the female body in mass media representations and the tradition of the high art nude, but they have neglected to contextualise other forms of embodiment such as race. This study extends the theory of a gendered gaze into the area of race. Texts by Australian-based writers Simone Lazaroo, Lillian Ng and Hsu-Ming Teo and Canadian-based Hiromi Goto, Larissa Lai and Evelyn Lau, have been selected for their intercession and intervention with established ways of seeing, gazing and looking. These texts are connected not only by each writer&#8217;s Asian ancestry and their female authorship, but also by their scopic thematics and by their literary entry into contemporary individual and national identity politics. While contemporary feminist theory has prompted a re-reading of well-known texts of the West through the lens of gender, the recurring reference to well-recognised filmic or literary narratives in many of these writer&#8217;s works, allows for an interrogative return to the original through the twin lens of gender and race. In this sense, contesting the dominance of white hegemony involves both a return of the gaze and a return to issues of misrepresentation that are central to a past and contemporary cultural politics of difference.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reaction-diffusion equations for population genetics</field><field name="creator">Bradshaw-Hajek, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we reinforce the validity of using reaction-diffusion equations with cubic source terms to describe the change in frequency of alleles in a gene pool. In a population with two possible alleles at the locus in question, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation is shown to be appropriate when there is no dominance, whereas the Huxley equation is appropriate when one of the alleles is completely dominant. The difference between the Huxley equation (with cubic source term) and the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation (with quadratic source term) is explained numerically and analytically. Using the method of nonclassical symmetry analysis, we construct some practical analytic solutions to the Fitzhugh-Nagumo and Huxley equations. The solutions satisfy specific boundary conditions and are different from previously derived travelling wave solutions. We derive a system of reaction-diffusion equations describing the case of three possible alleles at the locus in question. By introducing a nonlinear transformation, we are able to construct an exact travelling wave solution. We also extend the model to include the case of spatially dependent reproductive success rates. We use classical and nonclassical symmetry methods to discover what forms of explicit spatial variability will enable us to find exact solutions to our equations. A number of solutions are constructed for various forms of spatial variability. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of systematic symmetry analysis by studying two related systems of reaction-diffusion equations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of 3D environments and potential contributions to spatial learning</field><field name="creator">Dalgarno, Barney John</field><field name="description">Three dimensional (3D) technologies have revolutionised computer games to the extent that virtually all new games are based upon 3D graphics. Some might claim that it is only a matter of time before 3D environments become the norm for other types of software, such as business systems, desktop computer task managers and online learning resources. On the surface it would appear that 3D environments have great potential in educational contexts as they provide the possibility of rich learner engagement and allow learners to explore, construct and manipulate virtual objects, structures and metaphorical representations of ideas. This thesis argues that the potentially unique contribution of such environments to learning depends on their ability to facilitate spatial learning. Specifically, it is argued that the ability of such environments to facilitate spatial learning is an implicit assumption in applications of 3D learning environments, whether they are based on models of real or metaphorical objects or spaces. In order to explore the degree to which 3D environments have unique advantages over alternatives such as video or interactive multimedia in facilitating spatial learning, it was necessary to first identify the distinguishing characteristics of 3D learning environments. The study identified seven characteristics of 3D learning environments that distinguish them from other types of multimedia learning resources. These are realistic display, smooth update of views, smooth display of object motion, consistency of object behaviour, control of view position and direction, object manipulation, and control of object model and simulation parameters. Having identified the distinguishing characteristics of 3D environments, the study explored the contribution of these characteristics to spatial learning. Investigating the contribution of all of these characteristics was considered to be outside the scope of a doctorate. Consequently, the contribution to spatial learning of smooth display of view changes, smooth display of object motion, user control of view position and direction, and object manipulation were investigated. Additionally, the study explored the effect of learning task design within a 3D environment on spatial learning. Versions of a 3D environment modelled on a chemistry laboratory were developed for use as research instruments, each with the inclusion or exclusion of some of the identified distinguishing characteristics. Participants in the study used these environments and then undertook tests to determine the degree to which they formed a spatial cognitive model of the laboratory and its apparatus. Quantitative data analysis techniques were used to compare their test performances. This allowed conclusions to be reached about the contribution of each of the identified characteristics to spatial learning. Three phases of investigation were carried out. The first, a pilot investigation, used qualitative methods to explore the usability of the virtual environment and to explore aspects of the learning that occurred through its use. In the first major investigation, three groups of participants were used. One group explored a version of the virtual laboratory with smooth view changes, smooth display of object motion, user control over view and object manipulation. A second group explored a version of the virtual laboratory without user control over view or object manipulation capability. A third group explored the real laboratory. In the second major investigation, three groups of participants were again used. One group again used a version of the virtual laboratory with all of the identified characteristics. A second group explored a version of the virtual laboratory without user control over view or object manipulation capability. A third group explored a version of the virtual laboratory without user control over view or object manipulation capability and without smooth display of view changes and smooth display of object motion. Additionally, the task carried out by the first group was varied in this second investigation in order to explore the contribution of learning task design to spatial learning. Smooth display of view changes was found to contribute to spatial learning in some but not all circumstances, and user control over view position and direction was found to contribute to spatial learning only when the task carried out in the environment was closely aligned with the desired learning. The results provided little support for the contribution of smooth display of object motion or object manipulation to spatial learning, but there were limitations in the complexity of the objects explored and the range of object manipulations carried out. The results have implications for educational designers considering the development or use of a 3D learning environment and needing to make a decision between this and alternatives such as static images and video. The advantages of such environments over video depend on the degree to which the environments allow tasks to be performed that directly align with the desired learning outcomes. If such tasks can be identified then learning advantages can occur, but only if learners are explicitly advised to undertake these tasks either through guidance provided within the environment or as part of supporting materials. The free exploration of a 3D environment with no explicit task advice is unlikely to lead to learning advantages over video or interactive multimedia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/214</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can lower limb muscles be retrained to decrease the risk of ACL injury?</field><field name="creator">Cowling, Elizabeth Jane</field><field name="description">Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee joint frequently occurs in sports that require the athlete to land or change direction suddenly. The structural integrity of this ligament during such maneuvers is heavily dependent upon coordinated quadriceps and hamstring muscle activation. Therefore, strategies used to recruit these muscles have a pivotal role in equipping the knee to withstand the high forces experienced during dynamic landing to reduce the risk of ACL injury. Despite extensive research pertaining to the ACL, no research has examined whether athletes can change the way they recruit their lower limb muscles to better protect the knee during dynamic landing. In Study 1, 24 skilled netball players performed 10 trials of a dynamic landing task, for each of four conditions: (i) normal landing (N); (ii) repeat normal landing (R); (iii) landing following an instruction to bend their knees more (K); and (iv) landing following an instruction to turn their hamstring muscles on earlier and more before foot-ground contact (M). During each trial the sagittal plane motion, ground reaction forces, and muscle activity for rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), semimembranosus (SM), and biceps femoris (BF) of the landing limb were recorded. Results showed that simply asking players to bend their knees more on landing (K condition) was somewhat effective in increasing knee flexion. However, players were unable to selectively recruit their hamstring muscles upon request during this abrupt landing task. It was concluded that more extensive muscle training was required to alter the subjects hamstring-quadriceps muscle recruitment patterns during landing. Therefore, the purpose of Study 2 was to assess the efficacy of an electromyographic biofeedback retraining program to alter hamstring muscle recruitment during landing. For Study 2, 28 netball players performed the same landing action as described in Study 1 for 10 trials before (PRE) and after (POST) a 6-week interval in which the 14 experimental athletes completed hamstring biofeedback training for three 30-minute sessions per week, while the control subjects maintained their normal playing routines. Results confirmed that the biofeedback training was ineffective in training the subjects to significantly alter the timing of their hamstring muscles. Further a priori analysis of the data using single-subject design (Study 3) revealed that, although individuals displayed a variety of changes in muscle recruitment patterns that were masked when only examining the experimental group mean data, the biofeedback program was still not successful in achieving earlier hamstring muscle recruitment. In conclusion, it is still unknown how to best train individuals to equip them to perform dynamic landings without sustaining ACL ruptures. Further research is required to elucidate benefits of verbal instructions in landing training, to understand whether electromyographic biofeedback training can be used to train muscle recruitment patterns during dynamic landings, and to ascertain whether combining group mean data and single-subject analysis gives a more complete picture of how a group of individuals responds to a training intervention. With further research attention, it is anticipated that the risk of ACL rupture may be reduced.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labourism and the commodification of work and social life</field><field name="creator">Humphries, David</field><field name="description">The thesis explores concepts of alienation and commodification in relation to public and private themes of identity, in contemporary Australia. It is argued that as labour conditions have intensified and the social safety net has eroded the emphasis on private themes of identity have increased. These themes emphasise sexuality and gender, and down-grade the issue of work and labour. The Australian Labor Party helped create the conditions for postmodernist identity politics weakening their commitment to working class improvement in favour of emphasising hypercapitalism and hyperliberal gender discourses. This approach favours the inclusion of marginal groups that have been traditionally outside of labourist concerns (women, homosexuals, Aborigines) at the expense of civilising capitalism, labour alienation and commodification as the central concern for workers. In short, the abandonment of Marxism, labourism and Social democracy: and their replacement by identity issues. The backlash to a post-welfare state social democracy designed to ameliorate conditions for marginal groups, become a key feature in the election of the Howard government in 1996, with Howards battlers consisting of former Labor voters disenfranchised by political correctness. This produced an attack on welfare cheats, high taxation, and trendy concerns such as Aboriginality &#65533; and reinforced Hansonism. In this context, the Australian and American relationship and the frontier tradition is stressed as a pivotal factor in determining the role of identity in the neo-liberal political economy, with the pressures created by neo-liberalism and globalisation. Australian mythology based on Anzac symbolism and personality creates a vacuous phenomenon for genuine themes of Australian national identity to survive the homogenous nature of hyper-capitalism. The drift towards the power of American capitalism and political cosmologies can then been seen as a natural evolution of Australian political mythology. It is here that the thesis argues that hyper capitalist themes can have an implicit relationship to concepts of hyper-liberalism found in gender discourses and moreover, ironically evocative of the individualism Weber argued existed in American Protestant religious sects. Subsequently the de-construction of masculinity that has been characteristic of feminist and gay theory, that reflects a social psychological perspective rather than one based in Marxs historical materialism that places man within social history. Social theory therefore unfairly constructs the heterosexual masculine personality in relation to working class elite occupations such as coalmining or as a reflection of a corporate dominance, to create polemic avenues for marginal groups. The focus upon heterosexuality within the thesis links its relationship to the characteristics demanded by industrial capitalism such as the Fordist mode of production, and in Marxist terms, the complete enslavement and alienation that existed between social man and the capitalist mode of production. This approach emphasises the experience of wage labour, culminating with the high levels of unemployment that has risen concomitantly with de-industrialisation, globalisation and neo-liberalism. The disciplining of the unemployed in the post-welfare state exists alongside hyper-liberal themes of sexual and social identity, indicating a general shift to a social fascism, or two- tiered form of democracy that resides alongside, and is often in competition with conservative advocates for the nuclear family and heterosexuality. The development of Howards battlers reflects a conservative appropriation of the original Australian legend that was based on labourism and mateship and now exists in a nationalist paradigm evocative of frontiersmen and Anzacs rather than one based on class. A framing issue for the thesis subsequently is what role does gender and sexuality have in the function of the industrial capitalist society?</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Martensitic transformations and shape memory alloys.

The focus is on the period from the formation of the Australian Journalists' Association (AJA) in 1910, to the start in 1987 of the transformation of Colleges of Advanced Education (CABs) into universities. However, significant moments in the development of journalism education and training prior to 1910 are also included, such as the first journalism lecture at Leipzig University in 1672. Also, developments in three other English-speaking countries -- America, Britain, and New Zealand -- are traced up to 1987 for comparison with the Australian experience. It is risky to describe anything as 'unique', yet it appears that Australia has developed a form of journalism training and education that is unique. It would be convenient to describe what happens in Australia as an unique 'system', but this would be inaccurate. One of the differences between Australia and most other developed nations is that by 1987 it has no uniform system. For instance, on-the-job training schemes are now rare and approaching extinction. Where they do exist they tend to lack structure and are far from comprehensive. Tertiary education institutions are taking responsibility for journalism training as well as journalism education. But the differences among the courses offered by 11 institutions in 1987 are so significant that as well as there being no uniform on-the-job training 'system' there is no typical journalism education 'system' in Australia. The fundamental cause of this shambolic state is that the initiator of most of both the on-the-job training schemes and the journalism education courses has been a trade union, the Australian Journalists' Association (AJA). This organisation's industrial priorities have often been in conflict with some of the processes necessary to realise the aspirations of many of its members for journalism to be a profession. Furthermore, although most journalists are members of the AJA, the union is too IV small to be able to monitor even the metropolitan-based training and education schemes. Hence, employers and tertiary institutions have been able to follow their own goals, which more often than not are very different from each other, and seldom coincide with those of the AJA.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The compositions of Brett M.

There are many writers who have stated that we must only perform music of the highest quality in the service of the church, but very few have tackled the issue of how this is to be achieved. This thesis will examine a number of different ways to look at quality in church music: by examining the musical standard and theological soundness of the work, by looking at the pastoral and liturgical appropriateness of the work, and at the intent of the author and composer. This thesis then seeks to create a methodology for examining quality in church music; mindful of the fact that our judgement is often clouded by our likes and dislikes, and that our opinions are often disguised in terms of appropriateness for worship. While there is some debate of the validity of doing so, composers are pushing the envelope as to style and technique in the composition of new works of church music. This thesis will look at the difference between music for congregation and that for specialist musicians, and how differences in expectations and use lead to differences in qualitative judgement.

This was achieved through: (a) a comparison of inhibition in the typical (simple) stop-signal task with other forms of inhibition, (b) a within-subject manipulation of stop-signal probability, and (c) an examination of response inhibition in populations characterised by impulsivity. Furthermore, throughout this thesis, event-related potentials (ERPs) were examined to provide an insight into the electrophysiological nature of response inhibition. Therefore, a secondary aim of this thesis was to further elucidate the functional significance of inhibition-related ERPs. The comparison of the simple stop-signal and go/nogo tasks revealed that inhibition manifests more centrally when an ongoing response is inhibited successfully, relative to the frontal distribution of inhibition when a response is merely in preparational stages, reflecting the differential sites of inhibitory control acting on response processing between the two tasks. However, when the stop-signal inhibitory response was manipulated by including an additional stimulus discrimination, creating a stop/no-stop (selective) form of inhibitory control, the latency of the inhibitory response and the manner in which responses were inhibited remained unaffected. Thus, inhibiting an ongoing response, whether it be in a simple or selective context, was associated with a fast, centrally-located inhibitory action. The electrophysiological index of this &#65533;urgent&#65533; stop-signal inhibition process was found to be reflected in the P3 component on successful stop trials, while the small auditory N2 was believed to be associated with a frontally-located, deliberate form of response selection or control, a process which may be by-passed by subjects when a more urgent form of inhibitory control is required. The N2 and P3 for failed stop trials, however, were shown to be overlapped by response-related components reflecting erroneous processing. The manipulation of stimulus probabilities revealed that larger ERP component amplitudes for rare stop-signals may not necessarily reflect greater inhibitory activation compared to frequent stop-signals, but rather may reflect stimulus probability &#65533;oddball&#65533; effects. In the final phase of this thesis, an examination of response inhibition in impulsive populations revealed that non-clinical adults who showed high degrees of the impulsiveness personality trait did not suffer from an inhibitory deficit, but rather, were characterised by an over-active response process. In contrast, adults with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, despite similar overt performance with non-clinical groups, showed a slower and under-active inhibition process that was compensated for through a reduction of response activation. These findings suggest that a deficiency in the stop-signal inhibition process is not associated with impulsive behaviours in general, but with a more clinical form of impulsivity. Together the findings from this thesis have presented an electrophysiological view of response inhibition in the stop-signal task that has: (a) furthered our understanding of the manifestation of inhibition in different inhibitory contexts and populations, (b) clarified the functional significance of the N2 and P3 components in the stop-signal task, and (c) provided an insight into the relationship between stop-signal inhibition and impulsivity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The technological trajectory of the automatic identification industry: the application of the systems of innovation (SI) framework for the characterisation and prediction of the auto-ID industry</field><field name="creator">Michael, Katina</field><field name="description">Traditionally the approach used to analyse technological innovation focused on the application of the techno-economic paradigm with the production function as its foundation. This thesis explores the rise of the evolutionary paradigm as a more suitable conceptual approach to investigating complex innovations like automatic identification (auto-ID) devices. Collecting and analysing data for five auto-ID case studies, (bar codes, magnetic-stripe cards, smart cards, biometrics and RF/ID transponders), it became evident that a process of migration, integration and convergence is happening within the auto-ID technology system (TS). The evolution of auto-ID is characterised by a new cluster of innovations, primarily emerging through the recombination of existing knowledge. Using the systems of innovation (SI) framework this study explores the dynamics of auto-ID innovation, including organisational, institutional, economic, regulatory, social and technical dimensions. The results indicate that for a given auto-ID innovation to be successful there must be interaction between the various stakeholders within each dimension. The findings also suggest, that the popular idea that several technologies are superseded by one dominant technology in a given selection environment, does not hold true in the auto-ID industry. Each device studied has a significant role to fulfil in the marketplace, sharing in the same technological trajectory. Trends captured from the embedded case studies provide evidence for the continued growth in the requirement for auto-ID; they also point to an ever-increasing pervasiveness in auto-ID exemplified in the quest for the human electrophorus. Finally, as new auto-ID innovations are introduced, it is important to ensure that the adequate safeguards are put in place to protect citizens against accidental or intentional misuse. This is especially true of wireless applications that make use of wearable computing and microchip implants for tracking and monitoring purposes. Engineers therefore, should act in a socially responsible manner when inventing or patenting, viewing ethical discourse as an integral component of the innovation process, despite the competitive pressures for stakeholders to be first-to-market with new solutions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing synergetic momentum: a grounded theory of the management of public-private partnerships</field><field name="creator">Noble, Gary Ian</field><field name="description">This study uses an orthodox grounded theory methodology to discover the main professional concerns of managers responsible for the establishment and maintenance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) involving local governments and private sector firms. In addition, this study explains the social processes that these managers use to resolve these concerns over the life of a PPP project. Orthodox grounded theory is an inductive research methodology capable of theory building. It was selected for use for several reasons. These included its ability to provide an explanation of the variation in the patterns of behaviour of respondents as they establish and manage a PPP project. Data was collected from ten PPP projects in both Australia and the UK through interviews with forty three respondents, non-participant observation and archival records. Data was analysed using the constant comparative method and involved the use of theoretical memos and theoretical sampling procedures. The main professional concern of respondents over the managerial life of a PPP project involves the need to maintain the forward momentum of a project whilst also having to constantly resolve managerial issues through a process of seeking the cooperation of managers from the partner organisation. Key managers continuously resolve this concern through the social process of &#8216;managing synergetic momentum&#8217; (MSM). The grounded theory of MSM suggests that in circumstances where there exists strong emotional bonds, mutual trust and respect, key managers are likely to make a conscious decision to manage a PPP project through largely informal methods that often rely on the use of psychological contracts between individuals. In contrast, when there are low levels of emotional bonding between key managers, the style of management chosen by managers is often formal and bureaucratic in nature. This management style often involves the use of committee and other formal decision making processes to resolve managerial issues. An informal management style can be an effective means to address the issues of maintaining forward momentum of a PPP and managing in a cooperative manner with other key managers. This study contributes to the extant literature in several ways. Firstly, it provides insights into, and an explanation of, the actions of key managers in the process of managing PPP projects. It provides another dimension in the PPP literature to the micromanagement of PPPs. Secondly, it provides conceptual support to many of the themes contained in the cooperative inter-organisational relationship (CIOR) literature by contextualising the dynamics of the social processes that underlie these themes. The grounded theory of MSM is also significant in that it provides practitioners in the substantive area of inquiry with a number of recommendations designed to assist in their control over the management of a PPP project. In addition, the grounded theory of MSM identifies a number of avenues for future research that may add further to our understanding of the management of PPPs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory, music and displacement in the minor memoirs of Evelyn Crawford, Ruby Langford Ginibi and Lily Brett</field><field name="creator">Breyley, Gay Jennifer</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates some legacies of colonialism and genocide through a reading of Evelyn Crawford's transcribed oral history Over My Tracks (Melbourne, 1993), Ruby Langford Ginibi's life narrative Don't Take Your Love To Town (Melbourne, 1988) and Lily Brett's memory-based volumes of poetry After The War (Melbourne, 1990) and Unintended Consequences (Sydney, 1992). These texts, for different but related reasons, constitute minor Australian memoirs. The thesis argues that new readings of such memoirs contribute to new understandings of the intersectional nature of cultural histories. The reading presented in this thesis is structured theoretically and thematically by a focus on memory, music and displacement. Using a theoretical framework based more closely on aural than on visual models, this reading brings the three narrating subjects into conversation and attends to their respective representations of ancestral legacies, childhood, adolescence and adulthood. With methods drawn from literary criticism, ethnomusicology and history, the thesis offers a new way of listening to the complex memories of displaced people and their descendants. It is a study of diverse, ongoing effects of past persecution in the everyday lives of survivors and descendants, an area that has received limited attention in Australian literary studies. The thesis contributes to knowledge of the far-reaching consequences of different forms of displacement and points to implications for the current and future reception of displaced people's memories in Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interleaved spread spectrum orthogonal frequency division multiplexing for system coexistence</field><field name="creator">Tu, Pingzhou</field><field name="description">Various kinds of wireless communication devices and systems provide a number of different functions and services to meet different demands for people. Some of these devices and systems coexist in the same area and share the common frequency bands according to some coexistence mechanisms such as cooperative and non-cooperative mechanisms. These mechanisms including power control, frequency hopping and time division multiplexing technique can handle electromagnetic interference between coexistence devices to some extent, but for the coexistence systems the interference problems between these systems are still very serious issues which affect coexistence system performance. In this thesis we consider the system coexistence interference problems in the spectrum shared environments. Rather than applying the techniques of power control, frequency control, time control and spatial control to avoid interference, we attempt to address the fundamental nature of system transmission. The general philosophy is to combine the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique with a spectrum spread method to generate an interleaved spectrum spread OFDM (ISS-OFDM) multiple subband signal, so that the system transmission subbands are selected adaptively and system coexistence interference is avoided and suppressed. This approach reveals the potential ability of system coexistence. Simulated results on system performance such as peak to average power ratio (PAR), signal frequency diversity and time diversity, and system bit error rate (BER) are presented to verify that system transmission bandwidth can be adaptively selected to avoid interference of coexistence systems and improve system performance. We then consider the implications of choosing or dropping the subbands with different levels of interference from the multiple subbands of the ISS-OFDM signal, and show that (i) it is possible to implement the information transmission without information loss by selecting some of the subbands with an interference level below the threshold, and dropping the subbands with an interference level over the threshold, and (ii) it is possible to derive the interference thresholds, based on which the adaptive selection subband transmission is implemented. We also show that it is possible to replace the interference thresholds over multipath fading channels by the interference thresholds over the Gaussian channels, so that the derivation process of interference thresholds over the multipath fading channels is greatly simplified. Through the theoretical analysis and investigations, we show that the ISS-OFDM technique can be applied to the coexisting systems sharing the frequency bands in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band. Coupled with a technique for cognitive radios, the ISS-OFDM can be applied to a wide class of problems covering the interference suppression and spectrum efficiency improvement.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomy of a disaster: the IMF's war on corruption in Indonesia and the effects of structural adjustment</field><field name="creator">Lysaght, Georgia</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the advice given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Indonesia, during and after the Asian crisis and the impact that this had on corruption and subsequently Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It argues that the key mistake made by the IMF was the assumption that foreign business is averse to corruption and state involvement in economic development. This assumption relied on a key tenet of neo-liberalism &#8212; that the only state intervention in the economy should be to ensure the primacy of the so-called free market. While the aim of the IMF&#8217;s Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in Indonesia was to stem the crisis and facilitate economic recovery, Indonesia&#8217;s economic, social and political situation continued to deteriorate after the implementation of the IMF 'reforms'. The thesis argues that the Indonesian experience provides a number of lessons for developing economies, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), and the neo-liberal project generally. Specifically these are that corruption can operate in a functional or dysfunctional manner depending upon the political and economic environment in which it exists; that democratisation processes within a state cannot be achieved quickly simply by altering its political structure; that developing states have a valid role in regulating investment and the economy for the purpose of economic development; that the state can play a role in preventing or at least reducing the impact of a major financial crisis; that neither national economies nor the international financial system are insulated from vested interests; that FDI privileges economic certainty and profit over issues of economic regulation and corruption; and that the so-called free market system is dependent upon state intervention to prevent collapse.  In Indonesia's case, while the IMF program sought to reduce the high level of corruption by diffusing politico-business power and dismantling the country&#8217;s authoritarian system of government, the measures succeeded only in fragmenting corruption so that any previously existing checks and balances were abolished. Instead of improving the situation with respect to FDI, these measures resulted in intolerable levels of economic and business uncertainty for foreign investors. Indonesia was no longer considered an attractive place for business to invest as the country became too economically and politically volatile. In fact, while other crisis-affected countries had begun to recover by 1999, Indonesia&#8217;s economic situation remained volatile until 2005, when its political situation stabilised.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pound foolish - accounting's role in deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="creator">Smark, Ciorstan</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine two accounting questions. The first one was whether accounting had played a role in encouraging the shifting of costs between the government (particularly the State Government of New South Wales) and the following groups of people: People with mental illness Carers of people with mental illness Government institutions for health, jails, welfare and housing Non-government charitable institutions The answer to this question was found to be that accounting had indeed played a role in the shifting of costs in this area. It had also played a role in making certain costs appear to be real and in causing other costs to disappear from view. The Monetary and Entity assumptions of accounting are particularly relevant here. The second question explored in this thesis was, could accounting be used (acknowledging difficulties with quantification and identification of costs) as an analysis tool in the context of mental health in examining the issue of whether deinstitutionalisation from mental hospitals actually reduced costs. Or did it merely shift costs from one budget (government) to a wider budget (society)? The answer to this question was less clear cut. From a societal perspective, it seems that the costs of deciding to deinstitutionalise people from mental hospitals in the irresponsible and heartless way that it was done in New South Wales imposed vast and unfair burdens on the classes of people enumerated above. Whether the societal costs are the correct ones to be considered was found to be open to debate as was the potential usefulness of accounting in answering such questions. Rationalist motivations were found to be overwhelmingly dominant when it came to the decision to pursue deinstitutionalisation as little more than dumping; but the rhetoric to go with the decisions was glibly humanitarian. From a narrow, accounting perspective, deinstitutionalisation was pursued in a very satisfactory manner. From the perspective of those most affected by the policy, and from an ethical viewpoint, deinstitutionalisation is argued to have had disastrous consequences for some of its consumers and to have been immoral. What are the consequences of this sort of public policy analysis? In the case of welfare providing social harmony through encouraging the people's allegiance to the state, the niggardly treatment of people with mental illness is perhaps a cause for concern. True, people with mental illness and their carers are a wise choice as targets for bad treatment - being amongst the most voiceless and powerless members of the community. Where the state is endangering the social harmony aspect of welfare is that the penny wise, pound foolish treatment of people with mental illness seems to extend to a broader realm of government policy than just deinstitutionalisation. Society in general may risk alienation and unrest if the sort of narrow, unethical, accounting-based, economic rationalist decision making, so evident in deinstitutionalisation, spreads widely throughout areas of public policy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Removal of emerging trace organic contaminants by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis</field><field name="creator">Nghiem, Long Duc</field><field name="description">This study investigates the retention mechanisms of three prominent classes of emerging trace organic contaminants . natural steroid hormones, hormone mimicking compounds, and pharmaceutically active compounds . by several nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis membranes. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out using both cross flow and dead end stirred cell filtration equipment with the goal of relating trace organic retention behaviour to membrane characteristics, physicochemical properties of the trace organic molecules, and solution chemistry. The results reported here show that retention of neutral trace organics by a tight NF or RO membrane is dominated by steric (size) exclusion, whereas both electrostatic repulsion and steric exclusion govern the retention of negatively charged trace organics by a loose NF membrane. In the latter case, speciation of trace organics may lead to a dramatic change in retention as a function of pH, with much greater retention observed for ionized, negatively charged trace organics. Retention of the negatively charged trace organics decreases as the solution's ionic strength increases due to charge shielding and double layer compression. For uncharged trace organic species, intrinsic physicochemical properties of the trace organic molecules can substantially affect their retention. In their neutral form, natural steroid hormones, hormone mimicking compounds, and pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen adsorb considerably to the membrane because of their relatively high hydrophobicity. Similarly, polarity (represented by the dipole moment) can influence the separation of molecules that are cylindrical in shape as they can be directed to approach the membrane pores head on due to attractive interaction between the molecule polar centers and fixed charged groups on the membrane surface. This phenomenon is probably inherent for high dipole moment organic compounds and the governing retention mechanism remains steric in nature. The adsorption of trace organics to the membrane polymer has several important implications. Firstly, because the adsorptive capacity of the membrane is limited, the final retention stabilizes when the adsorption of trace organics into the membrane polymer has reached equilibrium. At this later filtration stage, the overall hormone retention is lower than what expected based on solely size exclusion mechanism. This behaviour is attributed to partitioning and subsequent diffusion of hormone molecules in the membrane polymeric phase, which ultimately results in a lower retention. Trace organic diffusion in the membrane polymeric matrix most likely depends on the size of the molecule, hydrogen bonding of the compound to membrane functional groups, and hydrophobic interactions of the compound with the membrane polymeric matrix. Secondly, the membrane can serve as a large reservoir for trace organics and their release may be possible during membrane cleaning or erratic pH variation during operation. Treatment of membrane cleaning solution should be carefully considered when such trace organics are amongst the target contaminants in NF/RO membrane filtration. The study also critically demonstrates the possible complexity of a real membrane filtration system where trace organic contaminants are of concern. Several factors including operating conditions, the solution chemistry, and other constituents such as organic and particulate matter that may be present in the feed solution can influence the filtration of trace organics. Findings in this study are crucial in understanding the removal mechanisms and filtration processes of trace organic contaminants. However, the application of such findings to a practical situation requires a careful consideration of these factors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extreme dude! A phenomenological perspective on the extreme sport experience</field><field name="creator">Brymer, George Eric</field><field name="description">The phrase 'extreme sport' has been adopted as an umbrella term to signify everything from youth sports to lifestyle sports, from skateboarding to big wave surfing. Inevitably this broad definition has created a confusing array of seemingly dissimilar research findings. This study revisits the extreme sport definition to include only those activities where a mismanaged mistake or accident would most likely result in death, as opposed to injury. A broad hermeneutic phenomenological approach has been embraced to reveal findings that critique the assumed relationship to risk-taking, the death wish and the concept of 'No Fear' and reposition the experience in a hitherto unexplored manner. Data sources include direct interviews with male and female participants over 30 years of age and other first and third hand accounts. Participants report deep inner transformations that influence world views and meaningfulness, feelings of coming home and authentic integration as well as a freedom beyond the socio-cultural that is best described as a relaxation from mental chatter. Excitingly participants also describe moments of ineffability that include enhanced sensory, mental and physical prowess, perceptions of time slowing, returning to a primal state, feelings of floating and flying and a deep intimacy with the natural world. Phenomenologically, these experiences have been interpreted as transcendence of time, other, space and body. The implication of these findings is that the young, male, thrill-seeking, adrenaline junky stereotype is exposed as an over simplification. Instead extreme sport participation points to a more potent, life-enhancing endeavour worthy of further investigation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geomorphology of the Minnamurra River estuary, southeastern Australia: evolution and management of a barrier estuary</field><field name="creator">Panayotou, Kate</field><field name="description">The Minnamurra River estuary, located on the southeastern coast of Australia, provides an opportunity to examine the sedimentary records of the stages of infill of a barrier estuary through to maturity. By describing and interpreting the diverse geomorphological and stratigraphic units of Minnamurra River estuary and comparing the long-term Holocene morphodynamic evolution with the short-term engineering time scale changes, the nature of Holocene estuary evolution in a bedrock confined valley in a microtidal environment is investigated, providing an evolutionary context for contemporary estuary changes. Management concerns for the Minnamurra River estuary are also investigated, in particular the study includes examination of estuary sediment geochemistry and patterns of recent sedimentation and erosion.The Minnamurra River estuary is characterised by three main depositional environments: the marine depositional environment including the marine flood-tide delta and sand barrier, the estuarine depositional environment incorporating the central mud basin, and the fluvial-dominated environment including the fluvial delta, riverine channel and the alluvial plain. During the final stages of the postglacial marine transgression, the Minnamurra River estuary became a sediment sink that has been largely infilled by marine and fluvial sediments. Examination and quantification of past and present patterns and rates of sedimentation has been assessed through a detailed stratigraphy constructed from 42 auger drill holes, supplemented by full core drill holes, shorter PVC cores from recent depositional environments and surface sediment sampling. A detailed chronology of the infilling of the barrier estuary was also established using radiocarbon dating and 210Pb analysis.210Pb was used to examine sediment deposition at four sites in the Minnamurra River estuary. Cores were collected from two cut-off embayments, the edge of the main channel and from a tributary off the main channel, Rocklow Creek. Average sedimentation rates ranged from 0.3 - 0.8 cm/year and provided 52 - 148 years of sedimentation history. These results provide a means of comparing infilling rates throughout the Holocene evolution of a mature barrier estuary. In particular, they have afforded the opportunity to quantify the amount of sediment that bypasses the estuary, which is now in a mature form. The reduced accommodation space of a river-dominated estuary means that the amount of sediment which used to be deposited in the extensive central mud basin that acted as a sediment sink, must now be deposited elsewhere. In the Minnamurra River estuary a small percentage of the sediment is deposited in the remaining cut-off embayments or in overbank deposition during time of high flow. The remaining sediment, calculated to be approximately 90% of the total sediment supplied to the Minnamurra River estuary, bypasses the system and is deposited in the nearshore.Recent trace metal levels recorded in the surface sediment samples and short cores show there was little change in the levels of trace metals measured in the sediment. Most trace metal results were below the ISQG-Low trigger value, however there were a few exceptions. Arsenic, copper and nickel levels of several sediment surface samples were between the ISQG-Low and ISQG-High ANZECC (2000) sediment quality guideline values. Only copper levels exceeded the ISQG-High ANZECC sediment quality guidelines in a few sediment samples.Although geomorphological evolution of wave-dominated estuaries is relatively well known, the understanding of wave-dominated estuaries that have reached a river-dominated stage is less well known and as a result, has been investigated in this thesis. This research has described and interpreted the Holocene transformation of the estuarine ecosystem of the Minnamurra River estuary from a wave dominated system 8500 years BP to the present river-dominated system with its restricted estuarine habitats and geomorphology. A five-stage evolutionary model has been devised for the Minnamurra River estuary depicting the changes of infill that occurred during the Holocene. During the first stage of Holocene evolution, 8500 - 6500 years BP, the Minnamurra River valley was inundated by rising sealevel. Initial marine deposition occurred semi-enclosing the valley, forming a central mud basin. The rate of infill increased substantially in stage two (6500 - 4500 years BP) when barrier progradation further enclosed the central mud basin. During stage three (4500 - 2500 years BP) extensive infilling led to continued barrier progradation and further infill of the central mud basin by fluvial deposits, which also may have resulted in a number of cut-off embayments forming. In the fourth stage of estuary infill, the central mud basin was largely filled and characterised by an extensive swamp. During this stage the estuary progressed towards becoming river-dominated with a confined channel, extensive floodplain and an increase in intertidal environments. The fluvial channel form meandered through the floodplain and the sand barrier sequence. The last 100 years encompasses the fifth stage of the evolutionary model for the Minnamurra River estuary in which the estuary was impacted by anthropogenic influences. During this stage the swampy floodplain was drained and the meandering channel in the fluvial and estuarine depositional environments was straightened. Accommodation space during the final stage of the model is significantly reduced with only a few cut-off embayments remaining. The results provided a chronology of the deposition of transgressive deposits, barrier progradation, central mud basin development and subsequent fluvial expansion. They also provided the opportunity to calculate volume of Holocene estuary infill. Approximately 98,000,000 m3 of sediment was deposited during the Holocene.The framework of geomorphology and management adopted in this study can be applied to other estuaries. The future success of estuary management requires a combined effort to integrate management in a comprehensive sense by linking geological, biological and chemical aspects with social and economic factors, framed within the context of the longer-term estuary evolution and recent estuary changes. The evolution of the Minnamurra River estuary has undergone five geomorphologically distinct phases associated with rising and later falling sea-level, estuary confinement from barrier development, fluvial delta progradation and anthropogenic influence by draining the floodplain and channel straightening. Sedimentation rates differed in these five geomorphologically distinct phases. The model of estuary evolution proposed in this thesis endeavours to synthesise divergent hypotheses in the literature with three key features. These three key features are firstly hydrodynamics that combines the three processes (waves, tides and river); secondly, geomorphology, which is shaped by the three processes; and thirdly percentage infill that is controlled by the balance between accommodation space and sediment supply.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to image encryption and authentication</field><field name="creator">Uehara, Takeyuki</field><field name="description">Advanced digital technologies have made multimedia data widely available. As multimedia applications become common in practice, security of multimedia data has become main concern. Digital images are widely used in various applications, that include military, legal and medical systems and these applications need to control access to images and provide the means to verify integrity of images.Image encryption algorithms protect data against unauthorized access. In almost all cases image data is compressed before it is stored or transmitted because of the enormity of multimedia data and their high level of redundancy. Compressing plaintext before applying the encryption algorithm effectively increases security of the overall system. However direct application of encryption algorithms to image data i) requires high computational power and ii) introduces delay in real-time communication. If a data compression algorithm can be made to also provide security, less processing overhead could be expected as a single algorithm achieves two goals.Image authentication provides the means to verify the genuineness of images.       Authentication codes provide a method of ensuring integrity of data. The challenge in image authentication is that in many cases images need to be compressed and so the authentication algorithms need to be compression tolerant. Cryptographic authentication systems are sensitive to bit changes and so are not suitable for image authentication.In this thesis, we study existing image encryption and authentication systems and demonstrate various attacks against these systems. We propose a JPEG encryption system that encrypts only part of the data, and a JPEG2000 encryption system that uses a simple operation, i.e. permutation, and show methods to minimize the computation cost for encryption. We also propose an image authentication system that remains tolerant to changes due to JPEG lossy compression.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/430</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of teaching portfolios by secondary school teachers in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Chorrojprasert,, Linchong</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of portfolios as a part of the mandated quality assurance requirements by teachers in secondary schools in Thailand and their impact on the teachers&#65533; beliefs about their practices in teaching and learning. The study was guided by the following questions: 1. In what ways do the teachers use and develop their portfolios? 2. How do the teachers perceive the use of portfolios? 3. What is the impact of the portfolio development process on the teachers' beliefs about their practices in relation to teaching and learning? A mixed research method was employed to answer these questions. As a result of two pilot studies, a survey was conducted in ten public secondary schools in nine educational service areas in the Central District of Thailand (Bangkok). The sample size of the study was 485 teachers, recruited according to a purposeful sampling technique on a voluntary basis with the condition that they must have at least completed their first teaching portfolios by the academic year 2002. To complement the survey, qualitative methods, which included in-depth interviews and portfolio analysis, were conducted with a group of 9 teachers from 3 schools with either high, moderate and low average scores on perceptions of portfolios as tools and portfolio impacts. After the interviews, their teaching portfolios were analyzed as evidence of their beliefs about their practices in relation to teaching and learning. Responses from the survey, interviews and review of documents were analyzed and processed and the results were presented in both quantitative and qualitative forms which include tables of statistical analysis results, narrative and descriptive texts and quotations. Findings from the study revealed that the majority of participants developed their portfolios to fulfill the quality assurance requirements by the Ministry of Education and the performance assessment requirements of their schools. Though the portfolio formats varied, the contents of most portfolio included personal data and work-related documents. In regards to their portfolio construction process, most participants agreed that the over loadings of work and additional responsibilities were major constraints, and collaboration among peers was the most helpful factor. Clear guidelines and instructions from the schools would help them to create better portfolios. Approximately 55% of the participants agreed that they expected to learn about and improve their teaching from their portfolio experiences and approximately 45% agreed that teaching portfolios are appropriate tools for teachers' professional development and performance assessment. About half of the participants agreed that developing portfolios helped them to improve their teaching and had an impact on their teaching practices. In addition, further investigations suggest that there was a correlation between the participants' perceptions of portfolios as tools and their perceptions of portfolio impacts and expectations of their portfolio projects. The results of this study are significant, not only for education policy makers and those who must implement educational policy, but for principals and classroom teachers. The findings of the study reveal that though teachers in general do object to the mandated change policy in relation to the use of teaching portfolios as a part of the quality assurance scheme, there are still doubts, uncertainty and questions among them when it comes to the implementation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chiral conducting polymers for asymmetric electrosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Pornputtkul, Yingpit</field><field name="description">This thesis describes novel synthetic routes and characterization of chiral conducting polymers based on aniline and substituted anilines that have potential applications in the areas of asymmetric electrosynthesis and chiral separations. Ionic liquids and novel chiral ionic liquids are used as novel electrolytes for the polymer synthesis and for improvement of the electrochemical stability of chiral polyaniline doped with (+)-10- camphorsulfonic acid. Electroorganic syntheses using bare or chiral polyaniline modified electrodes in ionic liquids or chiral ionic liquid electrolytes are explored. Following an Introduction and a General Experimental Chapter, the new studies are described in Chapters 3 to 10.Chapter 3 reports a novel route to prepare optically active emeraldine salts via thermal treatment. Emeraldine base films were prepared by alkaline de-doping of PAn.HCl emeraldine salt films electrochemically deposited or chemically prepared. Chemically prepared emeraldine base films were cast onto glass slides from NMP solution. Redoping these films with aqueous (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (1.0 M (+)-HCSA) gave optically inactive PAn.(+)-HCSA films. Significantly, after heat treatment at 170&#176;C, optically active polyaniline were generated, as evidenced by their circular dichroism spectra. This is believed to be due to the polyaniline chains preferentially adopting a one-handed helix under the influence of the chiral dopant CSA- anion during heating of the films at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polyaniline.An unprecedented route to optically active polyanilines from achiral reagents using a chiral emeraldine salt inducer is described in Chapter 4. This acromolecular asymmetric proliferation is performed via electrochemical polymerization of aniline in racemic (e.g. (&#177;)-HCSA) or achiral (e.g. HCl and p-TSA) acid solutions using a thin film of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA pre-electrodeposited on the working electrode as a chiral inducer. The thin film of PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA was deposited on ITO-coated glass electrodes using 25 mC/cm2 electrodeposition charge, giving a thickness of ca. 100 nm. Remarkably, strongly optically active PAn.HA films of the same hand as the chiral inducer were produced during the second stage electrodepositions (another 100 mC/cm2) using (&#177;)-HCSA or achiral acids. A possible mechanism for this chiral induction is discussed. Experiments using deposition charges of between 50 and 300 mC/cm2 in the second electrodeposition showed that induction by the thin PAn.(+)-HCSA film occurred undiminished for final films as thick as 700 nm. This novel asymmetric synthesis method presents potential applications such as using thin chiral polyaniline films as inducers for the electrochemical asymmetric synthesis of other chiral conducting polymers. The fully sulfonated polyaniline poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) was found in Chapter 5 to be remarkably resistant to alkaline de-doping, even in 3 M NaOH or conc. NH4OH. Instead of de-doping to the corresponding emeraldine base, UVvisible spectral studies showed that a change of conformation for the polyaniline chains from an &#8220;extended coil&#8221; to a &#8220;compact coil&#8221; arrangement occurred. However, when the sterically crowed amines tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu4NOH) and diisopropylamine were added to aqueous PMAS, de-doping of the &#8220;compact coil&#8221; emeraldine salt to emeraldine base was observed (pH &#8805;11.5), as evidenced by the appearance of a characteristic absorption band at ca. 630 nm. The resistance to dedoping in NaOH and NH4OH may therefore be associated with the electrostatic binding of the relatively small Na+ and NH4 + ions to sulfonate (SO3 -) groups on the PMAS chains, which is sterically hindered for the larger ammonium ions. The redox switching properties of PMAS were also investigated in Chapter 5. The oxidation behaviour of PMAS was similar to that previously observed for unsubstituted polyaniline. However, an unexpected sharp peak at 408 nm was observed for the reduced leucoemeraldine base (LB) form of PMAS generated by treatment with aqueous hydrazine, together with the usual 330 nm peak of LB assigned as a &#960;-&#960;* transition. Thermochromism and solvatochromism of the reduced PMAS species was observed involving reversible interconversion between the 408 nm and 330 nm species. These phenomena may involve a  earrangement of the PMAS eucoemeraldine base chains between two conformations.A novel chiral composite is prepared in Chapter 6 by mixing aqueous solutions of PMAS and poly-L-lysine (PLL) and casting as films. The highest degree of chiral induction in the PMAS-PLL films was observed using a PMAS/PLL molar ratio of 1. The electrical conductivity of the PMAS-PLL (1:1) films was ca. 4 x 10-3 S/cm, an order of magnitude less than PMAS itself. The chiral PLL in the complex is believed to induce optical activity into the main chain of the PMAS moiety, as evidenced by its CD spectrum in visible region. The observed optical activity of the PMAS-PLL films may arise from the PMAS chains adopting a one-handed helical structure due to electrostatic interactions between free sulfonic acid groups on the PMAS with ammonium side chain groups on the PLL. The PMAS-PLL composite films remained optically active during treatment with 1.0 M NH4OH and when reduced with hydrazine or oxidized with ammonium persulfate.The temperature employed in the electrochemical polymerization of aniline is found in Chapter 7 to have a critical effect upon the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA films deposited on ITO-coated glass from aqueous 0.2 M aniline/1.0 M (+)-HCSA. Films grown at elevated temperatures (35-65&#176;C) have inverted CD spectra compared to analogous films grown at lower temperatures (0-25&#176;C). These observations are explained in terms of a temperature-induced interconversion between two diastereomeric emeraldine salt products during the doping of the growing polyaniline chains with the chiral (+)-CSA- anion. The critical effect of polymerization temperature found in this study highlights the importance of employing a controlled temperature during electrochemical synthesis of optically active polyanilines.The influence of solvents on the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salt films prepared in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 8. Polymerizations at high temperature (50-55&#176;C) are required for dissolution of the (+)-HCSA (0.5 M) in all ionic liquids studied, except for (-)-MBEA-TFSI in which solvent HCSA is highly soluble at room temperature. Electroactive polyaniline can be prepared from the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in the presence of (+)-HCSA in the ionic liquids BMI-BF4, BMI-PF6, EMI-TFSI, P13-TFSI and chiral (-)-MBEA-TFSI. Raman spectra of the films generally showed characteristics of meraldine salts, and were very similar to those previously reported for PAn.HCSA synthesized via conventional methods. However, the polymer grown from EMI-TFSI showed different features indicating the presence of unusual chemical structures. These are probably generated by ortho-coupling and crosslinking during electropolymerization. The optical activity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films grown from EMI-TFSI, BMI-BF4 and P13-TFSI were relatively low, and much less than previously observed for analogous films electrodeposited from aqueous solution, while the emeraldine salt grown from BMI-PF6 was optically inactive. This probably arises from competition between chiral (+)-CSA- and the achiral anions of the ionic liquids (BF4 -, TFSI-, PF6-) as the dopant incorporated into the polymer during polymerization. An attempt to prepare a chiral emeraldine salt from electrochemical polymerization of aniline with racemic (&#177;)-HCSA using the novel chiral ionic liquid (-)-MBEA-TFSI as electrolyte was unsuccessful. Anodic degradation during polymerization at high positive potential (+1.3 V) apparently generated low molecular weight polyaniline oligomers whose length may be too short to maintain a helical structure, as the green product dissolved/dispersed in the polymerization solution.The electrochemical and chiroptical properties of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salts prepared in aqueous (+)-camphorsulfonic acid and investigated in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 9. The nature of the ionic liquids employed and the applied potential have a marked effect on the stability of the chiral polyaniline films. Reversible loss of the electroactivity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when the polyaniline films were potential cycled in the ionic liquids EMI-TFSI, BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4. Electrochemical degradation of the polyaniline films occurred in EMI-TFSI and MBEA-TFSI electrolytes when they were polarized at high positive potentials (&gt; +1.1V). However, significantly, in BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 electrolytes the optical activity and electrochemical stability of the polyaniline films were retained at potentials as extreme as + 2.0 V. However, cross-linking involving a phenazine-type structure occured when the PAn.(+)-HCSA films were exposed to high positive potentials in BMI-PF6, as evidenced by their Raman spectra. Racemization of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when electrochemical reduction was carried out in all of the ionic liquids examined except (+)-, (-)-, or (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI. In the later ionic liquid electrolyte, strong CD signals were observed for the leucoemeraldine base film formed.  Incorporation of the cation from the ionic liquids during the reduction (rather than expulsion of the (+)-CSA- anion) and resultant swelling of the polyaniline films may be the reason for the racemization observed in the other ionic liquids.These are important observations, since they open the possibility of using such PAn.(+)- HCSA films as chiral electrodes in electrochemical asymmetric syntheses in appropriate ionic liquids. BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 appear to have potential as electrolytes in electrochemical asymmetric oxidations (e.g. the oxidation of prochiral sulfides to chiral sulfoxides) at high positive potentials, while MBEA-TFSI would appear useful for electrochemical asymmetric reductions (e.g. the reduction of prochiral ketones to chiral alcohols) at very negative potentials.Electroreduction of carbonyl compounds such as acetophenone and acetylpyridine to alcohols and electrooxidation of organosulfides such as methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide to the corresponding sulfoxides in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 10. The expected alcohol products were obtained from potentiostatic reduction of acetophenone and 2-acetylpyridine in EMI-TFSI on glassy carbon electrodes at -1.9 and -1.8 V, respectively. Reduction of 4-acetylpyridine in (-)-MBEATFSI on a glassy carbon electrode at -1.6 V yielded 4-pyridylethanol. However, the optical rotation of the product could not be measured due to interference from the chiral ionic liquid which could not be completely separated from the product. 4- Acetylpyridine was not reduced in (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI on a PAn.(+)-HCSA modified ITOPt- coated electrode to the corresponding alcohol, the corresponding achiral pinacol being instead formed.Oxidation of methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide in EMI-TFSI and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide in BMI-BF4 on glassy carbon electrodes was shown to yield the corresponding sulfoxides products. However, the asymmetric electrosyntheses of these sulfoxides in ionic liquids by using a chiral polyaniline modified electrode was not successful due to oxidative degradation of the polyaniline.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the manipulation of gastrointestinal tract bacteria</field><field name="creator">Njuguna, Peter</field><field name="description">Increasing awareness that the human intestinal flora is a major factor in health and disease has led to different strategies to manipulate the flora to promote health. These approaches include changes to the diet by inclusion of prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible polysaccharide food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Probiotics on the other hand are viable culture of bacteria, which applied to animals or humans, beneficially affect the host by improving the properties of the indigenous microflora. One mechanism of action of probiotics is the production of antimicrobial substances called bacteriocins, such as colicins, that inhibit the growth of their competitors. The experiments described in this thesis examined the potential use of prebiotics and probiotics to manipulate GIT bacteria. A crude polysaccharide extract (HW) from the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidium was prepared by extracting the fruiting body with boiling water. The extract was then purified by ethanol precipitation resulting in the hot water-ethanol (HWE) extract. Groups of mice were fed these extracts over a period of three weeks at a concentration of 150 &#65533;&#65533;g/ml in sterile drinking water and the mice then euthanised after three weeks. Changes in population dynamics of lumen bacteria were determined in the duodenum, ileum, colon and faeces by rigorous washing of excised segments while adherent bacteria were released with the non-ionic detergent Triton X100, which does not affect the viability of the bacteria. The prevalence of haemolytic colonies was assessed by plating washouts onto blood agar. Total colony forming units were enumerated on bacteriological media selective for Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococci, Enterococci and Lactic acid Bacteria (LAB). Results showed that there was little change in population dynamics elicited by extract feeding. The exception was a significant reduction in haemolytic lumen bacteria and increase in LAB lumen bacteria recovered from the colon of HWE treated mice. A multiplex PCR was optimized and applied to survey the prevalence of eight common colicin genes (Colicins A, D, E1, E2, E6, E7, Ia and V) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates. The study focused on 39 clinical isolates from humans and 68 isolates from pigs with post-weaning diarrhoea. In addition, 152 porcine commensal E. coli isolates obtained from different compartments of the GIT (duodenum, ileum, colon and faeces) were included in the PCR analysis. Six individual colicins (E1, E2, E6, E7, Ia and V) and four dual colicin combinations (E1/E2, E1/E7, E2/E7, &amp; E2/Ia) were detected. Approximately 28.2 % of the human pathogenic isolates had at least one colicin gene with colicins D, E1, E7 and V occurring at frequencies of 5.1 % each. Colicins E6, Ia and the dual colicin, E2/Ia, were less frequent and were found in about 2.6 % of clones. Only 4 % of the porcine pathogenic isolates possessed a colicin gene and these were exclusively E1 and V. In contrast, there was a significantly higher carriage (36.2%) of colicin genes in commensal porcine E. coli. Of these, E1, E7 and Ia accounted for 87 % of all colicin genes detected. Six of the commensal strains possessed multiple types of colicins with the most common being the E2/E7 combination. Furthermore, there appeared to be differences in the type of colicins found in commensal E. coli isolates recovered from different intestinal compartments. Seven porcine commensal E. coli strains producing standard colicins were evaluated for inhibitory activity against five pathogenic E. coli of human and porcine origin. The experiment utilized a kinetic inhibitory microtitre assay (KIMA) to assess inhibition using non-induced supernatants and supernatants induced with 0.2 &#65533;&#65533;g/ml of mitomycin C to stimulate colicin production. The level of inhibition was found to be variable with most of the commensal porcine E. coli strains showing little or no inhibitory action against the five pathogenic strains. However, two commensal strains, ILC33 and CC89 were found to highly inhibitory to three porcine pathogenic E. coli strains of serotypes O141:K85, 0141:K88 and 0149:K88. The findings of this thesis suggest that purified polysaccharide extracts (HWE) from Ganoderma lucidium have the potential to be used in further studies as prebiotics in view of their positive effects on beneficial LAB. In addition, the use of colicin-bearing strains as probiotic bacteria is justifiable because of the low incidence of colicin genes in pathogenic E. coli compared to commensals. Finally, these findings indicate that potential probiotic bacterial strains have to be scrutinised for their inhibitory activity against individual pathogenic strains prior to being subjected to further assessments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributed cognition in computer mediated learning environments</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on analysing and redesigning a common mediating artefact in computer mediated learning environments, the 'Copy and Paste' function. Text-based resources represent a significant proportion of the content in computer mediated learning environments and are therefore an important factor in learner/content interactions. The 'Copy and Paste' function is central to the note taking process and to the learner's interaction with text-based content. This study uses Distributed Cognition theory to examine and redesign the 'Copy and Paste' function as a mediating artefact that regulates the learner's cognitive processes and the structure of learning activities. The aim of making modifications to the 'Copy and Paste' function was to increase the level of processing of the content for understanding by the learner and therefore to aid the encoding of the content to long-term memory. A by-product of this process for the learner was expected to be the internalisation of the interaction strategies embedded in the interface. The modifications to the 'Copy and Paste' function involved embedding a note-taking process, summarisation tools and relevant information resources into the 'Copy and Paste' function. The theoretical basis for choosing to embed these particular interaction strategies in the 'Copy and Pate' process was Information Processing theory and Schema theory and Distributed Cognition was drawn on to examine and design a new 'Copy and Paste' concept. Schema theory in particular gives an insight into effective processes for encoding content to long-term memory in forms that are appropriate for efficient retrieval. These strategies were aimed at encouraging the learner to process content for understanding and therefore to encode content into long-term memory in forms that were semantically efficient, easy to recall and transferable across a wide range of contexts. Modifications to the 'Copy and Paste' function also aimed at constraining certain forms of activity, such as plagiarism and indiscriminate copying of text, by designing specific affordances and constraints into the tool. A controlled experiment was conducted in order to determine the effectiveness of the modifications in supporting learner interactions with text-based content. The experimental study was conducted in 2004 and 2005. The experimental treatment involved a modified version of the 'Copy and Paste' function. An evaluation of the efficacy of modifications to the 'Copy and Paste' function was carried out using direct observations, pre-experience and post-experience surveys and an analysis of the characteristics of learner notes. This research offers a new perspective with which to examine the activities of learners in computer mediated learning environments. The locus of the analysis was on a mediating artefact that was available in the learning environment and how successfully the learner was in making use of this mediating artefact in order to process content. The theoretical approach outlined in this thesis directs the instructional design effort to focus on the development of mediating artefacts that allow learners to interact effectively with content in computer mediated learning environments by embedding interaction strategies and resources into the interface. This approach is applicable to a wide range of contexts in computer mediated learning environments.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking blondes and heroes: interpreting Jungian theory and hero stories for women's psychology</field><field name="creator">Marlow, Beth M</field><field name="description">Stories make good psychology; they can explain without being prescriptive. Hero and quest narratives are explored and re-evaluated for what they can offer women's psychology. Jungian archetypal theory, and in particular the archetypes of the Masculine, the Feminine and the Self, provide the theoretical framework. The interwoven themes of narratives, archetypal forms and the persistence of gender requirements are addressed both in the content and the method. The content consists of exploration of narratives - myths and stories in which the theme of journey and quest is pivotal. Traditional male heroes, Jason and Oedipus, warrior women, the lovers Psyche and Eros, mother and daughter Demeter and Persephone and the quintessential hero figure of Christ are discussed in relation to women's psychology. The grand, mythic themes are supplemented with modem literary and popular variations. Distinctions are drawn between "true" (psychologically convincing) and "false" (unconvincing) story-lines. The stories are used to show that the quest narrative is relevant to both women and men, once expanded beyond the formulaic plots of the young male hero braving physical trials. The method, or style, of the thesis is largely determined by the content; it relies on metaphor, especially as traditional narrative plot and characterisation, to demonstrate, as well as argue for, a narrative approach to psychology. It is assumed that the concept of gender is ubiquitous in Western society, and that gender differences have a profound impact on psychological experiences. However gender is understood to be neither immutable nor entirely oppositional (between women and men). My aim is to highlight ways women's psychological issues can be explored and described without having to be prescribed. The thesis demonstrates some ways in which psychological experiences can be acknowledged, validated, even explained, without being explained away.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and distribution of real-time content</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Cong Duc</field><field name="description">The rapid increases in network bandwidth and processing power have led to tremendous growth in Internet applications and changed the nature of delivering content. From earlier web application, which is only about retrieval of pre-computed static content, current content delivery architectures provide dynamic content and enable personalization of content. Recent interactive entertainment applications, such as multiplayer online games, require content to be created and distributed in real-time. In addition, the rapid increase in processor speed has led to various proposals to put real-time computation within or at the edge of the network that allow application specific processing on packet flow such as multimedia transcoding and content adaptation. In short, these emerging applications have a common characteristics that the contents of application flows are processed in real-time before being delivered to end users. We refer to these as applications that require real-time content creation.This thesis aims to develop models for real-time content creation and distribution. We examine both network architectures for delivering content as well as server processing resource management for content creation. We concentrate on a case study when content creation is from a dynamic set of dispersed sources. In particular, we examine the provision of an immersive voice communication service to massively multiplayer online games, which requires real-time creation of audio scenes from dynamic sets of participants. We present various delivery architectures for this service, evaluate the performance of these architectures and provide recommendations based on the evaluation. In addition, this thesis designs a server resource management architecture for sharing processing resource among real-time content creation applications.Our study begins with reviewing the evolution of content distribution over the Internet, ranging from simple caching proxies to content distribution networks and personalization of content. We then discuss current and future developments of content distribution which require real-time creation and distribution of content from dynamic sets of dispersed sources. These include state information processing and communication information processing in distributed virtual environments. While all networked games require state information processing, communication information processing has been recently seen as a key to enhance the reality and attractiveness of the virtual environment. In particular, this thesis reviews technologies and approaches for providing an immersive voice communication service to distributed virtual environments. Several delivery architectures are introduced for providing this service, namely peer-to-peer, central server, distributed locale server architecture, and distributed proxy architecture. Furthermore, we present a realistic simulation model that captures player distribution in the Internet and avatar distribution in the game virtual world and specify two key performance evaluation parameters: interactive delay and network bandwidth usage.In the central server architecture, two optimization objectives are proposed for choosing an optimal central server from a set of potential servers. We also propose a dynamic relocation of a central server in response to changes in player distribution due to time zone differences. It is shown that relocation of the central server in response to these changes can significantly reduce the interactive delay by up to 40% and the network bandwidth usage by up to 50%. In addition, the optimal central server can significantly reduce the interactive delay compared to a randomly located central server. In the distributed locale server architecture, the game virtual world is partitioned into smaller areas called locales and each locale is assigned to a server. We propose two server assignment algorithms for optimizing the latency performance of this architecture. The first algorithm is based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model which provides an exact solution to the problem but is subject to high computation complexity. We then produce a new multi-layer graph representation of the problem and devise a greedy heuristic based on this graph. It is shown that the greedy heuristics has low run time complexity and provides solutions close to the optimal (within 5% of the optimal in all cases). In addition, increasing the number of servers reduces the latency of the distributed locale server architecture significantly compared to the optimal central server when there is a physical/virtual world correlation. Specifically, with a reasonable number of servers, the distributed locale server architecture can reduce the delay of the central server by 20% to 60%.In the distributed proxy architecture, players are assigned to a close proxy and each proxy manages the audio mixing operation on behalf of players and forwards audio streams from players to other interested proxies. This thesis develops an ILP model for an optimal proxy assignment and adapts the multi-layer graph approach used earlier to devise a greedy heuristics for solving the proxy assignment problem efficiently. While the ILP model is unscalable, the greedy heuristics is highly scalable and suitable for practical implementation. This thesis also investigates the efficiency of network multicast in different player and avatar distribution scenarios. The effect of varying the number of proxies is also investigated. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of all delivery architectures. In particular, since the distributed locale server architecture and the distributed proxy architecture are &#8216;dual&#8217; of each other, we concentrate on comparing the performance of these. From the performance evaluation, we provide recommendations on choosing suitable delivery architectures based on the server resource availability, multicast, and game&#8217;s avatar aggregation behaviors. The quantitative study in this thesis will be of benefit to future immersive voice service providers in the design of a cost effective delivery architecture for this service. Finally, the thesis presents a resource management architecture for sharing processing resources among various real-time content creation applications including the immersive audio mixing application. Due to the inability of determining processing times for scheduling, a processing resources scheduling algorithm called Start-time Weighted Fair Queueing (SWFQ) is proposed. From analysis and simulation, it is shown that SWFQ offers good fairness and delay properties compared to current schemes. In fact, the fairness of SWFQ was comparable to Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) and the delay behavior is better than Start-time Fair Queueing (SFQ).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harmonic impact of photovoltaic inverter systems on low and medium voltage distribution systems</field><field name="creator">Latheef, Ahmed Ahsan</field><field name="description">As residential customers become more energy conscious and environmentally aware, the installation of grid connected photovoltaic solar panels for small-scale electricity generation is expected to increase. However, the issue of quality of the electrical supply is as equally important as adopting sustainable energy. This thesis proposes a method to determine the quality of electrical supply based on the acceptable level of harmonic current that can be injected from a typical grid connected residential type photovoltaic inverter system (PVIS). The acceptable number of PVISs is based on not exceeding the recommended harmonic voltage levels in medium voltage (MV-11kV) and low voltage (LV-415V) distribution systems given in standard AS/NZS 61000.3.6-2001 and its application guide HB 264-2003. To undertake this study, an acceptable frequency domain model of a typical power system is developed, an appropriate model of a typical inverter spectrum is proposed and a method for allocating harmonic voltage distortion levels for PVIS in MV and LV systems by incorporating background distortion is suggested. The harmonic voltage distortion levels caused by the residential type PVIS are calculated based on conventional methods such as nodal analysis applied over the distribution network. A typical residential power system is adapted from the available literature. The LV distributors of the power system were modelled based on residential load and PVIS aggregation, and MV feeders are modelled based on distribution transformer aggregation. The distributors selected for LV systems study are based on overhead open-wire conductor, aerial bundled conductor and underground cabling types and the MV system feeders are based on an open-wire overhead conductor system. Residential load for harmonic studies is modelled based on the duration of equipment usage (with typical household ratings) during the power generation (active time) of the PVIS. Active time of the PVIS is estimated from field measurement data. Since the LV system is of multiple earth neutral (MEN) construction, an additional system study is required to investigate the effective neutral harmonic impedance. This study revealed the significance of the zero sequence impedance of the system to show the importance of representing the neutral current within the study. Consequently, the acceptable number of PVIS units is limited by triplen harmonic voltage magnitudes suggested by recommended harmonic voltage levels. Studying the available literature revealed that the development of a harmonic current spectrum to represent a typical photovoltaic inverter's line current is required. Hence, an adequate harmonic current spectrum was developed being selected from three distinct methods. The PVIS spectrums were modelled up to 40th harmonic, and an appropriate model was selected from among the three proposed models based on their compliance to recommended harmonic current emission levels, both individual and total, as suggested by standards. Examining the harmonic range up to 40th revealed that recent LV distribution network harmonic studies associated with PVIS are not wide enough in harmonic range to show some important network wide harmonic issues. Allocation of harmonic voltage distortion levels for the LV PVIS was based on the background distortion level and recommended harmonic voltage planning levels and the suggestion in standards to incorporate sufficient diversity for the MV and LV distribution systems contribution. Background harmonic voltage distortion levels were calculated based on published data related to field measurements from dedicated residential feeders in distribution systems. This study has proposed and identified a method to assess the harmonic distortion levels in MV and LV distribution systems, and related key issues, to assist the harmonic management of these systems due to grid connected PVIS.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations of reason and liberation of absurdity: reason and absurdity as means of personal and social change</field><field name="creator">Brigham, Stephen</field><field name="description">Reason and absurdity are two processes for bringing about personal change, with very different implications for power and control in interpersonal relationships focussed on change. I approach the topic of reason and absurdity as change processes in two ways. The first is through a conceptual discussion of reason and absurdity. My main argument is that reason is limited in the degree or type of change it can lead to whereas absurdity is better placed to lead to profound change. I also make the case that reason is normally based on persuasion, power and control whereas absurdity is a means of turning dominant paradigms and power inequities on their heads. My second approach is to use psychotherapy as a case study of personal change by first providing an overview of psychotherapy as a serious activity based on reason and then discussing ways in which absurdity, particularly as humour and paradox, can be an effective form of psychotherapy. I give many examples and case vignettes of these to demonstrate the potential of absurdity for fostering profound personal change. Since its inception in the late 19th century, modern psychotherapy has sat firmly within the science-reason paradigm. Exponents of the major psychotherapeutic orthodoxies &#8212; psychoanalysis, behaviourism, cognitive-behaviourism, and even humanistic psychology &#8212; have mostly couched their descriptions and guidelines in the language of science and rationality. Before the 1970s there was little reference in the professional literature to therapeutic humour and paradox and though interest in them has steadily increased since then it is still minimal whereas trivialisation and suspicion are common. Contemporary psychotherapeutic orthodoxy now also demands evidence-based practice; replicable, easy to teach techniques and outcomes; and accountability, with academic, professional and financial support now mostly dependent on these criteria. In contrast, since the 1970s there has been a proliferation of psychotherapies into the several hundreds. Many of these developed in reaction to a perception that reason-based talking therapy was limited. New themes became increasingly represented through concepts of human potential, liberation, spontaneity, self-actualisation, Eastern philosophies and spirituality. A new wave of therapies reflected alternative beliefs and practices to the dominant science-reason paradigm and emphasised direct experience and profound change rather than talking about experience and change as adaptation to social expectations. Where a person goes to therapy to make specific changes to behavioural or cognitive patterns, linear, reason-based, cognitive-behavioural techniques can be very effective. On the other hand, to produce profound or complex change, absurdity may be a better approach, bypassing habitual cognitive patterns, seeing the comic in the tragic, shocking the person into dramatically new ways of behaving and thinking. If this is so, absurdity should be seen as at least equal to reason and, in some cases, superior.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the adoption of clusters by SMEs in Australia using innovation diffusion theory</field><field name="creator">Kim, Ye Ryung (Claire)</field><field name="description">SME clustering has attracted much attention to date as it encourages SMEs to achieve competitive advantage through co-operation. Although the Australian government advocates and actively promotes the formation of SME clusters, much academic commentary is dissatisfied with the theory on clusters, in particular its reliance on geographic proximity. The literature primarily addresses the benefits of industry clusters but overlooks the processes of how clusters are formed. This leaves some sections of the SME population underserved particularly those involved in horizontally integrated value chains. This thesis explores the formation process of a horizontal alliance and compares this to Rogers&#8217; innovation-diffusion theory. Through a case study of an Australian carpet buying group, SMEs were surveyed to collect data on the characteristics of buying group growth over a 13 year period. Our results show that the S-shaped innovation diffusion pattern of Rogers&#8217; theory accurately describes the growth of the buying group over this time. In particular, strong support was found for the opinion leadership theory. The use of Rogers&#8217; theory led to a better understanding of the role of networks and ICTs in promoting information sharing. In particular, the research finds that the dominant theory of geographical proximity advanced by Porter (1998a) needs to be qualified in relation to horizontally integrated value chains where SMEs share a high degree of homogeneity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sociocultural perspective as a curriculum change in health and physical education</field><field name="creator">Cliff, Ken</field><field name="description">This thesis used a poststructural approach to examine the introduction of a sociocultural perspective as a curriculum change in Health and Physical Education (HPE). A sociocultural perspective is now widely seen to underpin syllabus documents in Australia and New Zealand, though the form and foregrounding of the concept varies considerably across syllabus documents. While there is little research that has inquired into a sociocultural perspective as a curriculum change, critical literature from the previous two decades suggests that it is likely to exist in a tenuous relationship with the medico-scientific, biophysical and psychological discursive foundations that are frequently seen to underpin both past and present HPE curriculum. Given this situation, the study sought to respond to the question "What happens when you introduce a unit of work planned with the aim of developing a sociocultural perspective into the HPE classroom?" The research took place in two classrooms in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), where the re-writing of the Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) syllabus for years 7 - 10 in 2003 was expected to result in a sociocultural perspective being incorporated into the document for the first time. A combination of a modified action research design and qualitative data collection methods was used as a means of examining a sociocultural perspective as a curriculum change. The researcher collaborated with two teachers to design and implement units of work that focused on the study of food. An analysis of data from teacher and student interviews, the planning process and the lessons depicted a range of discursive and material constraints impacting on the introduction of a sociocultural perspective. For example, the prominence of medico-scientific knowledge as a discursive resource taken up by the teachers and students contributed to social and cultural influences largely being interpreted as "social determinants". Such an understanding limited the possibilities for a sociocultural perspective to be employed as a critical lens through which to examine health and physical activity issues. Opportunities to develop a sociocultural perspective were also constrained by the organisation of the schools and schooling itself, and through the prominence of a notion of knowledge that presented it as fixed and certain. Though HPE syllabus documents have in many cases begun to reflect a sociocultural perspective, evidence from this research suggests that a sociocultural perspective as a practised curriculum change is likely to remain a highly challenging exercise for many teachers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The patterns of abundance and demography of rocky intertidal marine invertebrates indicate that recruitment can set geographical range limits</field><field name="creator">Hidas, Eszter Zsofia</field><field name="description">The geographical distributions of species are limited by either physical or biogeographic boundaries that inhibit their dispersal, or by changes in abiotic or biotic factors that affect their survival towards their range limits. Benthic marine invertebrates display an array of reproductive modes and dispersal mechanisms, from 'poor' dispersers that produce direct developing crawl-away juveniles to 'good' dispersers that produce planktotrophic larvae, which is likely to influence their population structure and connectivity across the range and at their range limits. Few empirical studies have assessed, however, how the distribution, adult abundance, recruitment and fecundity vary and relate at large spatial scales towards the geographical range limits of benthic marine species, despite the importance of such information for effective conservation practices. Firstly, I surveyed the large-scale patterns of community composition and species richness of sessile and sedentary rocky intertidal macro-invertebrates at five locations on either side of a biogeographic barrier, and at an isolated habitat patch within the barrier on the southeast coast of Australia, to test the hypothesis that patterns of distribution of these species relate to their reproductive modes across these coastal features. I found that species richness and composition were significantly different north and south of the barrier. Of the total of 40 species sampled, an average of 30 were found in the north, and 27 in the south. Surprisingly, all 8 species that were limited to either side of the barrier were planktonically developing, while the 3 direct developing species were present on both sides. The isolated habitat patch supported 19 of the 32 species that were distributed across the barrier, and all these were planktonically developing. Contrary to my simplistic expectations, therefore, patterns of species distributions across the barrier were not obviously related to species' reproductive and dispersive modes. Second, I used surveys of the adult abundances and size-frequency distributions of three planktonically developing rocky intertidal invertebrates that were limited to the north side of the biogeographic barrier to test the predictions of the abundant-centre hypothesis, which states that species are most abundant at the middle of their ranges and least abundant on the edges. I sampled three times, from May 2005 to January 2006, at small (hundreds of m) to large (hundreds of km) spatial scales over a 600 km stretch of coast, from the middle of the range to the range limit of these species. I found that over all three sampling times, the adult abundances of the three species were consistently high within the middle of their ranges, but declined dramatically and significantly at the range limit. Patterns of size-frequency distributions, however, varied towards the range limit among the three species, with one showing no apparent changes, one lacking small individuals, and one lacking large individuals at locations near the range limit. These results indicated that all three species had abundant-centre distributions, but this distribution was not necessarily related to changes in patterns of recruitment. Lastly, I assessed how demographic processes such as recruitment and fecundity change towards the range limit for the only sessile species that is limited at the barrier, the barnacle T. rosea, and explored how these changes related to adult abundance at small to large spatial scales, to reveal the changes in the population dynamics and connectivity of this species from the middle of its range to its range limit. This yielded a complex pattern. Adult and recruit densities, and the proportions of adults producing mature larvae were all consistently large within the middle of the range, but declined dramatically and significantly at the range limit, indicating a close link between life-history changes and therefore, a relatively closed population structure. However, a significant relationship was only found between adult and recruit densities at large scales at the range limit, whereas fecundity and recruitment did not relate, suggesting that recruitment plays a key role in determining adult abundance at the range limit. In this thesis, I demonstrated empirically that the adult abundances of three planktonically developing species, and the fecundity and recruitment of one of these species, decline dramatically towards their range limits. Therefore, suboptimal conditions towards the range limits of planktonically developing, rocky intertidal marine invertebrates impact on their demographic processes and thus, adult abundances, despite their potential for long distance dispersal and recolonisation. In this sense, therefore, benthic marine invertebrates with a planktonic larval stage may indeed have ephemeral and vulnerable populations at the edge of their ranges, and may at least partially rely on populations in the middle of the range for survival. Essentially, range edge populations may therefore act as 'sink' populations, however, this proposition should now be tested using genetic assessments of populations across the range and at the range limit.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acceptance and commitment therapy and depression: the development of a depression specific process measure</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Elizabeth A</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to develop a self report measure to assess the core processes of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as they apply to depressed individuals in the interest of further assessing the role of these processes in mediating depression. One hundred and twenty clinically depressed participants and a control sample of 121 first and second year psychology university students participated. Participants in both groups completed a battery of questionnaires including demographic and mental health history, Acceptance and Avoidance Questionnaire for Depression (AAQ-D), Acceptance and Avoidance Questionnaire II (AAQ-II), Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale, White Bear Suppression Inventory, Outcome Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), Reasons for Depression Scale, and a modified version of the Automatic Thought Questionnaire. One hundred and forty eight participants completed a two week follow up including the AAQ-D, AAQII and the BDI-II. The results of this study suggest the AAQ-D is a reliable and valid measure of ACT processes relevant to depression. The factor analysis of the AAQ-D produced a three factor structure with a general factor assessing psychological flexibility, and two second order factors measuring Mindfulness and Defusion and Values and Committed Action.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution to securing wireless mesh networks</field><field name="creator">Qazi, Shams Ud Din</field><field name="description">A wireless mesh network (WMN) comprises of mesh access points (MAPs)/mesh routers and mesh clients (MCs), where MAPs are normally static and they form the backbone of WMNs. MCs are wireless devices and dynamic in nature, communicating among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths, with or without the help of MAPs. Security has been a primary concern in order to provide protected communication in WMNs due to the open peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints and highly dynamic environment. These challenges clearly make a case for building multi-layer security solution that achieves both wide-range protection and desirable network performance.In this thesis, we attempt to provide necessary security features to WMNs routing operations in an efficient manner. To achieve this goal, first we will review the literature about the WMNs in detail, like WMN&#8217;s architecture, applications, routing protocols, security requirements. Then, we will propose two different secure routing protocols for WMNs which provide security in terms of routing, data and users as well.The first protocol is a cross-layer secure protocol for routing, data exchange and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) problems (in case of LAN based upon WMNs). Our protocol is a ticket-based ad hoc on demand distance vector (TAODV) protocol, a secure routing protocol that is based on the design of the Ad Hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) protocol. Due to the availability of a backbone, we incorporate the Authentication Server (AS) for the issuance of tickets which are further used for secure routing, transfer of public keys and MAC addresses in one single step. By incorporating the public keys, source and destination can easily generate their shared secret key based upon Fixed Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for data encryption and decryption. Our protocol is secure against both active as well as passive attacks.The second proposed protocol is to &#8220;achieve user anonymity in WMNs&#8221;. This protocol is also ticket-based protocol. The ticket is issued by Network Operator (NO) which provides user anonymity, user authentication and data confidentiality/privacy throughout the WMN. Our protocol is inspired by the blind Nyberg-Rueppel digital signature scheme. In this protocol NO issues tickets to valid users only and these users can then use these tickets to access Internet or to access services provided by Internet Gateway (IGW). IGW can only verify these tickets whether tickets are valid or not but can not check &#8220;Identity of ticket holder&#8221;. This way, user anonymity has been achieved along with user authentication and data privacy throughout WMN.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning as a game: exploring cultural differences between teachers and learners using a team learning system</field><field name="creator">Findlay, John Gilchrist</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis aims to investigate the first-time use of a tool for collective knowledge creation in order to explain how cultural differences between teachers and learners in the context of the historical development of tools contributes to student engagement and learning. To this end, a study was conducted at a secondary school in the United Kingdom with 92 teachers and students. The study was exploratory and is presented as a series of case studies, using a mixed method approach including discourse analysis and social network analysis.The study was interpreted via a complexity-activity framework based on cultural-historical activity theory (activity theory) as propounded by the original theorists (Luria, 1976; Vygotsky, 1978, 1986; Leont&#8217;ev, 1978) and more recent researchers (Engestrom, 1987; Miettinen, 1999; Tobach, 1999; Hedegaard, 2005). It is also informed by other theories of development or emergence including complexity theory and co-evolution (Cohen &amp; Stewart, 1994; Kauffman, 1995), innovation theory (Rogers, 1983; Foster, 1987), brain sciences (Schore, 2000; Freeman, 2000; Goldberg, 2001) flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) and theories of team development (Tuckman, 1965; Schein, 1988; Losada, 1999). Activity theory holds that humans develop culturally as well as genetically. Humans use language, symbols, gestures, signs and physical and psychological tools to transform themselves and society. Vygotsky showed that children develop in two main ways, via social interactions with adults and through collective play with their peers. Complexity theory offers a complementary explanation of the social, cultural and technological discontinuities and patterns of emergence in cognition and intersubjective relations that are evident in human activity.The literature review revealed a new pattern of childhood development, in which young people are now learning what it is to be human by interacting with smart sociocognitive tools and their peers. Many students are bored by their teachers&#8217; use of traditional monological pedagogical methods that maintain strict social control at the expense of learning. Students are frustrated by a lack of access to ICT and do not understand why teachers rarely use computers in the classroom. One in six students leave school unable to read, write and count, ill equipped for a world of work that demands high levels of literacy, numeracy, interpersonal skills and computer literacy for even the most basic jobs. At the same time, there are growing shortfalls for jobs that require complex negotiation and complex thinking skills to create, implement and maintain critical systems and infrastructure.The main conclusion of the study is that teachers and students are separated by two generations of tool use. This finding is consistent with Vygotsky and Luria&#8217;s original but discredited hypothesis of a periodic pattern to human learning and development at both a local and global scale. The teachers employed a centralized control model of tool use in their teaching that has its origins in the Industrial Age (1700-1940) whereas the students were more attuned to a social interactionist model that is Knowledge Age (1990- ) centric. The teachers were reluctant users of the tool in the classroom and quickly reverted to the lecture, closed questioning and individual activities as their preferred pedagogy. However, the teachers made frequent use of the tool for their own professional development and community meetings. The students were enthusiastic users of the tool and enjoyed the opportunity to use high level thinking processes, discuss topics and express their own opinions. Some senior students who used the tool to recall memorized information saw little difference between the traditional classroom and the team learning system activities. In the role of the facilitator, the teachers' and students' first performances were a chaotic mix of four speech types; the ideal and minimalist set of facilitator instructions required to coordinate a group, inner speech to guide the sequencing of the motor activity, previously learned speech routines applicable to other contexts and authority speech to maintain control. The facilitators&#8217; performances improved when the speech and motor activities became synchronised with the participant performances and the facilitator's fear of failure subsided in a shift from right brain to left-brain control. The senior students who were able to facilitate sessions competently after their initial training, were not encouraged to use their new skills in the classroom. All groups, with one exception, reported they were more engaged, enjoyed what they were doing and lost track of time when they participated in the team learning activity, which was consistent with the flow experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). The groups also reported they felt more aware of their surroundings and each other, which may be indicative of a change of state in the group, from a disorganized structure focused on the self to a more aligned structure focused on the group. Questions and contributed concepts acted as catalysts, which sparked more concepts. In some sessions, the students generated avalanches of concepts consistent with team formation. Closed questions generated few responses. Open-ended discussible and high-level questions stimulated the most ideas and the most complex ideas.The research findings have practical implications for school learning. The study showed that a tool such as the team learning system can scaffold rich questioning, promote high-level thinking and support leadership capacity in students, so that novice facilitators are able to successfully lead a group in complex learning activities after a few hours practice. A new model of learning characterised as &#8220;contagious learning&#8221; which involves playing &#8220;language games&#8221;(Wittgenstein, 1999) is proposed. Learners learn how to create and facilitate their own learning experiences and use the autocatalytic aspects of conceptual sets to accelerate the creation, spread and adoption of epidemics of ideas.New theory developed during the course of the study contributes to the field of social psychology by resolving several of the contradictions in activity theory (Davydov, 1999; Engestrom, 1999). The model focuses on the co-evolutionary relationship between the humans and tools, the automation of speech and motor routines and the ability of learners to deal with novelty and plan ahead. The new complexity-activity theory explains the differences between incremental and transformational change, clarifies the relationship between individual and collective activity, and provides a classification system for types of activity that links the worlds of the material and the ideal.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of hypothalamic neuropeptides and BDNF in obesity and the effects of dietary intervention</field><field name="creator">Yu, Yinghua</field><field name="description">Obesity is a serious metabolic disorder that has reached epidemic proportions and has produced a heavy financial burden on health care systems worldwide. Obesity is usually induced by excessive energy intake and is highly resistant to treatment by lifestyle intervention. Using a mouse model, this study investigated the role of hypothalamic neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors in diet-induced obesity and obesity reversal by dietary interventions. Furthermore, this study tested the satiating capacity of various protein sources (whey, soy and gluten) through dietary intervention by analysing the meal pattern behaviour of mice. In the first two chapters, the mRNA expression of hypothalamic cocaine- and amphetamine- regulated transcript (CART), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) was examined by in situ hybridisation in dietinduced obese (DIO) and resistant (DR) mice following dietary intervention. CART mRNA expression was increased in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and was decreased in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DM) and lateral hypothalamic area (LH) of DIO mice compared to DR mice. These results demonstrated for the first time that two groups of CART neurons in the hypothalamus are differentially expressed in DIO mice. BDNF/TrkB mRNA expression was decreased in the hippocampus in DIO mice, suggesting a weakened inhibitory control of food intake. In the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), BDNF mRNA expression was lowered in DIO mice even after obesity reversal compared to DR mice. The low level of BDNF expression in the VMH may indicate an intrinsic nature of obese mice which makes them susceptible to overconsumption of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, energy restricted pair-feeding eliminated the differences between vii DIO and DR mice in both body weight and mRNA expression of hypothalamic CART and hippocampal BDNF/TrkB, which suggests that CART and BDNF/TrkB expression are related to body weight changes. The aim of the third chapter was to examine the expression of Arc orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides in response to weight loss after chronic energy intake restriction. DIO and DR mice were placed on an energy restricted diet or continued on their high-fat diet ad libitum. An additional group was fed a low-fat diet throughout the entire study as controls. The results showed that chronic energy restriction corrected the obesity status and decreased plasma leptin in the DIO mice. Chronic energy restriction increased the expression of hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agoutirelated protein (AgRP), however, it had no effect on the expression of Arc proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and CART mRNA. These results suggest that orexigenic NPY and AgRP (but not anorexigenic CART and POMC) may contribute to the reestablishment of a body weight set-point after body weight loss. Following on from the above three chapters which investigated the role of hypothalamic neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors in food intake, the fourth chapter investigated the satiating capacities of single or combined whey, soy and gluten protein diets through analysing the meal pattern behaviour of mice. It was found that the whey protein diet potently prolonged intermeal interval and diminished spontaneous meal frequency. This increase in intermeal interval, suggestive of postprandial and postabsorptive satiety effects, is mainly responsible for the inhibition of total energy intake after a whey protein diet. Combinations of whey and gluten caused a lower energy intake, longer inter-meal interval and lower meal number compared to the other paired combinations. Therefore, a combination of whey and gluten may be a better viii formula to provide a high satiety effect and suppress energy intake for antiobesity purposes. In conclusion, this thesis reveals that dietary intervention has a pronounced impact on the gene expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and neurotrophic factors. High expression of orexigenic neuropeptides NPY/AgRP and low expression of BDNF/TrkB after weight loss may contribute to the recurrence of obesity. Combining dietary protein manipulations for maximising satiety with inhibition of the orexigenic neuropeptides and stimulation of BDNF/TrkB might be critical for potential treatment of obesity and maintenance of weight loss in human obese individuals.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing an online community for special education in Bulgaria</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Robert Raley</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to apply existing design principles for the creation of successful communities of practice (CoPs) to the development of a new online community with the aim of (1) exploring the practice of special education in Bulgaria and (2) evaluating the extent and ways in which the online community supports the practice. Research and development was framed by the design-based research approach. The study was organized into three phases: needs assessment, formative evaluation, and effectiveness evaluation. Four versions of the online community were created: prototype, alpha, beta, and final. Qualitative data were collected from personal interviews and discussions held on the online community website. Quantitative data were collected from website usage logs. Mixed data were collected from web-based questionnaires and surveys and expert consultation and usability evaluation sessions. Mixed-method studies of this nature are often described as following an exploratory research design. Such studies begin with the collection and analysis of qualitative data, which can then be used for the creation of instruments designed to collect quantitative data. In this case, the instrument was a website created to support an online community. Findings indicate that the main issues affecting the practice of special education in Bulgaria relate to the integration of special needs and Roma minority students into mainstream schools. Findings also indicate that the online community, called Special Education Bulgaria (SEB), must further evolve to adequately address issues related to integration. SEB was found to be an effective online community but only partially effective as a CoP. It is argued that future iterations of SEB be designed to facilitate an innovative knowledge community on the topic of integration. Such a community would be designed to foster the development of new practices among special and general educators and other stakeholders of the integration process. It is suggested that the results of this study may apply to countries with cultural dimensions similar to Bulgaria. Macedonia, Romania, and Croatia are recommended for further investigation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A professional learning partnership (PLP): connecting pre-service and practicing teachers in a technology supported environment</field><field name="creator">Olney, Ian</field><field name="description">There are concerns about the adequate preparation of pre-service teachers, and the ongoing professional development of teachers in our schools, in relation to the appropriate use of information and communications technologies in the classroom. The current professional development for practicing teachers and pre-service teachers is generally inadequate, often being in short, unrelated doses, and there is an overlap or duplication of many of these experiences. Both groups need to bridge the various gaps that are created during the preparation and as part of the ongoing professional experience that occurs in schools. These gaps relate to the changing of systems and the various expectations of the structures teachers move into. This study investigates the design and impact of a &#8220;professional learning partnership&#8221; (PLP), that was established between pre-service teachers and practicing teachers in our schools. Within the bounds of an established one year teacher education program a small cohort of practicing teachers acted as &#8220;online mentors&#8221; for pre-service teachers, who, with minimal classroom experience, were challenged with the norms of classroom practice on their school practicums. Information and communications technologies were used as the catalyst for discussion and set task analysis. A technology-supported environment was created online that linked these evolving groups and allowed both expected and unexpected interactions to occur. The analysis of these interactions has led to a set of recommendations that will help advise key players and teacher preparation institutions who engage in future implementations of similar partnerships. In the current context of determining teaching standards such a learning partnership will also inform the guidelines that may be necessary to allow a teacher&#8217;s career to be supported as a professional development continuum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Susceptibility of 12% CR steels to sensitisation during welding of thick gauge plate</field><field name="creator">Van Warmelo, Martin Nicholas</field><field name="description">In recent years, the subject of sensitisation in unstabilised ferritic/martensitic dual phase 11-14%Cr steels has been investigated in some detail after a number of failures in service due to accelerated corrosion. It was found that sensitisation could occur due to a number of different mechanisms which were dependant on the heat treatment, the number of thermal cycles and the phases present in the material. All the detected modes of sensitisation could be prevented by stabilisation with titanium or niobium and suitable design of the material composition to produce a suitably high ferrite factor. However, these options could not readily be applied to thick gauge plate and therefore 12%Cr material available in the market above 10mm thickness still tends to be unstabilised.This project was initiated with the intention of determining how sensitisation would manifest itself during welding of thicker plates and whether the degree of sensitisation could be controlled to acceptable levels by appropriate control of the welding parameters. This was done in two phases, namely evaluation of actual welds produced using varying heat input parameters and by simulation of the thermal treatment using a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator. The samples were evaluated using standard immersion tests (Strauss test) and electrochemical techniques.Mode 2 sensitisation was found to occur on all samples and on all materials, irrespective of the welding parameters. This occurred at all points where the heat affected zone (HAZ) from one weld bead intersected with the HAZ from a previous bead. However, the sensitised regions were generally well below the surface of the material and would therefore not be exposed to the atmosphere and any corrosive environment. The exception to this rule occurred when very high heat input resulted in an excessively large HAZ or when poor weld bead positioning and inappropriate bead overlap resulted in sensitisation of the HAZ on the surface.Mode 3 sensitisation did not occur within the range of welding parameters investigated. Mode 4 sensitisation was found to occur on all materials but could not reliably be detected by the Strauss test. Electrochemical evaluation clearly showed that sensitisation was present in the subcritical HAZ on all materials, irrespective of welding conditions. However, the degree of sensitisation was very low. From a practical perspective, problems in service due to sensitisation are most likely to arise from very high heat input levels and welding defects such as excessive overlap of weld beads and incomplete fusion.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical enquiry into privatisation of state-owned enterprises: the case of PT Semen Gresik (Persero) TBK. Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Irianto, Gugus</field><field name="description">Privatisation has been interpreted in a variety of ways. It encompasses a variety of aspects such as ideology, politics, the economy, financial, as well as social implications and the global context. Above all, privatisation is conclusively understood as a medium of &#8216;reality&#8217; construction. It is a policy that does create a newly constructed distribution of wealth and power and reveals conflicts of interests among various parties.The fundamental determinant of privatisation is ideological, which is the government&#8217;s inclination to praise laissez faire (liberalism/neo-liberalism) rather than interventionist systems. The other central issue of privatisation is about efficiency or performance of state ownership vis-&#224;-vis private ownership. Beyond these aspects, privatisation is commonly exercised by countries that are in the middle of a deep economic crisis, facing soaring foreign debt, dealing with a widening budget deficit and dependent on international agencies, particularly the IMF and the World Bank (Ramamurty, 1992).Considering the nature of privatisation, a study on privatisation of stateowned enterprises is argued to be best placed in such a context. Such a study is parallel to the call to study accounting within its environment. Whilst a variety of theoretical frameworks of critical accounting studies are available, this study utilises one of them which is the political economy of accounting (PEA), a theoretical framework pioneered by Tinker (1980), advanced in the works of Cooper and Sherer (1984) and others and &#8216;applied&#8217; in the case of privatisation, such as, in the works of Shaoul (1997a, 1997b), Arnold and Cooper (1999), and Uddin and Hopper (2001, 2003).Grounded in such a framework, this study is an enquiry into the privatisation of PT Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk., a state-owned enterprise in Indonesia which operates in the cement industry. The privatisation of this company was carried out as part of broader policy reforms and executed at three consecutive times in 1991, 1995, and 1998. These gradual divestments have been completed within different contexts. The latest partial divestment sparked heavy opposition to the hegemonic nature of MNCs from various stakeholders. A variety of issues ranging from justice and fairness, job security, financial aspects, to the economic sovereignty have been raised. Accounting and accountants are at the nerve centre of such discourse. Whilst various deficiencies are apparent in the &#8216;construction&#8217; of such policy, above all, the case raises the fundamental issue of the distribution of wealth and power, which, unlike that in Malaysia, the Indonesian government has failed to address.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regolith geochemical exploration in the Girilambone District of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Ackerman, Benjamin R.</field><field name="description">This study examines the distribution of geochemical elements in the surficial and regolith profile environments, about two copper sulfide deposits in the Girilambone district of New South Wales.

Host metasedimentary units and intrusive mafic rocks can be discriminated geochemically at various levels within the regolith and primary environments, particularly on the basis of REE geochemistry and several other key elements, thus establishing a &#8216;background&#8217; geochemical variance of non-mineralised lithologies. Geochemical data were examined within a regolithlandform context, following investigations of regolith architecture and development, which identified two prominent regolith-landform examples within an otherwise lowrelief, erosional regime. At Girilambone North,  weathering of greater intensity has developed a moderately ferruginised upper regolith and poorly developed &#8216;lateritic&#8217; profile, resulting in preservation of surface regolith horizons, while within the Tritton study area, upper regolith horizons have been partially truncated by erosive stripping, with residual soils developed directly on weathered saprolite. Each instance forms an individual case from a geochemical exploration viewpoint, for which strategies for further exploration have been developed. Primary Cu mineralisation within the Girilambone district occurs as massive  pyritechalcopyrite mineralisation within a pyritic envelope. Mineralisation is generally associated with intense silicification and may be associated with mafic volcanism and characterised by anomalously higher occurrence of the elements Sb, As, Bi, Br, Cd, Co, Cu, Au, Fe, Pb, Mo, Ni, Se, Sr, S, Te, Sn, W and Zn. At Girilambone North, primary mineralisation occurs within and below the extent of regolith development, and secondary mineralisation has formed as laterally extensive secondary chalcocite, copper oxide and copper carbonate zones above the weathering front, which extends to approximately 90 m below the present land surface. Moderate surface ferruginisation has retained primary mineralised elements such as As, Bi, Ba, Co, Cu, Au, Hg, Mo, Ni, Ag, Te and Zn within the vicinity of primary mineralisation, while these elements are also enriched in soil geochemical analyses. Strong leaching due to acidic weathering solutions borne from oxidation of sulfide minerals, has formed a displaced geochemical anomaly to the north of known mineralisation in saprolite and soil samples, while these same media did not necessarily display anomalism directly above mineralised zones. Geochemical dispersion has been predominantly by hydromorphic dispersion and migration of groundwaters through north-trending late-stage faults and structural zones. This study also examines the surface geochemical expression of mineralisation over the concealed Tritton Copper deposit in regolith (at the time of sampling) relatively undisturbed by prior mining activities. It is in effect a retrospective study granted that the position of sulfide mineralisation at depth has been well defined by exploration and resource delineation drilling. Subtle multi-element geochemical anomalism coincident in residual soil and saprolite sampling, from this study and re-analysis of previous geochemical exploration data, has been identified at the up-plunge and up-dip extensions of Tritton mineralisation. Geochemical dispersion about the Tritton copper deposit is almost entirely mechanical, and limited to residual soils and saprolite regolith materials at the up-plunge and up-dip extension of concealed mineralisation. Coarsefraction residual soils show anomalous Sb, As, Cu, Au and lesser Bi, Cd, Mo and Zn in soil sampling traverses, and saprolite sampling displays a subtle multi-element As, Cu and Pb response. Erosive stripping of the upper regolith profile and relative resistance of host quartzite lithologies to weathering has resulted in geochemical anomalism of only limited extent at the surface level.A multi-element analysis approach and sampling of common regolith materials is recommended for further geochemical investigations of the regolith. Subtle geochemical associations are best identified by multi-variate data analysis methods, which when viewed spatially in conjunction with other geochemical, geophysical or geological information forms an effective approach to regolith geochemical exploration.The Girilambone district of New South Wales represents an area of relatively unexplored, yet potentially prospective, mineral wealth. Increased interest in the region has arisen from recent government research initiatives, renewed mining and exploration activities and rising commodity prices. The future of exploration for Girilambone-style mineralisation may depend heavily on regolith geochemical investigations, of which this study provides a timely account of two mineralised occurrences in the Girilambone district.Keywords: geochemical dispersion; regolith geochemistry; mineral exploration; multi-variate data analysis.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Please do not lean on the computer. It has feelings too.': The relationships transferred by humans to technology.</field><field name="creator">Harper, Jocelyn R</field><field name="description">This thesis explores technology and computer transference. Technology and computer transference refers to the understandings about people and animals projected onto technologies and computers. It describes a 'felt' sense of the object as an 'Other', as a social entity and agent. A methodology for examining transference was developed and trialled during a series of three studies to determine its frequency, nature and influence on the human-computer interaction, and level of technology acceptance and use. Study One trialled and tested the Transference Grid methodology, which was based on the Repertory Grid technique from Personal Construct Psychology. The Transference Grid elements comprised both people and technologies. Study Two extended the research by adding the individual difference measures to examine their influence on transference. These included measures of learning style (Index of Learning Style), occupational style (Self-Direct Search) and personality (NEO-FFI). In Study Two, transference was found to be common, with 90% and 96% transference rates. In Study Three, the measures of individual differences were included with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), in order to examine their influence on both transference and technology acceptance. Study Three confirmed that transference was common, with 84% and 94% of constructs being transferred. Analyses were conducted on the two TAM contexts, based on Microsoft Word and Kronos software packages. Comparison of the results of the TAM for Word and Kronos, revealed that individuals with high levels of Extraversion found Word easier to use, but had no influence when using Kronos. Word was also perceived as being more useful than Kronos. Participants' attitudes to Word were more positive than to Kronos; they had more interest in exploring Word. No statistically significant difference between 'low' and 'high' technology transference scorers on the TAM Word xi or Kronos variables were found, however, there were significant differences in technology transference levels for both computer experience and frequency of use. As well, there was a difference in the level of Extraversion for high transference scorers. In Studies One, Two and Three the Transference Grids were analysed using twodimensional Multidimensional Scaling. These solutions' results revealed two consistent over-arching (super-construct) dimensions for the various patterns of inter-element clusters. Affect and Effort were interpreted as the two dimensions. Participants' perceptions about the nature of computer transference centred around four sets of themes, based on computers' heightened abilities and orderliness, their dominance, their lack of emotion, and their complexity and subsequent difficulty. Anthropomorphic questions revealed that computers were predominantly attributed masculine characteristics. This thesis found clear evidence for technology and computer transference, although it may occur at low levels of awareness and comfort. Computers were perceived as ambiguous and difficult, offering extended abilities as well as complexity. Affect and Effort were interpreted to be the MDS super-constructs that frame participants' perceptions of the people and technologies in their lives. In view of this result, two further axes were proposed: 'Engagement-Disengagement', and 'Opacity-Transparency'. These results offer an extension to the current models studying the human-technology interaction</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching strategies that support student development of conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium using visualization software</field><field name="creator">Weerawardhana, K. W.P. Anula</field><field name="description">Many researchers and examiners report that senior high school students often have an inadequate understanding of fundamental chemical concepts. Chemical equilibrium is an example of one of these concepts and researchers suggest that the abstract and dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium is one reason why learning/teaching difficulties occur.For the purpose of this study, conceptual understanding of chemistry is defined as a blend of conceptual knowledge, the ability to translate among different representations, and the application of this knowledge to new situations.The study focused on the contribution of multiple representations to learning and teaching strategies that assist senior high school students and teachers to develop conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium. This purpose was achieved progressively through answering four research questions.1. What difficulties do students face when developing conceptual understanding of abstract chemistry concepts, particularly chemical equilibrium? 2. What difficulties do teachers face when developing students' understanding of abstract chemistry concepts, particularly chemical equilibrium? 3. What features of computer-based visualization software support the development of conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium? 4. What strategies do teachers employ when they use these features of computer-based visualisation software in classroom teaching?An investigation of students' performance, in the HSC Chemistry examination found lower performance in two areas: use of language; and factual, conceptual and procedural knowledge. Three possibilities for students' lower performance were explored here through the literature review. In addition, two major areas of teachers' difficulties in facilitating students' conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium were identified from the literature review.Two instructional software programs, SMV: CHEM - Synchronized Multiple Visualisations of Cheritistry and VisChem - Visualising the Molecular World, that focus on teaching chemistry with macroscopic, sub-microscopic and symbolic representations, were reviewed. The review identified specific computer-based visual techniques and appropriate software elements that could be used to address some of the learning/teaching difficulties previously identified. Two studies were then designed to develop and implement teaching strategies that integrated software elements and other resources to address targeted areas of teaching/learning difficulties.The results from these studies revealed that teacher demonstration of software could contribute to the development of students' representational competence, however the integration of multiple representations into other learning/teaching strategies were more likely to effectively develop conceptual understanding. The study found that effective teaching strategies were often blends of teachers' sound knowledge of: subject matter with thorough conceptual understanding; computer-based technologies; and learners' needs.  The study has implications for science/chemistry teachers, pre-service science teachers, senor high school science students, software designers/resource producers, and Chemistry curriculum evaluation and assessment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of flag state responsibility from an historical perspective: delegation or derogation?</field><field name="creator">Mansell, John Norman Keith</field><field name="description">The starting point for this analysis of flag State responsibilities is to recall the historical development of the extant regulatory regime for jurisdiction and control of ships; from the genesis of ship registration in the thirteenth century, through to the development of the nation State and concept of the flag State, on to the gradual evolution of national law for control of ships, and eventual codification of this law into international law in the twentieth century. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) provides for a State to grant its nationality to ships, to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality, to register ships in its territory, and for those ships to fly its flag. With these rights come flag State responsibilities. The flag State has a duty to effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical, social and environmental protection matters over ships flying its flag. The flag State can undertake these duties or has the ability to entrust them to private organizations. A regulatory framework in international maritime law has been established that allows delegation of flag State responsibilities and recognizes the customary role of Classification Societies in inspection, survey and certification of ships. The LOSC also requires that a ship be surveyed before registration. As the flag State has the right to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality it can choose to not require this survey for reasons of expediency and easy entry of ships onto its register. The regulatory framework for jurisdiction and control of ships provides opportunities for the establishment of regulatory inefficient flag States who have the right in law to delegate, or derogate, all of their statutory functions to equally inefficient private organizations. Such flag States are attractive to shipowners seeking minimum compliance costs and regulatory oversight. Issues of flag State responsibility and performance are analysed in depth to test the hypothesis that the extant regulatory framework is adequate in law but, due to inadequate implementation, monitoring and enforcement, does not deliver the intent of the LOSC that flag States exercise effective jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag. For the purpose of analysis in this thesis flag States are categorized into National, Quasi-National, International and Pseudo-National according to their degree of regulatory efficiency. It is concluded that the regulatory framework is fundamentally sound but that it requires effective implementation and enforcement through strengthening in law, supported by sanctions upon recalcitrant flag States, and a greater degree of global oversight and monitoring of flag State performance by the International Maritime Organization.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DON'T PANIC!: an unhurried critique of copyright and the potential for alternatives.</field><field name="creator">Moore, Christopher L</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the field of critical copyright studies through an engagement with the legal and cultural history of copyright doctrine.

Laser-Doppler flowmetry is a well-known technique, used for assessing microvascular function, with raw Q.sk traces displaying marked variability, which is in part due to the above mechanisms, but also results from passive influences (i.e. oscillations in pressure resulting from cardiac frequency (fc) or respiration (fb), alterations to local transmural pressure and turbulences in flow due to vessel structure and or the viscosity of blood). The central focus of this dissertation was an investigation and characterisation of an apparently hidden, novel Q.sk phenomenon, which has not been previously reported in the literature, possibly due to traditional data processing techniques. This phenomenon encompasses high-amplitude oscillations in Q.sk which were detected using laser-Doppler flowmetry in human and rat Q.sk, which have a characteristic frequency of ~0.4 Hz, spanning ~1000 ms, and consist of high-amplitude peaks, accounting for up to a seven-fold increase of basal Q.sk.  Experiments presented within this thesis confirm the biological nature of these oscillations, which are present in both acral and non-acral skin regions. These oscillations, increase significantly with increases in local and mean skin temperature (Tsk; humans and rats Q.sk; P&lt;0.05) and may occur independently of core temperature. Further, these oscillations appear to be unaffected by global changes in mean arterial pressure within the normotensive range (P&gt;0.05). Local application of anaesthetic (i.e. to remove vessel tone) attenuated these oscillations in response to whole-body heating. However, propranolol treatment (80mg; orally) produced no significant differences in the characteristics of these oscillations (P&gt;0.05), despite producing a significant reduction in fc (~ 10 b&#8226;min-1; P&lt;0.05). Differences in baroreceptor loading between a supine and seated posture (as reflected by a significant increase in fc of ~ 10 b&#8226;min-1 in the seated posture; P&lt;0.05) produced no differences in the frequency of the high-amplitude oscillations at the forearm when recorded at heart level (~ 0.4 Hz). However, measurements at the thigh in the seated posture, displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of these oscillations (reduction of ~0.3 Hz) when compared to the supine position (P&lt;0.05). In addition, alterations to local vessel pressure by movement of the position of the Q.sk measurement site above or below heart level significantly increased the frequency of these oscillations (by ~0.2 Hz and ~0.1 Hz respectively; P&lt;0.05). Remarkably, additional manipulations of local pressure by means of upper arm occlusion (2 min; to either ~90 or 240mmHg), increased the frequency of these oscillations in some subjects, while in others a reduction in frequency was observed (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, time frequency analysis, shows that these oscillations occur independently of fc and fb.   Taken together, it is likely that sympathetic nervous system has a minimal role in the induction of these oscillations (i.e. not associated with an active vasodilator mechanism, as this system is lacking in acral regions) and the oscillations occurring under conditions where the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the skin would be expected to be minimal (e.g. hyperthermia). Local threshold-dependent thermal mechanisms (i.e. Tsk ~35-36&#186;C) may mediate these oscillations. However, since these oscillations have also been detected under normothermic conditions in the thigh and forearm in human subjects (Tsk ~32-33&#186;C), it is also possible that local temperature may exacerbate or facilitate non-thermal mechanisms, leading to the induction of these oscillations. The other possibilities are that multiple mechanisms may account for the high-amplitude oscillations, or that the threshold skin temperature for the induction of these oscillations varies with experimental conditions. However, if non-thermal factors account for the high-amplitude oscillations, then the results support a local passive mechanism, as these oscillations appear to be unaffected by central changes in vascular pressure (i.e. mean arterial pressure and oscillations in intravascular pressure due to fc and fb), yet are greatly affected by local alterations to pressure and vessel tone. The exact local passive mechanism behind these oscillations remains to be determined, but is likely to be common across skin regions and species, and the physiological relevance of the high-amplitude oscillations may relate to enhanced tissue perfusion, and or heat transfer through the cutaneous circulation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing environmental turbulence in the microfinance sector - a case study of the Aga Khan rural support programme in Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Khan, Ashfaq A</field><field name="description">Microfinance is a powerful development tool with which to alleviate the problem ofpoverty through providing financial services to the poor. The real essence of allmicrofinance efforts around the world is to enable the poor to break the cycle of poverty by establishing and nourishing small businesses. The international donor community1 and governments have had substantial financial and non-financial investments in developing and providing subsidized financial services for the poor on the premise thatthey have limited access to the formal mainstream financial institutions.There was a drastic shift in the microfinance paradigm during the early 1990s when the donor community changed its thinking and approach as to the sustainability ofmicrofinance institutions around the world. Instead of providing subsidized financialservices to microfinance institutions (MFIs) for their life time, the donors startedemphasizing self-sustainability on the part of MFIs through cost control, efficientoperations, and adopting commercialism. The shift in the donors&#8217; approach, in turn,resulted in competition among MFIs as they had to struggle for more and more clientsto ensure their sustainability. These new issues came as external disturbances for theMFIs which were previously heavily dependent on the donors&#8217; subsidized funding, and they had to adapt and reorient to the changed external conditions.This study is a case study based on the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) &#9472; one of the prominent microfinance institutions in Pakistan. It explores the internal adaptation and reorientation of the Programme&#8217;s microfinance division in response to these changed external circumstances. The study has two different aspects; first, the internal adaptation and reorientation of the microfinance division of the AKRSP to the changed external circumstances and, second, its passive submission to the changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the study resorted to two theoretical frameworks &#9472; Laughlin&#8217;s (1991) Model of Organizational Change and Institutional Theory (DiMaggio and Powel, 1983) to placate the two aspects of the research issue. The study provides insights into the successful adaptation of the AKRSP in which it had to tailor all of its tangible and intangible organizational elements in response to the changed external conditions to ensure its survival and sustainability.The study examines the process of transformation of the subject as it changed from a donor based institution to a sustainable, commercial institution. The study draws parallels between the theories of Laughlin, and DiMaggio and Powell, and the events that took place during this transformation.Key words: microfinance, sustainability, commercialism, organizational change.1 The term &#8216;international donor community&#8217;, referred to as &#8216;donors&#8217;, &#8216;donor community&#8217;, or &#8216;donoragencies&#8217; in the thesis, connotes international sources of subsidized funding for the poor.

The focus is on the British Aerospace BAe 146 aircraft in Australia and the Australian Senate Inquiry which examined this aircraft. The aim is to examine bias in assessment and decision making processes surrounding health and safety by key stakeholders. The methodology utilises an interests-based approach drawing on two broad research disciplines, science and technology studies and the sociology of medicine. A number of stakeholders are scrutinised in order to better understand the health and safety implications for aircraft crew and passengers.Aviation industry deregulation is evaluated to provide a historical context to the often competing interests in aviation. The roles of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau are assessed both in terms of their obligations and claims. The hazard posed by Mobil Jet Oil II, the key cabin contaminant, is examined via research, publications such as Material Safety Data Sheets and government classification. British Aerospace assertions of aircraft safety are examined via its interpretation of a number of studies.The findings of the Australian Senate Inquiry are compared to the UK House of Lords Inquiry into cabin air quality and the US National Research Council study into cabin air quality. Finally the debates surrounding long term health implications such as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity are examined and research undertaken by pilots associations and other researchers asserting health problems is assessed.This thesis argues that key industry, government and regulatory stakeholders have shown significant bias in recognising and responding to the health and safety issues of cabin contamination. The consequences of such neglect, particularly when numerous other aircraft have been found to have similar problems, are increased risks to crew, passengers and aircraft. The risks of cabin fume exposure include short term health problems and long term illness, disease and disability.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the retrieval and analysis of external statistical data by casual and novice users</field><field name="creator">Hyland, Peter N</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a research prototype of a Statistical Information System intended for use by casual and novice users of External Statistical Data (ESD).

This sampling technique is relatively new in the literature and several gaps remain to be filled.  Scientists using this technique have selected bait based on results from trapping experiments.  Therefore the first objective of the study was to compare commonly used baits and test if different fish species and fish assemblages were recorded.  I planned to apply results from the first study towards further research using BRUV.  Management at Jervis Bay Marine Park, located in southeast Australia, have applied a strategy to protect a comprehensive and representative sample of local habitats and associated flora and fauna.  In doing so, sanctuary &#8220;no take&#8221; zones have been put in place.  Surprisingly, there are no patch reefs afforded this protection.  My second objective was to provide the Jervis Bay Marine Park management with baseline data on deep patch reef locations and to draw comparisons between deep patch, deep coastal, and shallow coastal reefs.  I compared three different baits (pilchard, abalone, and urchin) at three locations in two separate years.  A total of 63 &#8220;drops&#8221; (30 min recordings) were conducted in two years and a total of 47 species were recorded.  There were no differences in the diversity and abundance of fish recorded while baited with pilchard and abalone.  In contrast, in the second year of sampling I detected a greater species richness and abundance using pilchard, compared to urchin, at most locations (p&lt;0.05).  The two most speciose families recorded in the study were Labridae and Monacanthidae.  These families, as well as several individual fish species, were examined but there were no significant differences in their relative abundance among bait treatments.  Additionally, in the second year of sampling I detected differences in H&#8242; and time of first arrival among locations (p&lt;0.05).  Surprisingly, large differences between the baits were greatly reduced at one location - Plantation Point.  I interpret this finding as there being a high density of fish at Plantation Point that masks the differences in the attraction of these baits.  I concluded that as the behaviour and structure of the fish assemblage can vary in space, pilchard was the best choice of bait for consistently detecting species richness and abundance.  A total of 144 BRUV &#8220;drops&#8221; (30 min recordings) in 9 locations in 2005 and 2006 were completed in the second study.  The composition of fish assemblage at shallow and deep water habitats was different (p&lt;0.05).  Indeed, depth related differences for temperate reef fish are well documented and my findings emphasise the need for the Marine Park management to maintain protection of reef habitats across abroad range of depths.  I did not detect any differences in the composition of the fish assemblage or the relative abundance of fish between the two deep habitats (p&gt;0.05), although the presence of several rarely encountered species including Bodianus unimaculatus, Coris sandageri, Meuschenia scaber, Caesioperca lepidoptera, and Eubalichthys mosaicus were recorded in the deep patch reef habitat.  I concluded that the inclusion of the deep habitat in the sanctuary zoning plan is important for protecting fish biodiversity.  By generating permanent baseline data, this study aims to assist Marine Park management in making sound decisions on future zoning plans.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urokinase-dependent plasminogen binding and activation on breast cancer cells: an important process linked to malignancy</field><field name="creator">Stillfried, Gillian E</field><field name="description">Cellular invasion is facilitated by localisation and activation of the human circulating zymogen plasminogen. Increased binding and activation of plasminogen at the surface of invasive breast cancer cells has been linked to the inappropriate and unregulated expression of the plasminogen activator, uPA. To investigate the mechanistic link between uPA and plasminogen binding, cell-surface uPA levels were enhanced on the usually low uPA-expressing MCF-7 cell line. Enhancement of cell-surface uPA resulted in a significant increase to the cell-surface, lysine-dependent plasminogen binding capacity of these cells (increase of 37%). This increase was entirely uPA activity-dependent and was accompanied by an increase in plasminogen activation potential. Analysis in the presence of the plasmin inhibitor, aprotinin, showed that a large proportion of plasminogen binding was also plasmin-dependent (70-80%). Similar analyses indicated that this was also the case on MDA-MB-231 cells, which have naturally high levels of cell-surface uPA. Investigation into the identity of potential cell-surface plasminogen receptors showed that a proportion of cell-surface, lysine-dependent plasminogen binding to MDA-MB-231 cells was mediated via a direct interaction with the A-chain of uPA. Furthermore, fluorescent confocal microscopy experiments indicated that plasmin-processed annexin II may act as a plasminogen receptor on uPA-enhanced MCF-7. Together with the results above, these data suggest a mechanism whereby a low level of plasminogen may initially localise to receptors with pre-existing C-terminal lysines and, on cells with high cell-surface uPA, a feed-forward activation loop proceeds. This activation loop leads to generation of plasmin and subsequent plasmin-processing of cell-surface proteins, thereby generating new C-terminal lysines that facilitate further lysine-dependent plasminogen binding and activation. Primary tumour expression of uPA and its inhibitor, PAI-1, is a strong prognostic indicator of adverse patient outcome in breast cancer, and uPA expression is  also associated with malignant disease in other cancers. Radiolabelled PAI-2 (&#945;-PAI-2) is a promising therapeutic which specifically targets uPA-expressing cells, however, pre-clinical evaluation of &#945;-PAI-2 toxicity and efficacy requires an appropriate mouse model of breast cancer. To this end, immunocompromised mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231 xenografts were assessed as a suitable model for invasive breast cancer. The model was characterised for tumour induction and growth rate, necrosis, local invasion into surrounding tissue, and metastases to axillary lymph nodes and major organs. Tumours were also characterised for uPA expression (using an ELISA developed as part of this thesis), uPA activity and plasminogen activation capacity, both with and without &#945;-PAI-2 treatment.  These analyses indicated that the orthotopic murine xenograft model was appropriate for assessing &#945;-PAI-2 efficacy, as the xenogenic tumours maintained the characteristics of the implanted cell line and mimicked the development and histology of human breast tumours, including uPA expression by tumour stromal cells. The plasminogen binding model described in this thesis provides a plausible explanation for the increased plasminogen binding capacity of cells with high cell-surface uPA expression and furthers understanding of the link between increased uPA expression and increased tumour cell invasiveness.  Furthermore, the characterisation of the xenograft mouse model highlights the suitability of this model for the pre-clinical investigation of potential uPA-targeted therapeutics for invasive breast cancer.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magneto-optical imaging in superconductors</field><field name="creator">Roussel, Marie</field><field name="description">Knowing the magnetic flux behavior in a superconducting material is essential for a better understanding of the superconductivity phenomenon. The magneto-optical imaging (MOI) technique is one of the few techniques enabling the real time study of the local magnetic flux behavior in superconductors. This work had several aims: &#8226; Firstly, an efficient MOI system enabling the study of superconducting samples at liquid helium temperatures had to be set up to replace the former limited MOI system in ISEM (Institute for Superconducting and Electronic Materials). Indeed, the former MOI equipment was equipped with a cryostat cooled down via a cryocooler in which functioning principle was based on Joule-Thomson cycles of helium gas. This system had two main limitations: it only made it possible to reach temperatures down to 20 K, and it induced strong mechanical vibrations in the sample holder. These limitations had very disadvantageous consequences for the MOI study of superconducting samples: Some phenomenon such as dendritic flux jumps occurring in MgB2 below 10 K could not be studied. In addition, due to the mechanical vibrations, the sample and the magneto-optically active layer had to be strongly pressed on the sample holder in order to maintain them in place. This mounting pressure induced mechanical stress in the magneto-optically active layer, reducing the accuracy and quality of the magneto-optical images obtained with this system. To overcome these limitations, another MOI cryostat was installed. The latest cryostat is cooled down with liquid helium, eliminating the mechanical vibration and enabling the study of superconducting sample at temperatures down to 1.5 K. Due due the numerous differences between the two cryostat, numerous parts of the MOI equipment had to be changed or redesigned. The vacuum system iv was rearranged to enable us to recover the helium gas after its passage through the cryostat. The positioning system was adjusted to the new geometry of the latest cryostat. A new ring magnet was conceived and built to increase the intensity and homogeneity of the supplied magnetic field. The temperature control system was replaced. Finally, extra wires were positioned in the new cryostat to supply current to the sample and allow the study of superconductors under a transport current. All these modifications combined with the advantages of the liquid helium cooled cryostat mentioned earlier have enabled the acquisition of higher quality magneto-optical images and enhanced the reproducibility of the results. &#8226; Secondly, two computer programs were designed to enable the calibration of the local magnetic flux density and the quantification of the local current density from the magnetooptical images. The calibration of the grey levels of magneto-optical images into local magnetic flux densities is now possible by using an original user-friendly software. The quantification of flux density can now be done in two different manners: a pixel-by-pixel method or an averaging-pixel-cluster method. In the former, a unique calibration curve is calculated for each pixel of the pictures, while the later uses the averaged light intensity of a cluster of pixels for calibration. Although more rigorous than the averaging-pixel-cluster method, the pixel-by-pixel method is very time-consuming and thus can only be used on small areas of the pictures. In addition, a second computer program has been implemented for the quantification of the current density in a superconducting sample. This program can be used on any thin film samples and provides both current density maps and current flow contour plots (to visualize the flow direction of the current) from the calibrated MOI pictures. &#8226; Thirdly, both MOI setups have been used to study samples of the three most promising superconducting materials in terms of potential applications: MgB2, YBCO (YBa2Cu3O7) and Bi-2223 (Bi1.72Pb0.34Sr1.85Ca1.99Cu3Ox). MgB2 thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition with different processing parameters have been compared to help us understand the influence of the film morphology on the magnetic flux penetration behavior. The microstructure of the film was found to strongly influence the pinning properties and the magnetic flux penetration. This influence is espev cially visible when partial flux jumps invade the films in the form of dendrites at low fields and temperatures. Under these conditions, the formation of abrupt dendritic avalanches appears to be structurally driven. The influence of the magnetic iron sheath on the flux and current distribution in the superconducting core of MgB2/Fe sheathed wires have also been investigated. Global magnetic measurements indicated that the iron sheath shields the superconducting core from the external magnetic field, improving its current carrying capabilities at low fields. A local study of the current distribution in the MgB2 core done with the MOI technique has revealed a redistribution of the supercurrents, although no overcritical currents (currents with a density greater than the critical current density) were observed. YBCO thin films were studied in order to gain more insight into the effects of the film morphology on the magnetic behavior. Samples produced with various techniques and with different microstructures have been visualized with the MOI technique. A key conclusion from this work is that a smooth film surface generally leads to higher critical current density. Furthermore, a comparison of critical current density in mono- and multilayer YBCO films produced by pulsed laser deposition shows the beneficial effect of the multilayer deposition method, especially for the use of YBCO thin films at low temperatures. Finally, by studying a set of Bi-2223 tapes with MOI and various material characterization techniques, optimal sintering conditions for their processing have been identified. The temperature and cooling conditions of the last heat treatment were proved to be two critical factors determining the current carrying capabilities of Bi-2223 multifilamentary tapes though a complex interplay of Bi-2223 phase formation and crack healing processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of ecological factors in determining the pattern of interspecific hybridisation in fragmented landscapes of Eucalyptus aggregata</field><field name="creator">Field, David L</field><field name="description">Increasing rates of interspecific hybridisation can be detrimental to the viability of small plant populations and increase the risk of local extinction. This may occur by means of demographic swamping if the production of unfit hybrids reduces seed set and recruitment of the pure-bred genotypes of the rare species. Alternatively, if hybrids are fertile, this may also occur by genetic swamping whereby introgression erodes the genetic integrity of the rare species resulting in its assimilation by more abundant congeners. The rates of hybrid production can vary widely between individuals and populations due to local differences in ecological and population parameters (e.g. phenology, isolation distances, plant-pollinator interactions, relative frequency of parentals). For small populations, alterations of these parameters may result in more frequent hybridisation with cross-compatible congeners, which may affect the conservation of rare species because the frequency of hybridisation is expected to directly influence time to local extinction. Habitat fragmentation can play a critical role in altering a number of ecological and population parameters by reducing population size and plant densities, altering the frequencies of parentals, and modification of soil characteristics which can shift the flowering times of co-occurring species. All of these factors can potentially increase rates of interspecific pollen flow thereby increasing the rate of hybrid production within remnant populations. However, few studies have empirically explored the extrinsic ecological and population conditions influencing hybrid production in fragmented landscapes. Examining the processes promoting hybridisation in fragmented systems is critical for understanding the relationship between ecological/population parameters and the scale and rapidity of interspecific hybridisation. Such knowledge on the conditions promoting hybridisation and the subsequent effects on population fitness may be useful for understanding how anthropogenic activities can affect important evolutionary and ecological interactions and important for managing the demographic and genetic viability of remnant populations. I examined the influence of habitat fragmentation and associated ecological and population parameters on interspecific pollen dispersal, hybrid production and reproductive success of remnant populations of the uncommon tree Black Gum (Eucalyptus aggregata; Myrtaceae) in South-Eastern Australia. Black gum putatively hybridises with two more common species, Candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida) and Ribbon gum (Eucalyptus viminalis) that co-occur at most E. aggregata sites. The three species often exist in mosaic distributions with E. aggregata inhabiting poorly drained flats and frost hollows, E. rubida on surrounding rocky to well drained skeletal soils, and E. viminalis on moist soil along watercourses. The extent and size of most E. aggregata populations has been reduced due to land clearing for agriculture and grazing. They range from scattered trees in farmland to large undisturbed open woodland populations and exhibit a variety of population densities, absolute population sizes and relative frequencies of parental species at both local and landscape scales. This range provided a good opportunity to identify the ecological and population parameters influencing hybrid production at the individual, within population, and inter-population scales.An array of evidence including, morphological intermediacy, genetic admixture identified by both allozyme and microsatellite markers and direct interspecific paternity assignments, unequivocally indicates E. aggregata is hybridising with E. rubida and E. viminalis. With allozymes I identified hybrid seedlings in 83 % of the 18 E. aggregata populations, indicating it readily hybridises with E. rubida and E. viminalis when they co-occur. Morphology correctly identified 71 % of hybrid seedlings due to expression of intermediate phenotypes between parentals, but became less accurate when dealing with backcrosses (50 % success). Genetic markers are clearly the preferred method of hybrid identification in this system as morphology was likely hampered by variable modes of genetic control of traits and by past introgression.The frequency of hybridisation in this system was high and varied considerably between populations for both seed cohorts and established adult populations. Estimations of hybrid numbers in seed cohorts using both allozyme and microsatellite markers revealed average hybrid seed production for populations of between zero to 36.0 %. The maximum levels of hybridisation are substantially higher than those reported by most other Eucalyptus studies. Within adult populations, the proportion of adult hybrids (identified with microsatellite markers) was substantial and ranged from 10.9 % in a large population (Bendoura), to 28.8 % and 24.0 % of the trees in the two remnant populations of Duck Flat and Norongo respectively. These hybrid trees were fecund and produced viable offspring. The flowering time of E. rubida, E. viminalis and hybrid adults significantly overlapped with E. aggregata suggesting that ample opportunities exist for the formation of F1 and backcross hybrids. Indeed allozyme, morphological and direct paternity analysis indicated that F1 (first generation) and backcrossed hybrids are produced by pure-bred E. aggregata. At the population scale, the frequency of E. aggregata in relation to its congeners (relative population size) was negatively correlated with hybrid production (R2 = 0.59, P &lt; 0.01) across 17 populations. When congeners were more abundant, seed from E. aggregata adults consisted of up to 31 % hybrids. This relationship was even stronger for E. aggregata populations only sympatric with E. viminalis (R2 = 0.88, P &lt; 0.01), but there was no significant relationship when considering only populations co-occurring with E. rubida. Hybridisation had a substantial impact on the genetic diversity of seed cohorts. Both genetic diversity and allelic richness increased with hybridisation rate in seed cohorts (R2 = 0.42, P &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.29, P &lt; 0.05 respectively) and with decreasing relative population size (R2 = 0.52, P &lt; 0.01; R2 = 0.42, P &lt; 0.01). In populations out-numbered by congeners, this suggests genetic diversity may be maintained by frequent opportunities for hybridisation and introgression.At the individual scale, the frequency of hybrid production varied substantially between E. aggregata trees (zero to 77 % hybrids). This variation in hybrid production was strongly linked to local ecological and population variables in a remnant population, but was not found to be driving hybrid production in a large undisturbed population. For the remnant population (Duck Flat), local variables had good explanatory power (over 50 % of variation explained). Individual E. aggregata that were more isolated, were relatively out-numbered by E. rubida (within 180 m), and greater flowering synchrony with E. rubida tended to produce more hybrid seed (up to 48 %). With the large population (Bendoura), hybrid production ranged from zero to 77 % but there were no significant relationships with the array of local parameters assessed. These results suggest that the factors influencing the pattern of interspecific gene flow may differ in dispersed remnant populations compared to landscapes where there is a continuous distribution of plants. This could be due to the receipt of high levels of immigrant interspecific pollen by individuals within Bendoura compared to Duck Flat that would override the influence of local E. rubida pollen sources. Alternatively, hybrid production may be under genetic control and individuals may express variation in the strength of pre-zygotic interspecific isolation mechanisms.Long distance interspecific pollen flow between remnants was an important process promoting hybridisation, especially in the smaller remnant populations. Using direct paternity and indirect pollen dispersal analyses I examined intra- and interspecific pollen flow amongst trees, and immigration rates within a large undisturbed site (Bendoura), a remnant (Duck Flat) and a small roadside site (Norongo). All populations had substantial levels of immigrant pollen, and this was greatest in the smallest population (Bendoura 23 %, Duck Flat 25 %, Norongo 44 %). Most intraspecific pollen originated from known near neighbours within the sites (Bendoura 83.1 % fathers known; Duck Flat 84 %, Norongo 88 %), with most of the potential E. aggregata fathers contributing pollen (Bendoura 64 %, Duck Flat 89 %, Norongo 40 %). In contrast, interspecific pollen originated from only a select few E. rubida and hybrid trees from the total potentially available within populations (Bendoura 6 %, Duck Flat 20 %, Norongo 0 %). The remaining hybrids were sourced from E. rubida paternal parents in populations up to 3 km away, with a substantial increase in interspecific immigration rates as population size declined (Bendoura 9.6 %, Duck Flat 11.5 %, Norongo 37.3 %). High rates of pollen immigration indicate that populations are well connected via pollen mediated gene flow across fragmented landscapes. Increasing rates of interspecific immigrant pollen movement into smaller remnants, suggests pollen swamping by congeners is occurring at a landscape scale across several kilometres.I studied seed production, germination, and the survival and performance of seedlings across 17 populations in relation to population parameters (absolute and relative frequency of species), hybridisation rates, genetic diversity and levels of inbreeding. Of these parameters, the relative population size of remnants had the most consistent influence on fitness parameters, with significant positive relationships with seed production (R2 = 0.29, P &lt; 0.05), germination (R2 = 0.27, P &lt; 0.05) and seedling survival (R2 = 0.33, P &lt; 0.05). Populations numerically out-numbered by congeners produced fewer seed (lowest mean 0.8/capsule) compared with populations where E. aggregata was in higher frequencies than congeners (mean up to 2.5/capsule). Germination and seedling survival was lower in small (42 % and 51 % respectively) compared to large E. aggregata populations (77 % and 85 % respectively). These patterns are likely due to increased interspecific pollen flow in populations when E. aggregata is numerically out-numbered and the action of pre- and post-zygotic barriers removing inviable hybrid genotypes. This suggests that E. aggregata remnants of small relative population size have lower seedling recruitment, and may be under increased risk of local extinction through demographic swamping.There was no evidence of a reduction in plant height, leaf pair numbers or survivorship of F1 hybrids and backcross hybrid seedlings compared to pure-bred seedlings at least until eleven months of age. While seedling performance was assessed under benign glasshouse conditions, many hybrid genotypes must be viable under natural conditions because F1 and backcrossed hybrid adults were present at most populations and consisted of up to 28.8 % of adults at one population (Duck Flat). For pure-bred E. aggregata, I also found evidence of significant declines in seedling height with declining outcrossing rates, suggesting inbreeding depression may reduce the competitive ability of pure-bred offspring relative to hybrids.This study has demonstrated that E. aggregata trees within small remnants are exposed to increased interspecific gene flow from E. rubida and E. viminalis compared with trees from larger undisturbed populations. This results in increased hybrid production, introgression, and reduced seed production, germination and survivorship of seed cohorts. Reductions in the reproductive success of pure-bred E. aggregata and subsequent introgression by established hybrids pose a real threat to the re-establishment, genetic integrity and long term persistence of remnant populations of E. aggregata. Management of remnant E. aggregata populations in regards to hybridisation will rest on assessing population and ecological parameters most strongly related to hybrid production. Evidence at local, population and landscape scales suggest that the frequency of E. aggregata relative to congeners is the most important factor influencing hybrid production. Local ecological and population variables (i.e. tree distributions, flowering) within populations may only become important for small and isolated populations. The potential adaptive benefits of hybridisation should also not be ignored, however, as genetic diversity was greater in seed cohorts from remnant populations dominated by congeners. This influx may provide new multi-locus genotypes that may be required for remnant populations to re-establish and adapt to rapidly changing fragmented landscapes and climate change.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancements to channel models, DMT modulation and coding for channels subject to impulsive noise</field><field name="creator">Franklin, Daniel Robert</field><field name="description">DMT modulation is an OFDM-based modulation scheme used in ADSL and proposed for various other high-speed broadband access systems. Existing mathematical models for transmission lines make a number of simplistic assumptions about the distribution of noise, in particular, the assumption that impulsive noise originates at either end of the transmission line. It is therefore desirable to improve the accuracy of the transmission-line model to allow better prediction of broadband modem performance, and to further improve the bit-allocation algorithms and equaliser designs used in DMT-based modems. This Thesis presents a new channel model particularly well-suited for simulation of high-speed digital subscriber line systems. The model extends a commonly-used physical channel model by distributing the points of noise ingress along the physical length of the transmission line. Simulation results are presented for a highspeed multicarrier modem operating on channels modelled with both the conventional and new models. Comparison with the same modem operating over a real channel demonstrates that the new model provides a better estimate of the bit error rates and temporal error distribution expected on actual telephone lines than is possible with the conventional model. A number of improvements to modulation and coding schemes for DMT modems are also presented in this Thesis, including a robust frequency-domain decision feedback equaliser, a new algorithm for allocating bits to sub-carriers based on a measurement of per-carrier BER, and a technique for encoding data with fractional numbers of bits ii Abstract iii per symbol, thereby providing additional channel capacity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A linguistic exploration of persuasion in written Japanese discourse: a systemic functional interpretation</field><field name="creator">Sano, Motoki</field><field name="description">This thesis is designed to explore how the social act of persuasion is realised in Japanese discourse linguistically. Specifically, it explores those linguistic resources that are essential for constructing written persuasive texts from a Systemic Functional perspective. The present study, as a case study, analyses eleven written persuasive texts. This thesis presents the result of the study. It illustrates those elements of structure and meanings that must be and can be utilised in constructing persuasive texts. It also demonstrates how these elements and their meanings can be realised through linguistic resources such as TRANSITIVITY, ATTITUDE and ELLIPSIS. 	The thesis tentatively proposes that in Japanese written persuasive texts, the act of persuasion is constructed via setting up a position that is not just that of the writer but also that of the reader. This rhetorical strategy is realised by elements which i) attract the reader to the discourse, ii) evoke empathy from the reader and iii) state the position that the writer wants to &#8216;share&#8217; with the reader implicitly or explicitly. The semantic style of persuasion is motivated socially, which is explained by the notion of homologisation (cf. Ikegami 1991), a sociological theory which models the identification of commonality in Japanese society. It is within the framework of homologisation, that the Japanese writer &#8216;relativises&#8217; themselves with the reader, and, rather than establish their own &#8216;individual&#8217; position, they establish a &#8216;common&#8217; position with the reader.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career commitment in film production in the Australian film industry: a study using grounded theory</field><field name="creator">Jones, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a grounded theory study of the Australian Film Industry. The study set out to examine the performance effectiveness of production workers in the Australian Film Industry. Following the guidelines of grounded theory it became evident that there was an issue existing within the Australian Film Industry regarding career commitment. This issue arose because, while film workers felt they work very hard putting up with harsh work conditions, they perceived their rewards to be inadequate and not commensurate with their work efforts. This study looks at a case of career commitment in the Australian Film Industry. It examines what factors exist in the Australian Film Industry to commit workers to the industry despite the existence of inhibiting factors. This study finds eight career commitment factors which work to maintain worker commitment to the industry. These factors &#8211; job satisfaction, self-esteem, Hollywood factor, collegiality, autonomy, cost of leaving, volition and roles states &#8211; work individually and in combination to provide worker equity and thus facilitate career commitment in the Australian Film Industry. This research makes a contribution to knowledge in several ways. Firstly, the research fills a large gap in the research literature, as very few organisational researchers have studied the film industry in general, and the Australian industry in particular. Fewer still have examined career commitment. Secondly, the research provides valuable insight into the role of career commitment for film workers. Together these provide practitioners and academics with a clear and focused understanding of the role of career commitment, and its effect on workers in the Australian Film Industry. Thirdly, this research provides some practical guidance for managers in the Australian Film Industry that may assist them to develop better working relations with their crew in improving performance on the film set. Finally, this research demonstrates the strengths of using grounded theory for qualitative analysis in a organisational area of study. Through the application of this research method the study found a basic social process which was an area of concern to the participants and which led to the development of a substantive theory &#8211; that is Career Commitment in Film Production in the Australian Film Industry.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of subjective risk tolerance categorisation methods used by financial advisors: evidence from a psychometric financial risk tolerance questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Subedar, Zaffar</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance assessment methods. Research in this field is scarce and unequivocal, with little guidance on best practice for professionals in the industry. This research provides empirical evidence on an increasingly important issue, given recent regulatory changes in Australia and abroad. Data used in this thesis is drawn from two sections of a psychometrically validated risk tolerance assessment tool. Prior studies examining issues regarding financial risk tolerance use relatively small samples, students, hypothetical investors or respondents of large-scale surveys that cover several financial and lifestyle aspects of individuals. The data set used in this thesis is advantageous as it overcomes these undesirable characteristics, with the majority of respondents being real investors seeking financial advice. The first issue examined is the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; use of subjective risk tolerance categorisation (heuristic) methods in statistically differentiating categories of risk tolerance. Heuristics are rules of thumb or short cuts used when making complex decisions. The existing literature examining the directional relationships of demographic characteristics to predict an investor&#8217;s risk tolerance provides the basis for selecting Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics. Results, while similar to previous studies, indicate investors can be classified into four and five categories of risk tolerance, as opposed to three in previous research. This finding illustrates that Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are approximations that are not statistically effective as the level of categorisation increases. The second issue examined compares Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective (heuristic) categorised risk tolerances to an investor&#8217;s actual categorised risk tolerances. Limited prior research demonstrates substantial variation in Financial Advisor&#8217;s interpretation of hypothetical investor statements. Thus, if Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are effective in categorising an investor&#8217;s risk tolerance, no difference between an investor&#8217;s responses to direct questions and Financial Advisors&#8217; categorised heuristic risk tolerances should exist. To determine if there are differences, various forms of categorisation are used for comparison. Using two sections of a psychometrically validated risk tolerance assessment instrument, Financial Advisors&#8217; categorised heuristic risk tolerances are constructed and compared to investors&#8217; actual responses to direct questions. A statistically significant difference is found between Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective (heuristic) categorised risk tolerances and investors&#8217; actual categorised risk tolerances, consistent under the various forms of categorisation. The third issue examined is the likelihood of an investor having the same categorised subjective risk tolerance as their response to direct risk tolerance questions. Investors&#8217; responses are compared to two measures of subjective categorised risk tolerances using multivariate analysis established in the literature. The two measures are (i) Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance (as established in chapter four) and, (ii) investors&#8217; self-assessed categorised risk tolerances (as established in chapter three). Results suggest that the type of direct question is an influencing factor in the misclassification of investors&#8217; risk tolerance categorisation. Quantitative direct-type questions result in investors being more risk-tolerant when facing choices that are quantitative, as opposed to qualitative, in nature. Also, as the level of categorisation increases, the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective risk tolerance assessments is reduced. This thesis empirically illustrates three important results regarding the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance assessment methods. First, Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are not effective as the level of risk tolerance categorisation increases. Second, in comparison to direct objective measures, there is a significant difference between Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerances and investors&#8217; responses to direct questions. Third, using different direct question types, Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective methods become ineffective as the level of categorisation increases. Results of this thesis provide Financial Advisors, investors and regulators with an understanding of the complex nature of risk tolerance categorisation. Further, these findings support a move towards formal risk tolerance categorisation procedures that are effective under several levels of categorisation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on labour rights implementation in readymade garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh: Bridging the gap between theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Morshed, M. Monjur</field><field name="description">The Readymade Garment (RMG) industry of Bangladesh has emerged as a competent garment producer in global garment business in recent times. This industry has successfully transformed Bangladesh into an export-oriented economy. The RMG industry also became the major foreign currency-earning sector with highest rates of absorption of industrial employment. Interestingly, women comprise more than 80 percent of the total labour force and most of them could be otherwise destitute or empty handed. In a patriarchal society like Bangladesh, the RMG industry effectively challenged the traditional view of conflating domesticity with femininity by allowing women of low-income backgrounds to move from the household to the labour market. Garment trade is regarded as a leading driver of globalisation. Though garment workers gain much by working in the garment industry the informal nature of job and adverse working conditions often threaten the livelihood possibilities of workers. This study focuses on the labour rights implementation in the RMG industry in Bangladesh. It is assumed that labour rights safeguard workers from negative consequences. It is also evident that labour rights increase labour productivity. Theoretically there are opportunities to establish labour rights in the RMG industry but in practice the picture is simply unsatisfactory. The recent labour unrest in Bangladesh is the outcome of longstanding violation of labour rights in the RMG industry. Labour rights can be ensured if Bangladesh Government can formulate and implement a comprehensive and effective labour law that incorporates labour rights in the RMG industry. The existing business model favoured multinational enterprises headquartered in developed countries and largely overlooks labourers&#8217; interests especially in developing countries. The organizations such as ILO, WTO, which are supposed to protect labourers from insecurity, vulnerability and injustice, are somehow problematic in relation to the implementation of labour rights in Least Developed countries. The RMG industry is the lifeline of Bangladesh economy and it has the potentialities to reduce poverty to a large extent by gaining increasing share in the world apparel market. Implementation of labour rights can ensure sustainable livelihood of the garment workers, which in turn enhances sustainability of the RMG industry.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing juvenile offenders: exploring professional practice in youth justice conferencing schemes in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Simone, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Youth Justice Conferencing schemes in New South Wales through the lens of Foucault&#8217;s analytical approach of governmentality. In doing so, it highlights a range of under-explored dimensions of Youth Justice Conferencing that rarely become issues in traditional implementation studies or even phenomenological projects. It highlights quite different understandings of the juvenile offender. This case study offers a perspective on early conferencing practice in New South Wales. While the practice has since been evaluated in terms of the outcomes for the juvenile offender, the practitioners&#8217; roles have not been fully researched. This thesis provides reports obtained directly from the front line&#8212;practitioner interviews&#8212;that are later evaluated as a snapshot of the establishment of reputedly a new approach&#8212;the 1997 Youth Justice Conferencing scheme in New South Wales&#8212;using a governmentality analytic to reveal new tensions, contradictions and insights missed by other studies. These tensions include those between police and convenors, and between ideas of self-regulation and the autonomy of practitioners, which are useful in reassessing the scheme and contributing to the criminal justice debate. I conclude my thesis arguing that the empirical study of &#8216;how&#8217; the juvenile offender is constituted has brought some insights into how identities are constituted and constitute themselves. The empirical research reveals &#8216;how&#8217; the juvenile offender is constituted at the ground level. The practitioner&#8217;s discourse referred to aspects of the juvenile offender&#8217;s personal identity that are brought to bear in conferencing. These aspects are primarily used by the practitioners to build resistance and alternative positions, but have also demonstrated how the constitution of the juvenile offender is an ongoing process of re-inscription through differing professional practices and ideologies. An analysis of the interviews demonstrated that the themes of &#8216;personalisation&#8217;, &#8216;active citizenship&#8217;, &#8216;support&#8217;, &#8216;consumerism&#8217; and &#8216;system participation&#8217; begin to enhance our understanding of the operation of Youth Justice Conferencing schemes in New South Wales and their interrelationship within a broader political context establish and shape what we understand as juvenile offending. While I was interested in power and discourses, the thesis is really about the way practitioners constructed the technologies and rationalities of governmentality of the population of juvenile offenders. Some of those were state constructed, and practitioners were expected to follow them. Given it was such a new program, practitioners in many instances developed their own approaches in the absence of written codes, manuals or training in the early stages of the programs. This is why this study is so interesting. I used documentary evidence but was also able to uncover the way a diverse range of professionals develop and implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies derived from their own professional training or backgrounds to a new population group.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The end(s) of cinema: cinema in the age of digital transformation</field><field name="creator">Martin, Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the affects of digital technology on cinema. The particular question it addresses is whether there is a discrete object called digital cinema with a clearly defined set of formal practices and conventions. In answering this question a &#8216;television model&#8217; was employed that determined the formation of a digital cinema to be the product of the interactions between cinema, television and digital technologies. In this sense digital cinema was not just a continuation of cinema by digital means. Most previous ways of examining digital cinema placed it in the same theoretical framework of modernity and modernism that had been used to explain cinema&#8217;s emergence in the late 19th century. These explanations mainly concentrated on the issue of producing permanently fixed images that the apparatus of cinema then brought to life in front of a paying audience. Digital cinema on the other hand responded to a different set of concerns. The idea of digital cinema was born out of the desire to distribute cinema images electronically in a similar way to cable television. Digital cinema therefore followed a more postmodern trajectory concerned with media distribution and exhibition as a form of spectacle or event. This is best explained through the discourses of televisuality, telepresencing, simultaneity and the kind of manipulability enabled by computing technologies that have taken over to become the mechanisms of technical and aesthetic change. The conclusion reached by this thesis is that while cinema is undergoing massive changes these changes are evolutionary not revolutionary. Rather than constituting a paradigm shift in the Khunian sense into the new media it represents an extension and renegotiation of its technical and theoretical limits to both encompass and be encompassed by the new media. Cinema while being increasingly marginalised through these changes will remain a worthwhile object of study because its  discourses and theoretical structures still have the power to comment meaningfully if not completely on the phenomena of new media like digital cinema.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/48</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harvesting heterogeneity to attract volunteers: an investigation of alternative segmentation bases and approaches</field><field name="creator">Randle, Melanie Joy</field><field name="description">The present research project grew out of a practical problem being experienced by a local environmental volunteering organisation &#8211; how to attract and retain volunteers. The purpose of the study was to gain insight into the volunteering market by investigating whether understanding of systematic heterogeneity among volunteers can be harvested to attract more volunteers from non-traditional groups within the community. This involved investigating a number of different segmentation criteria hypothesised to be relevant to the behaviour of volunteering, to identify the most managerially useful approach to the development of targeted recruitment campaigns. Four separate investigations were conducted. Study 1 qualitatively investigated the role of ethnic identification in volunteering behaviour, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the theoretical framework for the enquiry. Results indicated that while differences were found between ethnic groups, heterogeneity within ethnic groups was so high that treating them as separate distinct market segments was not a feasible marketing strategy. Findings from Study 1 did, however, point to other potentially valuable segmentation criteria, especially bicultural identity, family life stage and image beliefs towards the organisation.  Studies 2 and 3 investigated additional segmentation criteria which emerged both from Study 1 and prior literature. Family life stage, bicultural identity and images beliefs towards volunteering organisations were explored using quantitative data from an Australian sample of 1,415 participants. Segmenting the volunteer market based on (1) family life stage and (2) bicultural identity (Study 2) produced distinct groups of volunteers which could be used for market targeting. Yet, these segment profiles appeared to be strongly influenced by image beliefs towards volunteering organisations. Consequently, Study 3 focused on using image beliefs towards the organisation as the key segmentation variable. This analysis led to a number of valuable insights into the structure of the volunteering market. Firstly, different generic image positions were found to exist in the volunteering market, indicating that a limited number of particular combinations of image beliefs can be used to characterise volunteering organisations. Secondly, certain volunteering organisations are more strongly associated with particular generic image positions than others, indicating that they do actually possess distinct brand images. Thirdly, preference levels for individual volunteering organisations differ at different generic image positions. This information enables volunteering organisations to understand which generic image positions are seen most favourably for them by the market. Heterogeneity based on image beliefs towards organisations thus emerged as the most managerially useful source of heterogeneity to form the basis of a volunteering segmentation. Finally, in Study 4 the results derived from Studies 2 and 3 using exploratory methodology were tested, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour. If harvesting systematic heterogeneity among volunteers is a superior strategy to mass marketing to attract volunteers, the predictive power of regression models accounting for this heterogeneity should be higher than that of models that assume that all volunteers are driven by the same degree of attitude, social norm and perceived behavioural control. Results indicate that the predictive power of the theory was greater when applied at the segment level, particularly for segments based on image beliefs towards organisations. This supports the conclusion that segmenting the market based on image beliefs towards organisations results in the greatest insight for managers, and is the criterion most able to harvest heterogeneity to attract more volunteers from the general community. The results of this study contribute to theory in three ways. Firstly, novel sources of heterogeneity are investigated to assess their effectiveness in identifying subgroups within the volunteering market which are homogeneous in their volunteering behaviour. Secondly, the assumption that general volunteering behaviour is indicative of volunteering behaviour for specific organisations is challenged, therefore questioning the validity of much of the current research on volunteering which typically uses volunteering behaviour in general as a proxy to predict and explain heterogeneity in volunteering behaviour for specific causes. Thirdly, the Theory of Planned Behaviour is expanded to account for heterogeneity, and an additional construct &#8211; image beliefs towards organisations &#8211; is added to improve the predictive ability of the model. Results are important for volunteering managers because they provide insight into ways of segmenting the volunteer market to identify groups which are homogeneous in their attitudes and volunteering behaviour. This subsequently allows managers to (1) identify the generic image position which is most preferred for their organisation and provide direction as to the type of brand and image attributes that they should be promoting; (2) understand which people are most likely to volunteer for their organisation; and (3) understand how to reach these people and the messages which would be most meaningful and motivating for them. Ultimately, this information enables more efficient spend of the limited marketing dollars available, and maximises the number of volunteers recruited and retained by volunteering organisations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visibility 600 metres: reflections on the national monuments of the Turkish republic of Northern Cyprus</field><field name="creator">Adil, Mehmet</field><field name="description">This Creative Arts doctoral project has engaged visual arts practice and academic investigation of national monuments in North Cyprus as complementary kinds of research via an exploration of material memory in relation to objects in the everyday surroundings.With regard to the decades-old intercommunal dispute in Cyprus, indications are that there are enduring habits of representation that both signal and participate in the non-resolved nature of the situation. Without the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot groups establishing for themselves the links of interdependency between how they represent each other and how they represent their own identities to themselves, they have yet to be fully engaged with respect to the history of antagonistic differentiation that they have participated in. The monumental commemorative forms in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are approached as visual elements in the everyday environment, ordinary yet extraordinary as objects condensed out of the flux of events, culture, memory, and experience in an interplay of the visible and the invisible. In this context it is proposed that Turkish Cypriot history be seen as a discursive interplay of presence and absence, where the subject is the people themselves, in which the national monuments began to appear at a particular point in time and continue to do so both as symbolic and concrete form and counterform in an on-going discourse. The visual arts practice stream of the research involved enquiry into ways of seeing and habits of thought in responding to the immediate surroundings. The artist&#8217;s own registering processes and thoughts became included as subjects of the explorations, in acknowledgement of a kind of dialectic involving personal (inner) and public (outer) space. In this art practice, the process of realisation and the realised object are active together in the social realm with simultaneous awareness of the individuality of perception, memory, and cognition involved in the interactivity, and the responsibilities therein. During this project, considerable reciprocity developed between the artistic practice and the academic research. The project makes a contribution to the visual cultural history of the Turkish Cypriot community and of Cyprus more broadly. It may also indicate some avenues of further exploration in research practice in bringing together different ways or kinds of thinking including the visual and artistic.

Arthritis Self Management is widely recognized as one of the strategies to reduce pain and functional disability. Over many years the role of social and psychological factors has been investigated for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but not OA. This study was designed to examine the extent to which social factors and psychological factors influence self-management behaviour (SMB) and health outcomes in patients with OA in Shanghai, China. Three broad research questions addressed were: (1) Do social factors and psychological factors influence self-management behaviours (SMB) in people with OA? (2)  Do social factors and psychological factors influence OA outcomes? and (3) Does SMB influence OA outcomes?A cohort of patients (n= 176) who had been provided training in  the Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) in  Shanghai, China was examined at baseline and six months after to collect data on social factors, psychological factors, self-management behaviour and OA outcomes. A battery of instruments was used to collect data including the arthritis self-efficacy scale (ASES), geriatric depression scale (GDS), life orientation test (LOT), medical outcome study-social support survey (MOS-SSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), alongside a specifically designed scale: the osteoarthritis self-management behaviour scale. The results of correlation analyses indicated that higher levels of emotional support and tangible support were associated with higher levels of exercise-related behaviour and passive activity. However, these relationships were not seen between social support at baseline and SMB at follow-up, indicating that the linkage of social support to SMB is only cross-sectional. Higher levels of emotional support were associated with higher levels of pain, stiffness and functional disability. Increased positive social interaction was associated with increased pain and functional disability. Regression analyses indicated that emotional support is a significant predictor of all OA outcomes (pain, stiffness and functional disability), controlling all other variables.Among the psychological variables examined, self-efficacy (SE) for pain and self-efficacy for other arthritis symptoms were associated with decreased pain, stiffness and functional disability. In the regression analysis of OA outcomes, SE for pain predicted pain at follow-up, while SE for other symptoms was the predictor of stiffness and functional disability at follow-up. When change in SE was measured, change in SE in pain consistently predicted change in pain, stiffness and functional disability. Contrary to the findings from other studies, depressive symptoms were found to be associated with increased functional disability only, and had no significant relationship with other OA outcomes. No significant relationships were found between optimism with self-management behaviour and OA outcomes either.Path analyses revealed the direct and indirect effects of social and psychological factors on OA outcomes. Emotional support had a direct effect on pain and stiffness, and an indirect effect on functional disability through SE for other symptoms. SE for pain had a direct effect on pain, and SE for other symptoms also had a direct effect on stiffness and functional disability. Neither direct nor indirect effects of depression were related to pain and functional disability. Depression had an indirect effect on stiffness through SE for other symptoms.There was no relationship of SMB with OA outcomes, which concurs with other studies, of the poor link of SMB to health outcomes in chronic disease.Overall the results of this research partially supported the hypotheses that social and psychological factors influenced self-management behaviours and health outcomes in patients with OA, suggesting that increased in emotional support and increased in confidence to cope with pain and other symptoms would have useful effects on self management behaviour and health outcomes in OA.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometry of belief</field><field name="creator">Li, Shiyan</field><field name="description">Usually, the researchers of traditional belief change theories (e.g., AGM theory) assume that the knowledge of the agents which have the lower priorities should fully accept the knowledge of those higher priority ones in the process of belief revision.

On the contrary, in the discussion of non-prioritized belief change theories (e.g., Konieczny and Pino-P{\'e}rez's merging theory), the belief changes happen among the agents which have the same priorities.

These factors include complex social, cultural and technological changes, which have exerted a significant impact on the health of the population and have become large contributors of illness, disability and premature mortality (Swinburn, Egger and Raza, 1999). Currently in Australia, an estimated three million people suffer from one or more chronic conditions with the most common being cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancers, diabetes, asthma and mental illnesses such as depression (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2004). Disease management programs were developed as a means of overcoming many of the burdens associated with the mounting chronic disease rate and this is primarily achieved by reducing the incidence of chronic diseases through prevention strategies, delaying the onset of disability, alleviating the severity of disease and prolonging the individual&#8217;s life (Brownson, Remington and Davis, 1998). However, participation rates in such programs are well below their desired level and often reported as being a particularly problematic and complex issue (for example: Foster, Kendall, Dickson, Chaboyer, Hunter and Gee, 2003). This study aimed to determine the most effective strategies for increasing participation rates in disease management programs using prospect theory (via message framing) and incentives. Members of a private health insurance company received, on a random basis, either a letter or phone call inviting them to join a health program. The letter or phone call contained a framed message: positive, negative or neutral. In addition, half the sample population was also offered a small incentive upon enrolment in the Total Health program, that is, a post-action incentive. The results of the study found no framing effects. Given the results, the use of tailoring should be examined as an alternative, and potentially more persuasive, means of communication. In relation to incentives, the use of a small gift or chance to enter a competition prize draw was found to be effective in influencing re-enrolment rates in two health programs. However, these same effects were not seen in relation to the use of a small monetary incentive. As a result, it is recommended that future studies test different types of incentives, both momentary and non-monetary, to determine the most optimum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fisheries data requirements under international law: achieving long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna fisheries in the western central Pacific Ocean</field><field name="creator">Manarangi-Trott, Lara</field><field name="description">There currently is a breadth of literature outlining and justifying international best practices for regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) to ensure that highly migratory and shared fish stocks under their purview, such as tuna, are effectively conserved and managed. Most of this literature has noted the link between quality data and the formulation of scientific advice, which subsequently underpins the development and implementation of fishery conservation and management measures.  However, the literature to date has not evaluated how tuna RFMOs can effectively balance the diverse capabilities of their members, including developing States, so that the best quality data can support scientific analyses on impacts of fishing.  This thesis examines and analyses the implementation of international legal requirements, and application of international best practices, for fisheries data by a relatively young tuna RFMO: the Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC).  The WCPFC was established following the adoption of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and is responsible for ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of 50% of current global principal market tuna catch.  Approximately 20% of global tuna resources are taken in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Pacific Islands States, and Pacific Island States therefore have a vested interest in ensuring that the best quality fisheries data underpins scientific advice.  This thesis reviews the innovative and collective approaches established by Pacific Island States and their contribution towards WCPFC data practices.  Also examined are the future implications of WCPFC data practices for Pacific Island States.    	International law requires States to provide fisheries data to tuna RFMOs.  Scientific analyses of impacts of fishing require fisheries data covering characteristics of tuna and the surrounding ecosystem, the catch and effort of the fisheries, the characteristics of the fisheries themselves and their response to fishing.  Consistent with a sustainable and responsible approach to fisheries management, data should also cover species that are not targeted but may be impacted on by the fisheries, or that are dependent on or found in association with tunas.  To ensure the best quality data can support scientific analyses on impacts of fishing, tuna RFMOs need: to establish: databases to compile these data; to establish integrated data verification schemes to check that data is complete and accurate; and arrangements to share fisheries data must include the requirement to maintain confidentiality.  At the global level, data on tuna fisheries is compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and institutional arrangements have been established to cross-check with data compiled at the regional level by tuna RFMOs.  	Pacific Island States have established practices to collect and share data on fishing activities in their EEZ, data needed to support stock assessment, vessel and gear information, and data on non-target species.  These same data collection practices for Pacific Island States have formed the foundation of WCPFC data practices.  The use of existing regional arrangements and standards has enabled the WCPFC to meet international legal requirements and to make significant progress towards achieving international recommended best practices for tuna RFMOs.  However, there are gaps in the implementation of data requirements by WCPFC members, and progress can be made to further improve the quality of data, notably more complete coverage and improved accuracy.  	This thesis concludes that if the WCPFC is to receive the best quality data, it is contingent on: first, coastal States, particularly Pacific Island States, continuing to take responsibility for leading the establishment and implementation of effective WCPFC data practices; second, the WCPFC establish a process to regularly assess WCPFC members data provision to the WCPFC; and third, the WCPFC continue progress to establish an integrated WCPFC verification scheme.  Additionally, the Joint Tuna RFMO process could also be used to maintain pressure for the WCPFC to adopt best practice standards for tuna RFMOs.  Ultimately, the achievement of long-term conservation and sustainable use of tuna fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean will depend on sufficient political will by all WCPFC members to heed scientific advice, and take effective conservation and management action in accordance with the precautionary approach.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An overview of Cochin Ceramics in Taiwan with an emphasis on the influence of Hong Kun-Fu and his school - 1910s to 1980s</field><field name="creator">Shih, Huei-Mei</field><field name="description">The Cochin ceramic is a fragile and delicate folk art, with a high aesthetic value. It was introduced to Taiwan from China two hundred years ago, and gradually developed and matured in Taiwan, resulting in a unique Taiwanese art form. Cochin ceramic was extensively used as architectural decorations for temples, family worship sites or luxurious houses in Taiwan before the 1950s. The ceramic figurines have the functions of decoration, and their auspicious symbols can fend off wicked forces and are emblems for a fortunate life. The legendary stories have scenes with Chinese moral and ethical adages which serve as cultural messages to the population. Cochin ceramic scenes and figures were closely bound with the people&#8217;s lives, and contained the essence of Taiwan folk art as a distinctive artistic history. After the 1950s Cochin ceramic was mainly used only in Taiwanese temples. Due to a lack of recognition of its important heritage significance, most of the early made Cochin ceramic in Taiwan is disappearing. My research emphasizes that it is important to preserve and keep a record of this valuable ceramic history. This thesis explores the decorative Cochin ceramics in Taiwanese temples from the 1910s-1990s, mainly focusing on the investigation of one of the most famous Chinese potters Hong Kunfu (ca.1885-1945) and five of his Taiwanese apprentices. The main purpose of my research is to document Hong&#8217;s origins, development of his school, their technique, and the stylistic characteristics of their works. This study demonstrates how their achievements have contributed to the development of Taiwanese Cochin ceramic. Through my fieldwork in Taiwan and China, I discovered more details of Hong&#8217;s School and the techniques and culture of Taiwanese Cochin ceramic. Based on the data collected, I have classified and compared the different features of Cochin ceramic work, and identified the difference styles among Hong School craftsmen. The thesis is organized as an exploration of the origin of Cochin ceramic, its evolution in Taiwan and a biographical sketch of Hong Kunfu and his successors, and their art works in Taiwan. This documenting of the existing Cochin figures helps the appreciation of a precious heritage in Taiwan.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security for PDAs</field><field name="creator">Huang, Jianyong</field><field name="description">Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are one of the most popular computing tools nowadays. Compared with desktop and notebook computers, PDAs are smaller, lighter and can be carried everywhere. However, PDAs have several limitations. They use smaller microprocessors which are much slower than their PC counterparts. Their lack of computational power makes it very difficult to perform some heavy computations, such as generating RSA keys, which needs large prime numbers. Thus, it is useful to have a combination of a PC and a PDA, where the PC performs heavy computations to assist the PDA. This scenario is feasible as long as we assure that the PC will not learn the secret of the PDA. We propose two schemes, which involve some server-aided computations, where the server will not learn the PDAs secret from the interaction. This thesis also investigates the security of PDAs when they are used to perform some cryptographic applications. Due to the limited computational power of PDAs, such computations require some amount of time (and battery life). We show that by observing one of the parameters, we can reduce the hard problem being predictable. We also propose how to securely generate these kinds of computations in PDAs by using some different techniques, so that it will not reveal any additional information to a passive eavesdropper. In addition, along with their popularity, handheld devices are starting to become the target for attackers, who are mainly interested in gaining the data stored in handheld devices. In this thesis, we review the security threats to handheld computers and propose two possible solutions. The first solution is to use a desktop computer to act as a bastion host to protect the handheld computer. The second proposed solution is to build a personal firewall for handheld computers.Keywords:</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A clinically valid simulator with tactile sensing to train specialists to perform cochlear implantation</field><field name="creator">Todd, Catherine A</field><field name="description">Cochlear implantation is a maximally invasive surgical procedure aimed at overcoming human inaudibility and providing the sensation of sound to thousands of severely deaf recipients worldwide. Specialists require extensive training to perform the surgery, yet traditional approaches such as cadaver dissection and device insertion can prove costly. Alternative training schemes have not been developed, however surgical simulators that offer force feedback during anatomical model manipulation may provide the answer. In the work, a novel approach to medical education is presented. It combines haptic technology and computer visualisation to recreate cochlear implantation in a virtual environment. The surgical simulator provides visual and haptic rendering during cochlear implant insertion into a virtual model of the human Scala Tympani. As the user inserts the sub-sampled array into a three-dimensional, reproducible representation of the Scala Tympani, collisions between the electrode and Scala Tympani walls are detected. In response, real-time forces are delivered back through the haptic device in a closed loop control system.Insertion studies are performed to evaluate the cochlear implant insertion process. Electrode array trajectories and output forces are monitored during device insertion into a synthetic model of the Scala Tympani. The force, torque and position data produced from the experiments are used in the final stage of work for simulator validation. A three-dimensional, surface description of the human Scala Tympani is derived from measured data and parameterised for future reproduction. It is visualised in a virtual environment, the Reachin Application Programming Interface, where visual and haptic rendering is implemented to make the insertion process interactive. Algorithms are produced and program optimisations performed to enable real-time, dynamic manipulation of the environment. Real world physical attributes are added to the Scala Tympani surfaces and electrode carrier to make the scene more realistic. System validation is performed by statistical and qualitative comparisons between the force profiles produced from the simulation and experimentation. The results are presented and evaluated in terms of overall system performance.The thesis offers unique approaches for simulator design, development and validation. The significant contributions of the work are reported, as are the benefits, with recommendations for future system enhancements.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of exercise and diet on rat skeletal muscle phospholipid molecular species profile: an electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric analysis</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Todd W.</field><field name="description">Biological membranes separate cells from the external milieu and compartmentalise organelles within a cell, providing a specialised environment for many specific biochemical processes. They exist as bilayers of amphipathic lipids arranged with their hydrophobic moieties internalised and their hydrophilic regions directed to the membrane surfaces. Numerous proteins are also associated with membranes and are bound to the lipids by ionic or hydrophobic interactions. Phospholipids, however, are the major constituent of biological membranes and thus have a large influence upon the physical properties of the membrane and the many cellular functions membranes participate in. To date our understanding of membrane lipid composition has been limited to phospholipid class or fatty acid analysis, primarily by thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. The results obtained by these techniques provide considerable evidence demonstrating an association between various metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and obesity and skeletal muscle phospholipid content. There is also a large pool of evidence confirming an effect of diet and exercise on the phospholipid fatty acid content of skeletal muscle membranes. Furthermore, these changes appear to have ameliorating effects upon the aforementioned metabolic disorders. An understanding of alterations in whole phospholipid molecular species induced by exercise and diet, however, is very limited. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the analysis of biological membranes at this whole molecule level. In this thesis, a comparative analysis of skeletal muscle phospholipid molecular species profile between oxidative and glycolytic rat skeletal muscle and the effect of exercise and diet on these profiles have been performed using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Therefore, the primary aim of this thesis was to develop mass spectrometric techniques for analysing relative changes in phospholipid molecular species profile using a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass spectrometer. To achieve this both total lipid and phospholipid extracts from various rat tissues such as brain, liver and skeletal muscle were obtained and used to (i) optimise instrument settings, (ii) ensure accurate identification of phospholipid molecular species, and (iii) ensure the reproducibility of results. A normalisation procedure was then developed so that comparative analysis between groups could be performed. This was achieved by presenting the ion abundance of each phospholipid molecular species (after isotope corrections) as a percentage of the total ion abundance of all identified phospholipids within the m/z range analysed. The results obtained by the developed MS method were then compared to those attained by established GC methods and found to be in agreement, thus demonstrating the validity of the technique. The methodology thus established was used to determine the effect of two exercise training intensities on the phospholipid profile of both glycolytic and oxidative muscle fibres of female Sprague-Dawley rats fed a standard laboratory chow diet. Animals were divided randomly into three training groups: control, which performed no exercise training; low intensity (8 m min-1) treadmill running; or high intensity (28 m min-1) treadmill running. All exercise-trained rats ran 1000 m session-1, 4 days wk-1 for 4 wks and were killed 48 h after the last training bout. Exercise training was found to produce no novel phospholipid species but was associated with significant alterations in the relative abundance of a number of phospholipid molecular species. These changes were more prominent in glycolytic (white vastus lateralis) than in oxidative (red vastus lateralis) muscle fibres. The largest observed change was a decrease of approximately 20 % in the abundance of 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl phosphatidylethanolamine [PE(18:0,22:6), P(less than)0.001] ions in both the low and high intensity training regimes in glycolytic fibres. Increases in the abundance of 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl phopshatidic acid [PA(18:1,18:2), P(less than)0.001] and 1-alkenylpalmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine [Plasmenyl PE(16:0,18:2), P(less than)0.005] ions were also observed for both training regimes in glycolytic fibres. The same exercise protocol was then performed by Sprague-Dawley rats fed a carbohydrate-free, high-fat diet and the skeletal muscle phospholipid molecular species profiles analysed. In agreement with the previous study, no novel molecular species were observed in the exercised rats yet significant changes in the relative abundance of various phospholipid molecular species were apparent. In contrast, however, the observed changes were more prominent in oxidative than glycolytic muscle fibres. The largest effect of exercise was found to be an increase of approximately 28 % in 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine [PC(16:0,18:2), P(less than)0.05] ions in oxidative muscle of rats in the low intensity training group when compared to the sedentary animals. The phospholipid molecular species profile was found to be similar in both the oxidative and glycolytic muscles, however, a number of differences in the abundance of particular molecular species were observed. Of particular interest is the higher abundance of PE(18:0,22:6) in red vastus lateralis when compared to white vastus lateralis. In spite of the fact that the high-fat diet was completely deficient in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids the ratio of PE(18:0,22:6) in oxidative to glycolytic muscle was almost identical across both diet groups. For example, in the sedentary rats this ratio was 1.35 for the carbohydrate diet group and 1.32 for the fat diet group. It is concluded that exercise training results in a significant level of membrane remodelling at the level of phospholipid molecular species and that traditional methods used to analyse phospholipids such as TLC and GC are not able to uncover these changes. Moreover, it is probable that the observed changes will have effects upon the activity of various membrane bound proteins and in turn cell function. At present an understanding of the role specific phospholipid molecular species play in membrane function is extremely limited and further correlative and manipulative studies are required to remedy this. It is likely that electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry will play a significant role in these future studies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of mitochondrial genomes and phylogenetic relationships in the hymenoptera</field><field name="creator">Castro, Lyda Raquel</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the phylogenetic relationships in the Hymenoptera as well as the mitochondrial (mt) genomics of the group with a comparative approach. My principal purposes were to (1) reconstruct the phylogenetic relationshisps among the Apocrita, and (2) characterize the mt genome of the Hymenoptera and its utility as a phylogenetic marker both within the Apocrita and within the Holometabola. In order to achieve these aims: (1) 550 bp of the 18S gene were sequenced in 87 apocritan taxa and analyzed using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach, including the sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cox1, 16S) and another nuclear gene (28S) from Dowton and Austin (2001). Although the phylogeny of the Apocrita was not totally resolved, I was able to support some groups. In particular, the monophyly of the Proctotrupomorpha, and within this group the Chalcidoidea as sister taxon to the Diapriidae + Monomachidae + Maamingidae clade were consistenly recovered and supported by high posterior probabilities. (2) Most of the mt genome of the sawfly Perga condei was sequenced. 12 protein coding genes, 16 trn genes, and the small and large rRNA genes, for a total of 13,416 bp. This mt genome has a conserved gene order, with the exception that tnaLCUN was not found in the position considered ancestral to insects and crustaceans (Boore et al. 1998, Flook et al. 1995). Apart from this rearrangement, the organization of the genes in Perga condei matches perfectly with distant species such as Drosophila melanogaster (Lewis et al. 1994) or Triatoma dimidiata (Dotson and Beard 2001). The base composition, the amino acid composition, and the codon usage of the mt genome of P. condei were reported. Similar to other insect mt genomes, this genome is A+T rich, and there is a correlation between the base composition and amino acid occurrence, with A+T rich codons predominating. (3) Two other mt genomes of the Hymenoptera were also sequenced. The mt genome of Vanhornia eucnemidarum and of Primeuchroeus sp., both from the suborder Apocrita. Within the Apocrita, high rates of molecular evolution, compositional bias and gene rearrangements had been reported (Dowton and Austin 1997, Dowton et al. 2003). The mt genomes of Vanhornia and Primeuchroeus are further evidence of an increased rate of gene rearrangement within the Apocrita. In particular, there is a total of six trn genes rearranged in Vanhornia eucnemidarum. Additionally, several non-coding regions were found in the mt genome of Vanhornia eucnemidarum. One of these non-coding regions is around 600 bp long and has a high AT content, but does not seem to correspond to the typical A+T rich region present in other insect mt genomes. There are at least nine trn genes rearranged in the mt genome of Primeuchroeus sp. Further, the large and small rRNA genes are inverted. In both species, rearrangements of trn genes are the most common. The gene rearrangements found in the mt genomes of the hymenopteran taxa sequenced were characterized; however no synapomorphies were detected. Since the rate of gene rearrangement appears to be increased in this group of insects, only with increased taxon sampling will phylogeneticaly informative rearrangements be found. (4) Finally, the mt genome sequences previously described were tested as phylogenetic markers to reconstruct relationships both within the Holometabola and within the Hymenoptera. Results indicated that phylogenetic analyses using mt genomes were susceptible to outgroup and ingroup selection as well as analytical model. Analyses excluding 3rd codon positions were found to be the best model to analyze this type of data, but an increased taxonomic sampling within the Apocrita as well as within the outgroups is required to recover appropriate phylogenetic relationships.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men on the move: the politics of the men's movement</field><field name="creator">Karoski, Spase</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploration of the reasons why men join the men's movement. The study combines a literature review of the men's movement with ethnographic empirical research using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. It also draws on participant observation of various men's movement events such as men's groups meetings, weekend gatherings and festivals. Themes and issues explored in the thesis include men's gender role disorientation, the impact of relationship break-ups, fathering and boys' issues, men's health, problems with emotional expressiveness and issues of social isolation. Collectively, these and other issues have given rise to the notion of a crisis in masculine identity, or 'the masculinity crisis'. While there is no consensus about the existence of such a 'crisis', men's endeavours to deal with these issues have lead to the emergence of the men's movement. This study identifies four major theoretical positions and men's movement groupings to examine men's issues. They include: the Profeminist strand, Fathers' Rights, the Mythopoetic, and the Inclusives' men's movement. The review of the literature revealed that the 'grassroots' element of the men's movement is an under-researched social terrain. It also highlights existing discrepancy between the men's movement activities and academic analysis of them. Hence this study is a pioneering work using grounded theory to give representation to the voices of the participants in the men's movement on a range of issues confronting men today. Its scope goes beyond the previously dominant feminist perspective to interrogate the different issues experienced by men from each of the four theoretical men's movement perspectives. The findings of the study help to elucidate the nature of the men's movement and its likely trajectory. It traces the evolution of the men's movement in Australia and maps the ideological positions of the different men's movement strands on a range of social issues affecting men. The study concludes that the main reasons why men join the men's movement are both ideological and personal. The personal aspect relates to the experience of chronic or acute personal crises and the seeking of support and healing to deal with predicaments. The ideological causes relate to men's support of the feminist cause or reactions against feminism and the perceived gender inequity in service provision. The empirical findings also illustrated a dialectical interplay of ideological worldviews with regard to gender relationships and personal reasons, including pain associated with the impact of contemporary industrial reforms, gender relationships and masculinity changes which inform their beliefs and understanding, and motivate their continuing involvement. Overwhelmingly, the study found the feminist movement to be the main catalyst for men joining the men's movement either in support of or as a reaction to its impact on the lives of men. In particular, some men who have joined the men's movement in support of feminism have also discovered that their participation has addressed previously unacknowledged personal issues. Similarly, men who initially participate because of personal crises experience an evolution in their ideological beliefs which motivates their continuing involvement. The findings of the study indicate that men are changing, perhaps not at a rate and intensity women may want, or in a direction that some masculinity observers may wish for, but men are changing. Signs of change include men spending more time with their children, doing more domestic work, engaging in more democratic relationships with women, paying more attention to their physical and emotional health, and developing greater intimacy with other men. The findings of the study emphasise that there is no room for complacency or attributions of blame in the gender relationship discourse. They indicate that there is a need for both women and men to engage in open public gender debate out of which new gender relationship paradigms will emerge.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on advanced active materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yao</field><field name="description">The objectives of the Ph.D project were: (1) to prepare and study advanced active materials with high capacity and long cycle life for rechargeable lithium ion batteries; (2)to understand the relationship between the structural, physical, and  lectrochemical properties of the electrode materials; (3) to identify the main parameters which are responsible for the differences in electrochemical behaviour. In this study, several methods have been used to improve the performance of electrodes, including element substitution, synthesis methods, carbon-enriching, etc.A starting point for the study was a survey of the literature pertaining to the cathode and anode materials for lithium ion batteries. Many different electrode materials are described. The thesis provides a detailed description of the status of current research and development in electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. A variety of cathode materials have been investigated. Some of them have shown good electrochemical performance when used in lithium ion cells. Electroactive LiCoxMnyNi1- x-yO2 powders were prepared from lithium compounds and CoxMnyNi1-x-y(OH)2 precursor by heating at 850-900 &#176;C.High density spherical LiCo0.25Ni0.75O2 compounds were synthesized from lithium compounds and spherical Co0.25Ni0.75 (OH)2 precursor by heating in oxygen at 750&#176;C and 800&#176;C for 12 hrs. The structural characteristics of the compounds were determined by x-ray diffraction. The best sintering temperature was found to be 800 &#176;C, in terms of stabilising the layered structure and improving the cycle life. It was found that the spherical LiCo0.25Ni0.75O2 compounds sintered at 800 &#176;C have a highly ordered layered structure with reduced cation mixing.Carbon-enriched nanocrystalline LiFePO4 compounds were prepared by the sol-gel method and the R/F carbon gel method, respectively. A layer of carbon was laid down as a coating on the surface of the lithium crystals, which dramatically enhanced the electronic conductivity of the LiFePO4 compounds. A high capacity of 160 mAh/g at the C/5 rate has been demonstrated for the LiFePO4 electrode. These electrodes also exhibited good cyclability at different charge/discharge rates.A variety of anode materials have also been investigated to search out alternative anode materials to replace graphite for lithium ion batteries. Five types of cobalt oxides were prepared by high temperature decomposition, low temperature decomposition, high energy ball-milling, and the chemical decomposition of cobalt octacarbonyl in toluene, respectively. The LT-Co3O4, the CoO, and the nanosize Co3O4 powders prepared by decomposing organo-cobalt compounds at low temperature show good capacity retention on charge/discharge cycling, which is promising for their use as anode materials in Liion cells. It was found that the electrochemical properties of cobalt oxides are sensitive to the crystallinity, morphology, and particle size.Nanosize Ag powders were prepared via a reverse micelle approach. The size of Ag nanoparticles can be influenced by the concentration of the reduction agent. In addition, SnO2 nanopowders were synthesized by using the same method. 1D structured SnO2 nanorods were observed in the SnO2 nanopowders. The SnO2 nanopowder electrodes show high electrochemical reactivity toward lithium in Li-ion cells.The synthesized materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM, through which the phase composition and microstructure were observed. The capacity and cycle life of the cathode materials were obtained from charge/discharge cycling tests. The kinetic characteristics and kinetic parameters of lithium ion insertion and extraction within the electrode materials were determined by a.c. impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammograms.In summary, the investigations in this project have produced several types of electrode materials with high capacity and long cycle life. In particular, the study focuses on the preparation of cathode materials with high density and ordered structure, and anode materials with ultrafine particles. Analysis of the electrochemical processes in lithium ion cells was conducted by various techniques. All of these studies provide a fundamental basis for the development of high energy density electrode materials.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of the FMEA risk assessment technique to electronic health record systems</field><field name="creator">Win, Khin Than</field><field name="description">Patient safety and Medical errors are of growing concern in the health care industry. Some errors are caused by preventable adverse events; identifying potential errors and preventing them would mitigate risk and hence enhance the safety. Electronic health records (EHRs) are an inherent part of the healthcare systems and thus it is imperative that errors do not originate from EHRs. A thorough literature review indicated that no risk assessment methods currently exist for EHR systems. Project management risk and system security risk assessments do exist but not risk assessment of threats to safety. Accordingly, this research aims to develop a framework for the safety and dependability of EHRs, in order to analyse the risks associated with electronic health record systems. This research has identified a relationship of dependability and data quality of EHRs and attributes for the safety assessment of EHRs. The research involved (i) developing a theoretical basis of safety, based on dependability and data quality, (ii) defining the safety attributes of EHRs, (iii) identifying the risk assessment method applicable to EHRs, and (iv) conducting case studies of EHRs in different healthcare settings. A thorough understanding of EHRs is important to identify safety attributes of EHRs. Therefore, different EHRs, EHR systems around the world &#65533; their purposes, functionalities and information management - are all explored. This study investigated different available risk assessment methods and analysed them against different case scenarios to determine the appropriate risk assessment method for EHRs. After careful consideration, Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) was identified as an appropriate method for EHRs risk assessment. The idea and concept of risk assessment of EHRs were investigated by empirical studies on (i) the Community Health Information Management Enterprise (CHIME), Illawarra Area Health Service, and (ii) Maternal and Infant Network (MINET) database, South Western Sydney Area Health Service. Results from the case studies indicated that safety attributes identified from this research are appropriate for EHRs and that FMEA is indeed a suitable risk assessment method for EHRs. This study has verified by case studies that data availability, reliability and security are all important for safety. Potential systems risks- such as patient misidentification, security breaches due to initial password, and incorrect linkage of data were identified from this research and notified to the appropriate personnel such as system administrators and health care providers. Improvements to the systems in question have been achieved through modifications based on the results uncovered from these case studies. It can be concluded that the safety attributes identified from this research are essential for the safety of EHRs. It was also discovered that system quality is just as important, and therefore should be included in any safety assessment of electronic health record systems. It was further found that the safety cultures of organisations and healthcare providers are important in conducting risk assessment of EHRs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient topology control algorithms for ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Srivastava, Gaurav</field><field name="description">An Ad-hoc network is a collection of devices equipped with computing and wire- less communication capabilities, co-operating together to form a network. An ad-hoc node can communicate with other nodes within its transmission range, or use intermediate nodes to establish communication paths to nodes outside its transmission range. Intermediate nodes in a route can collaborate to act as routers and forward their own traffic as well as the traffic generated by other nodes in a network. This strategy of routing is different to wired networks were communication is made possible through specialised networking devices includ- ing hubs, switches and routers interconnecting Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The routers used in LANs and WANs are devices with large processing capabilities, and high speed communication links. The topology of a network consists of a set of links and nodes which are used to discover and maintain communication paths and assist in coordinating the flow of packets in a network. The topology information can be used for many purposes including evaluating the connectivity/bi-connectivity of a topology and construction of routing paths for network applications. Nodes generally rely on each other to acquire topology information. Topology information can be disseminated by one centralized node by using a specialised process known as &#8216;flooding&#8217; or can also be disseminated in a distributed manner by broadcasting partial link state information and generating local topology views. Such local views can be put together to generate a larger topology view of a network. Topology control is defined as a process where the topology of a network can be controlled by selective addition of nodes and links within a network. This process of selective addition can significantly impact the power usage and con- nectivity of network devices and improve longevity of a wireless network. In this thesis we analyse the impact of topology control and propose new algorithms and strategies that improve the connectivity, fault tolerance and communica- tion reliability of topology graphs. We review, classify, categorise existing lit- erature and discuss problems and issues associated with topology construction and maintenance proposed with and without Global Positioning System (GPS) aided techniques. Distributed topology control algorithms proposed for constructing minimum node degree graphs [Bettstetter, 2002] including K-Neigh [Blough et al., 2003], Location Information No Topology (LINT) [Ramanathan and Rosales-Hain, 2000], Location Information Link State Topology (LILT) [Ramanathan and Rosales-Hain, 2000] and MobileGrid (MG) [Liu and Li, 2002], do not necessarily generate bidirec- tional connected topology graphs and may result in isolated nodes and discon- nected clusters. Such isolated nodes and disconnected clusters affect the overall connectivity of a network. The bidirectional connectivity of a network is an im- portant factor in order to determine its performance. A &#8216;bidirectional connected&#8217; network, generally known as a connected network, is able to provide access to all crucial parts of a network and allows delivery of applications through a net- work. The bidirectional links are critical as they facilitate two way communica- tion between the transmitter and receiver nodes. We proposed two mechanisms, Collaborative Algorithm (CA) [Srivastava et al., 2004a] and Probable Critical Links (PCL) [Srivastava et al., 2004d] to improve the connectivity of minimum node degree graphs and analyse their performance [Srivastava et al., 2006].Power aware topology graphs use low power communications in order to reduce the overall power consumption of network nodes. A power optimised topology graph reduces the total number of links in the topology graph by eliminating long distance links and replacing them with a number of small links. Removing links in a network topology can impact the fault tolerance of a network. Fault tolerance of a network is the ability of a network to cope with link and node failures. We analyse the fault tolerance issues related to power aware topology graphs including Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) [Prim, 1957] and Relative Neighbourhood graphs (RNG) [Huang et al., 2002]. We propose Link Redun- dancy (LR) algorithm [Srivastava et al., 2005a] to improve the fault tolerance of topology control algorithms. We analyse the performance of LR through worked examples and simulations [Srivastava et al., 2005a]. The LR algorithms yields a higher fault tolerant topology as opposed to the distance based approaches where link selections are made on the basis of the separation distance and may not necessarily yield a higher degree of connectivity [Srivastava et al., 2005a]. Power control also allows nodes to improve the spatial reuse of a wireless channel by reducing interference on other network communications and allowing nodes to communicate simultaneously. We analyse the spatial reuse issues related to topology graphs which can limit the performance of the algorithms due to the presence of hidden nodes [Poon and Li, 2003]. We propose Distributed Range Assignment (DRA) algorithm [Srivastava et al., 2004b] to reduce the hidden nodes in a network topology. We and apply DRA to MST and RNG topology graphs and analyse their performance through worked examples and simulations [Srivastava et al., 2004b]. The distance based topology graphs including MST, RNG, K-Neigh, and CA- PCL [Srivastava et al., 2006] do not model obstacles in a network. The con- nectivity of distance based topology graphs can be severely limited due to the presence of obstacles as nodes alter transmission range on the basis of the sep- aration distance of links. Including signal attenuation characteristics can con- struct an accurate view of a network. We analyse the disconnected nature of distance based topology graphs under Lognormal-shadowing [Cox et al., 1984] [Cox et al., 1987] signal attenuation model. The Lognormal-shadowing model is used to analyse the impact of signal strength variations due to shadowing and scattering on the connectivity of power based topology graphs. We propose CA [Srivastava et al., 2006] in conjunction with the with power based topology graphs to improve the connectivity of a network [Srivastava et al., 2005b].</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to study protein conformation and protein-protein interactions</field><field name="creator">Watt, Stephen J.</field><field name="description">The polymerisation of a polypeptide chain from an encoded genetic sequence allows the formation of structured molecules, known as proteins. These are essential components for a range of processes including molecular recognition, DNA replication and enzymatic functions. In this thesis, the ability of electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) to be used as a tool to determine functional properties of proteins has been explored. The coupling of ESI-MS to hydrogen deuterium exchange has been used to show how restriction of the C- and N-termini by cyclization of the polypeptide backbone can affect the ability of a protein to sample unfolded or partially unfolded states. The development of appropriate methodologies for analysis of linear (uncyclized) and cyclized systems identified a slowing of the rate of unfolding due to cyclization. The implication for the unfolding processes of proteins are discussed. An increased thermal stability of the cyclized protein was also demonstrated. This property was used to analyse the ability of ESI-MS to identify changes in protein structure from shifts in ion distributions. Important observations regarding the polarity of ionization used in these experiments are highlighted. The effect opposite polarity ionization has on the ability to detect conformational changes in proteins and interactions with small ligands was explored using the well-characterized calmodulin-calcium-antipsychotic drug system. Important considerations regarding the binding of metal ions to protein structures are discussed in relation to the ability to unequivocally identify a conformational transition in protein structure from ESI mass spectra. An inability to detect complexes of calcium loadedcalmodulin with the antispychotic drug trifluroperazine in the negative ion mode was observed, a result believed to be due to the Coulombic repulsions between acidic residues of calmodulin. Finally, the non-covalent complex and interactions of the E. coli helicase (DnaB) were probed by nanoESI-MS and MS/MS studies. Development of suitable conditions allowed for identification of a previously unresolved heptamer in addition to the expected hexamer. The interaction of DnaB with its loading partner DnaC and the possible roles of ATP and ADP in this interaction were also probed with findings being related to the biological functions of these proteins.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the L-proline catalyzed and the borono Mannich reaction</field><field name="creator">Mao, Qin Yong</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the results of two independent research projects.  The first project is concerned with the synthesis of chiral 1,2-amino alcohols using an organocatalysed Mannich reaction. Chapter 1 gives an overview of L-proline catalysed Mannich reactions and describes the aims of this project.  Chapter 2 reports the results of this study. These reactions were found to be low yielding and poorly diastereoselective with the model compound propanal and did not work with the desired aldehyde O-benzylglycosaldehyde. The stereochemical outcomes of these reactions using NMR analysis were not certain. Future work would require X-ray crystallographic studies to confirm the product relative stereochemistries. This project was thus abandoned and a second project was studied. Chapter 3 provides an overview of cyclic N-acyliminium ion chemistry. Chapter 4 describes the results of a study of the borono-Mannich reaction on N-acyliminium ions, generated in situ from hemi-aminals derived from chiral 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-ones, to prepare substituted pyrrolidinones. The reactions of these N-acyliminium ions with boronic acids and other nucleophiles can afford the corresponding substituted pyrrolidinones diastereoselectively. The stereochemical assignments of these products were based on NMR coupling constants. X-ray structures of these compounds would be required in the future to confirm these assignments. The success of these reactions provided a possible strategy for the synthesis of functionalized pyrrolidinones and other potential glycosidases inhibitors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legislative implementation by Vietnam of its obligations under the United Nations Drug Control Conventions</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Hoa Phuong Thi</field><field name="description">Lying across many important traffic routes in South-East Asia and located within the proximity of the Golden Triangle, Vietnam has become an international transit point for illicit drugs. The availability of drugs smuggled from its neighbouring countries has brought about an alarming increase in drug abuse in the whole country, and especially among the youth. Having a tropical monsoon climate, it has also traditionally faced the problems of opium poppy cultivation and opium smoking among the ethnic populations in its mountainous and upland areas. In 1997, with the ratification of the three UN Drug Control Conventions,  Vietnam officially stepped into the international battle against illicit drugs. Becoming a Party to the Conventions, it came under obligations to bring domestic legislation into line with international standards. This Thesis examines, in-depth, the legal framework for drug control in Vietnam adopted in the years since it became a Party to the UN Drug Control Conventions. The Thesis first defines the obligations of Parties under these Conventions and then compares and analyzes strengths and weaknesses of Vietnamese legislation implementing the obligations. The contributions made by this Thesis to the field of drug control research are two-fold. First, it contributes a new understanding of Vietnamese successes and shortcomings in drug control laws that implement international obligations and identifies opportunities for improvement of the national drug control legal framework. Secondly, the success of international drug control mechanisms depends heavily on implementation by the individual contracting Parties. Yet state implementation in accordance with national legislation and institution capabilities varies considerably. This case study of Vietnamese implementation is useful for furthering understanding of the transformation of drug control international standards into national law, especially in developing countries having similar legal, social and economic features, such as are found in Indo-China.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The status of the greater glider "Petauroides volans" in the Illawarra region</field><field name="creator">Maloney, Kevin S</field><field name="description">Anecdotal evidence suggested that the Greater glider Petauroides volans Kerr 1792 had been eliminated from Royal National Park by wildfires in 1994. This thesis is concerned with the distribution of the Greater glider in the Illawarra region, the reasons why it appears unable to recolonise an area in which it was formerly found, and the potential for re-establishing the former population. The specific aims of this study were to (1) clarify the taxonomy of this species; (2) review the distribution and abundance of Greater gliders in the Illawarra area and the current threats to populations; (3) conduct a detailed field study in the region; and (4) develop a translocation proposal for reintroduction of Greater gliders to Royal National Park.Early accounts of the Greater glider Petauroides volans (Marsupialia: Pseudocheiridae), started with Arthur Phillips&#8217; 1789 account in The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay, but, since then, the species has had a quite peripatetic and confusing taxonomic history. It has been listed as a member of 10 genera, with about 23 different binomial names. The taxonomy and early descriptions of the species&#8217; morphology, dentition, behaviour, distribution and abundance are complex, and P. volans has frequently been confused with a number of other gliding possums, particularly the Yellow-bellied glider, Petaurus australis. Early descriptions of the morphology of P. volans were given only in broad general terms. More value can be placed on the early behavioural observations, and on the earliest records of their occurrence. Recent distribution records of the Greater glider in the study area show that its range and numbers have declined over a 35 year period. Many factors may have contributed to this decline including; removal of habitat and den trees, predators, and the timing and frequency of fire events. The population of Greater gliders that was present at Royal National Park prior to 1994 was depleted by the shooting of 21 individuals between 1978 to 1980. A number of barriers in the landscape will limit the ability of the Greater glider to disperse from adjacent areas back to Royal National Park.My detailed field study, using spotlighting, at 19 sites confirmed that it is no longer present in many areas in which it was once observed. It is present in areas that are conserved as part of Sydney catchment Authority, and is indeed absent from Royal National Park. This information suggests that a reintroduction of the Greater glider to Royal National Park would be worthwhile, particularly as the Greater glider was formerly abundant at Royal National Park.The biological and ecological factors required by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service policy document for the translocation of fauna are considered for the translocation proposal of the Greater glider to Royal National Park. These factors include; the reintroduction of 18 individuals using a sex ratio of 1:2 (6 males and 12 females), at two sites (Jersey Springs and Bola Creek) with three lots of F-M-F at each site (3 males and 6 females). Monitoring of the translocated individuals would use radio collars, reflective tags and spotlighting to determine initial success of the reintroduction. The low population numbers of the Greater glider in the Illawarra region call for sourcing the individuals from other areas. The taxonomy and the current and former range of the Greater glider are reviewed.The Greater glider lives for 10 &#8211; 15 years with adult females having one young per year, with greater success in forests with higher nutrient levels. The species is solitary and virtually silent, with populations ranging from 0.01 to 5 individuals per hectare. It is a hollow dependent, nocturnal folivorous marsupial which feeds high in the canopy and consumes some 33 eucalypt and ten non eucalypt species across its distribution. The home range size for the Greater glider is 1.4 to 2.6 ha for males and 0.8 to 2.5 ha for females. Threats to this species include habitat clearing, logging, fire and predation with ten predators reported. The only disease reported is Chlamydia which appears not to have any effect, while three ectoparasites and eight endoparasites were also recorded for this species. There have been no previous translocation programs undertaken for the Greater glider; other analogous species which have been translocated include the Sugar glider, Koala and Common Brushtail possum.The source population for the translocation of the Greater glider to Royal National Park, should come from an area other than the Illawarra as these populations are in low numbers and are of local conservation priority.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi network and business performance of Sino-Thai SMEs</field><field name="creator">Sahakijpicharn, Krittakorn</field><field name="description">During the last few decades overseas Chinese business networks have been important for the local economies of many countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand. Although only 14 percent of the Thai population is Sino-Thai, they still make a significant contribution to the Thai economy. Sino-Thais are estimated to control over 80 percent of listed companies by market capitalisation (Mackie, 1994). One of the key factors behind the success of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and in other countries, is strong social relationships and strong business networks between them. A number of studies have attempted to explain how these social relationships and business networks contribute to Chinese business success. A clear picture of such a connection has, however, still not been achieved. Thus, the main object of this thesis is to examine how social relationships can be used to improve business performance, in particular for the case of Sino-Thai SMEs.To attain this objective, this thesis first reviews the literature relating to both guanxi and organisation networks. Evidence from the literature shows the importance and benefits that both guanxi and organisational networks can provide to its members. In addition, this thesis also reviews the literature relating to strength of ties, network embeddedness, business uncertainty and business performance. By reviewing the literature a theoretical framework, that links these factors together, can be established. From the framework a number of assumptions and hypotheses relating to relationships between the guanxi network, strength of ties, network embeddedness, business uncertainty, and business performance are identified. The Kruskal-Wallis Test, a multiple regression analysis, a multiple discriminant analysis, and factor analysis are all used to test these assumptions and hypotheses. Data from 298 Bangkok based Sino-Thai SMEs provide a number of interesting results. First, strength of ties in the network for the family relationship is stronger than the friend and stranger relationship, while the strength of ties in the network for the friend relationship is stronger than the stranger relationship. Second, strength of ties in the network has a positive impact on the level of network embeddedness. Third, the level of network embeddedness for the family relationship is stronger than that for the friend and stranger relationship, while the level of network embeddedness for the friend relationship is stronger than the stranger relationship. Fourth, network embeddedness has a positive impact on Sino-Thai SMEs&#8217; business performance. Fifth, business uncertainties have a negative effect on Sino-Thai SMEs&#8217; business performance and sixth strength of ties in the network has a negative effect on business uncertainties. This thesis also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) as a means to analyse all variables in the framework simultaneously, and to confirm results of hypotheses testing presented earlier. The result of SEM provides strong support for the empirical findings in this thesis and, also, suggests that network embeddedness is the most important factor that helps to improve business performance as a result of an increase in the strength of ties in the network. Finally, this thesis recommends that policy-makers should encourage SMEs to consider both formal and informal networks as presenting real opportunities to increase their business performance. In particular, policy-makers can encourage and help Sino-Thais SMEs to use the common characteristics of the guanxi network to establish strong business networks with other Chinese entrepreneurs in other countries such as   Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and China. Furthermore, this thesis suggests financial risk management and changes in firm strategy as two major approaches that SEMs can use to reduce some business uncertainties.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleation and growth of 55% Al-Zn alloy on steel substrate</field><field name="creator">Xu, Bao Jiang</field><field name="description">The nature of nucleation and growth of the alloy overlay of a 55%A1-Zn alloy on a steel substrate strongly affects the surface appearance of hot dip metal-coated steel in the Zincalume process. The potential nucleation site of the first nucleus that forms in the alloy overlay will contribute to the initial solidification process and subsequent microstructural development. An important issue of industrial interest is the occurrence of localized variations in spangle size or variations in spangle size from coil to coil. Control of spangle size on hot-dip metallic coatings is important both from an aesthetic and functional point of view. From the point of view of surface appearance, a uniform spangle size is required and small spangle size is required for improvement of tension bend rust stain performance. An attempt was made to reveal the nature of nucleation and growth of the A1-Zn overlay by studying early stage nucleation and growth. The effect of cooling rate on spangle formation, the influence of trace element additions, the effects of dipping time, preheat temperature and bath composition were taken into account during experimental immersion tests. Spangle size, dendrite arm spacing and solidification temperature of the alloy overlay were determined under various cooling conditions and a variety of other techniques were used to analyze the progress of solidification.Experiments were conducted in the current study to determine the influence of process variables on spangle size. An experimental immersion simulator was used to test the hypothesis regarding nucleation on intermetallic particles using a quench-interruption technique. Serial sectioning in combination with microprobe studies has been used to quantify the element distribution. Commercial products have been analyzed using a tilt polishing technique combined with EPMA to assess element distribution across the solidified overlay. Also, bulk analysis of the element distribution through the thickness of commercial products has been conducted using Glow Discharge Spectroscopy. These experimental studies provided convincing experimental evidence that 55%A1-Zn spangles nucleate on the intermetallic layer. In an attempt to verify that the experimental observations are scientifically founded, a model was developed to predict the nucleation rate and nucleation temperature. Thermodynamic analyses as well as phase-field modeling have been used to further correlate the experimental findings with theoretical predictions. The rate of nucleation decreases with an increase in wetting angle, and the nucleation temperature decreases with increasing cooling rate. Phase field modeling predicts that an aluminum rich phase forms at the intermetallic layer, acting as the nucleus of a spangle.Experimental studies on spangle size distribution of 55%A1-Zn have indicated that the cooling rate and bath composition are factors that influence spangle size. An attempt to prove that experimental observations are scientifically forwarded, modeling of nucleation rate, nucleation temperature, thermodynamic analysis as well as phase-field modeling have been conducted. An advantage of the modeling techniques is that the rate of nucleation and nucleation temperature as function of undercooling and cooling rate can be extrapolated beyond the experimental findings. A description of heterogeneous nucleation was modeled to elucidate the effect of cooling rate on the rate of nucleation and nucleation temperature. The rate of nucleation decreases with an increase of wetting angle, and the nucleation temperature decreases with increasing the cooling rate, also the microstructural evolution at different nucleation sites during solidification of 55%A1-Zn coating is simulated using a phase-field model. A comparison of this experimental observation with the phase field simulations reveals good correlation with the case where dendrite growth was initiated at the intermetallic layer. Detail examination and thermodynamic analysis explained the occurrence of the different intermetallic phases on the alloy layer that could provide potent nucleation sites and hence lead to variation of spangle size. Consideration of nature of nucleation and growth of 55%A1-Zn alloy on steel substrate was taken to clarify the variation of spangle size. In combination with modified immersion simulator and various measuring techniques and modeling approaches, it concluded that the intermetallic layer is potent nucleation site and results in spangle size variation, also the cooling rate and trace elements play role in the spangle size.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/72</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of social identities and individual differences in predicting prejudice: a plea for tolerance</field><field name="creator">Leeson, Peter Richard Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the need for greater integration between individual difference and group-based explanations of prejudice. It began by addressing the claim of many self categorisation theorists that any attempt at integration is doomed, because individual differences play little role in predicting intergroup behaviour when a person's social identity is salient (Turner, 1982). Contrary to this prediction, both Study One and Two showed that even when participant's social identities were salient, individual difference variables correlated with prejudice. Study Two went on to illustrate the dynamic nature of individual differences. It demonstrated that the relationship between ingroup belonging, intergroup prejudice, and the sub-scales of the Personal Need for Structure measure differed depending on the situational context. Finally, contrary to self categorisation theory, it was found that Australian identity was unrelated to prejudice.This led to the second question at the heart of the thesis, do all individuals identify with their group in the same way; are the images, stereotypes, and norms of a national group held universally, or even widely? In Study Three, participants generated attributes they believed typical of the average Australian. These responses were content analysed by independent raters, producing a final list of 27 attributes. An examination of this list revealed a broad range of, often, contradictory auto-stereotypes. These attributes were then presented to a separate sample of participants in Study Four. A factor analysis produced three distinct, if inter-related, stereotype components: 'positive in group regard', 'traditional Australian', and open-minded/independent. These auto-stereotype components were, in tum, differentially related to participants' value orientation, as measured by Braithwaite and Law's (1985) social values inventory. Thus, compared to moral relativists, dualists were significantly more likely to depict Australians using attributes from each of the stereotype components, with the security orientated scoring significantly higher than moral relativists on both the 'positive ingroup regard' and 'traditional Australian' components. Study Five examined the relationship between Social Comparison Orientation (SCO) and perception of group belonging. Reflecting a pattern similar to that of Study Two, the correlation between SCO and perceptions of both the ingroup and outgroup differed depending on situational context. The combined results of these studies point to the need to re-examine the importance of individual differences when considering the relationship between social identity and prejudice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensors and actuators for the cochlear implant using inherently conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Wu, Yanzhe</field><field name="description">This study considered the use of various inherently conducting polymer (ICP)-based devices for utilisation with the cochlear implant. Investigations centred on the use of polypyrrole (PPy) to produce a mechanical sensor, actuators and controlled release devices. The development of a novel force sensor using the electrodes that are an integrated part of the cochlear implant itself was also investigated.Investigation into mechanically induce electrical signals using PPybased mechanical sensors showed that the polarity of the voltage output was dependent on the dopant ion in the conducting polymer. In addition, it was found that the signal amplitude was related to the redox state of the PPy and the concentration of mobile dopant ions within the PPy. This led to the &#8220;stress induced ion flux&#8221; mechanism being proposed for the first time to explain such observations.Actuator systems developed in this study included a PPy trilayer bending actuator, a PPy microfluidic pump and a PPy-coated hollow fibre. The study of PPy trilayer actuators led to several findings including a high amplitude harmonic vibration using a PPy/TFSI trilayer actuator, the first time that such behaviour has been observed for ICP-based mechanical actuators. A study of the blocking forces generated using such actuators in ionic liquid electrolytes suggested that switching from cathodic contraction to cathodic expansion occurs under the application of reducing potentials. This switching behaviour was found to depend on the amplitude and time of the electrochemical stimulation employed. It was shown that the expulsion of the dopant anion (PF6-) from the reduced polymer (- 0.8 V vs. Ag/Ag+) did not support the previously claimed cathodic expansion model. An ion diffusion controlled mechanism was proposed to explain the results obtained.Investigations into the novel &#8220;tube in tube actuator nodule&#8221; (TITAN) microfluidic pump based on PPy had led to the significant finding that, for the first time, the intrinsic resistance of PPy can be utilised to carry out peristaltic actuation for the purpose of fluid transport.The electrochemically controlled release of a model anion from the internal volume of a PPy-coated platinised PVDF hollow fibre was successfully demonstrated. Such controlled release was ascribed to the electrochemically activated incorporation / expulsion of small anions upon redox switching of polypyrrole resulting in enhanced ion transport across the concentration gradient from the internal volume of the hollow fibre to the receiving solution. The experimental findings suggested that electrochemically controlled release of anionic drugs is a real possibility using a device configuration consisting of a reservoir coated with an ICP membrane.By studying the electrochemical impedance changes in response to impact forces on the tip of a cochlear implant in artificial perilymph solution, it was found that the cochlear implant electrode itself can be used to detect impact forces. The findings were significant because such an approach provides a simple and safe method for the detection of possible dangers during surgical implantation of the cochlear implant. Factors influencing the response were investigated and these included solution composition and the orientation of the impact forces encountered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Food Synergies: improving the effect of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid on cardiovascular disease risk factors through concurrent dietary consumption of canola or soy isoflavones</field><field name="creator">Ridges, Leisa</field><field name="description">Ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are among the leading causes of death in Australian men and women with heart diseases being the third highest cause of death in Australian women and fourth highest cause of death in Australian men (AIHW, 2006). In Australia more than 50% of all adults have two or three (out of a possible nine) risk factors for cardiovascular disease and 15% having four or more risk factors. It has long been recognised that diet modification can reduce these risks. Recently dietary advice has moved from an &#8220;exclusionary&#8221; to an &#8220;inclusionary&#8221; paradigm. That is, rather than identify dietary items to avoid, current guidelines recommend incorporating advice to increase the consumption of a range of functional foods including marine sourced omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA and vegetable oils.  EPA and DHA are effective functional foods in reducing CVD mortality, cardiac death, sudden death and myocardial infarction. EPA and DHA provide this cardiovascular benefit by improving several risk factors including: fasting plasma triglycerides, blood pressure and arterial compliance. However, a safety concern of dietary EPA and DHA supplementation is their capacity to cause a significant increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations. Dietary intake levels of EPA and DHA in the Australian diet are well below those associated with reductions in CVD risk. In 50% of the population a potential 20 &#8211; fold increase in EPA and DHA would be required to increase intake levels to those commensurate with reduced CVD risk. While dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA is one means of increasing dietary intake levels, strategies to increase the efficacy of EPA and DHA would also be advantageous and could reduce supplement doses. Dietary strategies that could simultaneously counteract the rise in LDL cholesterol caused by DHA would also be beneficial. The research described in this thesis aimed to modify the bioavailability and cardiovascular effects of DHA by modifying other dietary factors and combining DHA with other active ingredients. To address these aims two human clinical trials were conducted. The first examined the effect of altering the types of oil and margarine consumed in the diet with view to reducing the dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids while supplementing the diet with DHA-rich fish oil (MOFO study). This study showed that replacing usual dietary oil and margarine with canola products while supplementing the diet with 1.1g/d of DHA favourably improved total omega-3 fatty acid incorporation and reduced the omega-6: omega-3 fatty acid ratio in plasma and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids as effectively as double the supplement dose of DHA. Additionally, there was a similar rise in erythrocyte membrane and plasma DHA when either safflower or sunola oil, which contain very different amounts of linoleic acid, were consumed concurrently with a daily dietary supplementation of 1.1g/d of DHA. A distinguishing feature of canola is its relatively high omega-3 ALA content. Thus, these findings add to the body of scientific evidence supporting the view that the total amount of dietary omega-3 consumed has greater impact on the bioavailability of supplemented DHA than the ratio of dietary omega-6: omega-3 fatty acids. The MOFO study also showed that the combination of canola plus 1.1g/d of DHA is equally as effective as daily supplementation with 2.2g/d of DHA at reducing fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations with the added benefit of preventing the significant rise in both LDL and total cholesterol caused by both doses of DHA alone. While further research is warranted based on the findings from animal studies, it can reasonably be proposed that the findings from the MOFO study may be an example of a synergistic effect of canola phytosterols and DHA, rather than ALA and DHA, working together to significantly reduce fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations while preventing detrimental effects on LDL cholesterol in people with mild hypertriglyceridemia. The second human clinical trial conducted as part of this thesis examined the effect of combining omega-3 fatty acids with soy isoflavones on fasting blood lipids, blood pressure and arterial compliance (Omega-Soy study). The Omega-Soy study showed that the combined consumption of DHA with soy isoflavones resulted in an 8-10% improvement in HDL cholesterol, an 18-20% reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations and the absence of a 10.8% rise in LDL cholesterol observed with DHA supplementation alone. Furthermore, the increases in LDL and total cholesterol observed with DHA supplementation in the first six weeks were reversed and significantly reduced when soy cereal was concurrently consumed. The results showed that the dietary combination of soy isoflavones and DHA improve the lipid profile of moderately hyperlipidemic individuals more favourably than either constituent alone. While further research is warranted based on evidence from in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models demonstrating functional effects of soy isoflavones and DHA on lipid metabolism pathways, it can reasonably be proposed that the findings from the Omega-Soy study demonstrate a synergistic effect of soy isoflavones and DHA, working together to significantly reduce fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations without detrimental  effects on LDL cholesterol in people with mild hyperlipidemia. The findings from this thesis support two functional food synergies for effective improvement of blood lipid concentrations when consumed as part of the usual diet of men and postmenopausal women with moderately elevated blood lipids. These functional food combinations are DHA with canola and DHA with soy isoflavones. The findings of this thesis sheds some light on how isoflavones may be actively involved in reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations when consumed with soy protein or in soy containing foods, furthermore the findings of this thesis provide strategies for ultimately reducing the negative side effects of dietary DHA supplementation and for achieving a better outcome in overall lipid profile improvements than could be achieved with DHA supplementation alone. Future research into these synergistic combinations of functional food ingredients with DHA may lead to new directions in functional food development by food manufacturers to enable more consumers to manage their blood lipid concentrations with minimal or without drug therapy requirements.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tell Me a Story</field><field name="creator">Kyriacos, Nicholas</field><field name="description">Tell Me A Story (TMAS) is comprised of an exploration into the lives of a number of people who live in the Sydney suburb of Redfern in the late twentieth century. Both the suburb and the seven major characters are intended to be seen as a microcosm of contemporary Australian life: the characters vary in age, ethnicity, sex and educational background. The life of each was initially intended to show the relevance of place, institutions and story-telling to our need of belonging. With each subsequent redraft, the importance of our past became more prominent: its impact on our present reality became, in time, the major concern of TMAS. The hybridised structure and form of my novel draw on the stories these characters tell each other as well as the narrated stories of their own lives, seen in flashbacks. Such tales interweave, addressing such fundamental questions as what, how and why we develop a connectedness to people, place and time. Such a multi-layered exploration of the characters&#65533; memories, whether they inhabit a real or imagined landscape, is seen in the fragmented narrative of their lives, combining to show the influence of the past on the present. This is shown most powerfully in the lives of the Aboriginal characters. In documenting their past lives against the reality of their contemporary world, an intricate weaving of what was and what is, is explored. TMAS argues not only that one must attempt to make sense of the present by coming to an understanding of the past, but also that our past manifests itself in ways we are not always conscious of, and concludes with the idea, as seen through the eyes of Johnnie Butler, that There&#65533;s no straight line in time, as your teacher&#65533;d once told you, making a neat beginning, middle and unfolding future. You see the past returning repeatedly in great undulating circles, neverending swirls expanding constantly to encompass the story of your life and of those who&#65533;ve come before you, and of those not yet born. Such an idea manifests an ongoing and deep personal interest. For this reason my exegesis begins with elements of my own life. The exegesis itself is a story of sorts, analysing my own journey through the many drafts of TMAS. It argues that the hybridised structure &#65533; involving first, second and third person narratives, diary entries, contemporary idiom and slang &#65533; is a suitable form through which to explore the pattern of experience of my Australian characters. To give integrity to such lives, a wide range of sources was used. Research involved personal interviews, videos, CDs, newspapers and magazines, all of which complemented traditional scholarly research into the lives of the Redfern inhabitants of Greek, Lebanese, indigenous and Irish-Catholic ethnicity, whose ages range from nine to 99 years of age. In the extensive redrafting, the writing was as experimental as it was imaginative.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inverse model of ultrasonic echolocation</field><field name="creator">Tsakiris, Janos</field><field name="description">Object recognition systems based on ultrasonic sensing have significant drawbacks in generality, resolution and speed. The objective of our research was the development of more efficient technique(s) for ultrasonic based object recognition through the investigation of models of acoustic backscatter, with particular emphasis on the work of Albert Freedman. The &#65533;image pulse&#65533; model developed by Freedman calculates the echoes generated from convex objects in an underwater environment after insonification with a narrowband transient signal. The primary prediction of this model is that echoes are generated at those points along a scattering body where there are step discontinuities in the derivatives, with respect to range, of the solid angle subtended at the transducer by the scatterer, the amplitudes of the echoes being a linear combination of the magnitudes of said discontinuities. We extended this model for use in an air environment using non-coincident transmitters and receivers and conducted experiments to measure the amplitudes of the echoes from a range of radially symmetric convex objects, at distances up to 1.4m, after insonification with a Polaroid transducer. These amplitudes were compared to those predicted by the model, with the results for the cones highlighting the limitations of the theory at modelling the echoes from the geometrical shadow boundaries of objects. The results for the spherical objects were significantly better however, with an average error of less than 5%, suggesting that the model should be reasonably accurate at calculating the echoes from convex objects with smoothly varying surfaces. The extended forward model was then inverted to produce an inverse model that would calculate the geometrical parameters of a radially symmetric scattering body from an analysis of the echoes received after insonification of these bodies with ultrasonic pulses at two discrete frequencies. A quantitative verification of this inverse model with various scattering bodies proved elusive, with a low correlation between experiment and theory, due to matrix instability and difficulties in obtaining data of sufficient accuracy. However, qualitative trends in the data indicate that the model is essentially correct, though very sensitive to measurement precision and media characteristics, and there is good reason to believe that further work under more controlled laboratory conditions and/or a different medium would verify the model&#65533;s validity quantitatively. Finally, the inverse model was tested to see whether it could find a practical application despite its quantitative limitations. In many industries, quality control involves distinguishing between those items that are physically damaged and those that are not, a task that the inverse model may be able to address. Using glass bulbs as the test subjects, some with simulated physical damage and some without, we tested the ability of the inverse model to distinguish between these two classes of objects. In all cases, the model clearly separated the items with simulated damage from those without. The inverse model should be of interest to workers in the field of industrial quality control because of its potential to lead to the development of real-time inspection systems for production lines that could perform with a higher efficiency than the visual inspection procedures currently being employed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical analysis of financially distressed Australian companies: the application of survival analysis</field><field name="creator">Chancharat, Nongnit</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an empirical analysis of financially distressed companies in the Australian context using survival analysis techniques. Three main assays are developed and presented in the thesis. The first assay explores the effect of financial ratios and other variables on corporate financial distress and identifies the probability of corporate survival in a given time frame. The four main categories of financial ratios are profitability, liquidity, leverage and activity ratios and control variables which are a market-based variable and company-specific variables; for example, company age, company size and squared size are employed in the analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was estimated using time-varying variables based on a sample of 1,117 publicly listed Australian companies over the period 1989 to 2005. Empirical results found that financially distressed companies have higher leverage measured by debt ratio, lower past excess returns and larger size compared to active companies. Researchers argue that a company may exit the market in several different ways, such as through merger, acquisition, voluntary liquidation and bankruptcy and each type of exit is likely to be affected by different factors. Consequently, the second assay investigates the determinants of multiple states of financial distress by applying a competing risks Cox proportional hazards model. The unordered three-state financial distress model is defined as follows: state 0: active companies, state 1: distressed external administration companies and state 2: distressed takeover, merger or acquisition companies. The effect of financial ratios, market-based variable and company-specific variables including company age, company size and squared size on three different states of corporate financial distress are investigated based on a sample of 1,081 publicly listed Australian companies over the period 1989 to 2005. The results indicate that it is important to distinguish between the different financial distress states. Additionally, the results suggest that distressed external administration companies have higher leverage, lower past excess returns and a larger size while distressed takeover, merger or acquisition companies have lower leverage, higher capital utilization efficiency and a bigger size compared to active companies. In addition to examining financial ratios as the main variables, this thesis further explores the effect of corporate governance attributes on IPO companies&#8217; survival focusing on a particular sector. Accordingly, the third assay examines the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on the survival of 127 new economy IPO companies listed on the ASX between 1994 and 2002. In addition to the three main categories of corporate governance attributes include board size, board independence and ownership concentration; control variables, for example, offering characteristics, financial ratios and company-specific variables, are also included in the model. The Cox proportional hazards model estimation results found ownership concentration significantly negative related to the survival of new economy IPO companies. For offering characteristics variables, the offering size and the underwriter backing are a significant variable in explaining IPO companies&#8217; survival; however, the estimated signs are in contrast to the expectations. Specifically, those IPO companies with a larger offering size are less likely to survive than are those that offer a smaller size. Furthermore, the results found that the hazard of financial distress for companies with an offer that is underwritten is greater than the hazard for those for which the offer is not underwritten. For financial ratios, the results indicate that the debt ratio is statistically significant in explaining IPO firms&#8217; survival. In particular, IPO companies with a low total debts to total assets ratio are less likely to fail.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The National Times: bastard of a paper'</field><field name="creator">Amos, Jessica</field><field name="description">'Bastard of a Paper' is a political  documentary script which is supported by a thesis. It contends that 'the public right to know' requires more support against political expediency. The script depicts the conflict between 'hard-nosed' investigative journalists at the National Times/Times on Sunday and the NSW state and federal governments during the 1980s - an era renowned for its investigative reporting. Institutionalised corruption, which had been tolerated by previous governments despite numerous royal commissions on related issues, was the most contentious issue. The script implicates the ensuing political pressure - to sideline media investigation into corruption - in the demise of the National Times evident in the closure of the Times on Sunday. The thesis, which is the second part of this work, contains the research which determines the construction of the script. The early part of the script establishes that the National Times's adversarial reporting originated in part from the 'era of dissent'. The 1960s and 1970s influenced the relationship between politicians, journalists and the public in favour of 'watchdog' journalism. In the script, the National Times team of journalists share a sense of egalitarianism. Their strong reporting was also due to the relative editorial independence at John Fairfax Limited especially after 1978 when James Fairfax replaced Sir Warwick Fairfax as Chairperson. However, also at this time, the newly elected Wran state government was intent on ensuring the support of big business and especially the media. This agenda was a response to the fall of the Whitlam Federal Labor government in 1975 and the press's history of generally supporting Liberal governments. The Federal Labor government elected in 1983 also pursued unprecedented close relationships with big business which the National Times and the Times on Sunday criticised. The Hawke government's favourable treatment of Fairfax's competitorRupert Murdoch's company News Corporation -led in part to Fairfax's near dissolution and the context in which the Times on Sunday closed. This context was prohibitive for any journalism except that which was friendly to the political establishment which was then the right wing of the Labor Party otherwise known as 'the machine' . The thesis and the script establish that the corruption alleged in National Times stories warranted such 'hard-nosed journalism'. Long-standing practices such as extortion had become institutionalised during the Vietnam War when Kings Cross was a popular 'rest and recreation' destination. Drug trafficking particularly of heroin led to unforeseen profits which were laundered through gambling. Its impact on society eroded traditional tolerance of corruption which had evolved from unenforceable laws. Whistle blowers and reform minded politicians began demanding reform, especially after the corruption related murders of community figures such as Donald Mackay and Juanita Nielsen during the 1970s. By the 1980s, the National Times was far from alone in calling for reform. However, the Wran government was reluctant to initiate reform; the NSW Police Force being one example The traditional 'talking heads' documentary format makes the National Times 'team' of journalists - the main focus. This structure expresses that events described in the script arose out of circumstances just as much if not more so than individuals. Moreover, integration of this traditional form with fiction film motifs for example foregrounds the script's construction rather than the techniques of cinema verite or docu-auteurs which efface their own manipulation of events. The dialogue in 'Bastard of a Paper' is sourced from previously published material, archival footage and to a lesser extent from three personal interviews with former National Times journalists - David Rickie, Wendy Bacon and Evan Whitton. The sources for all dialogue in the script are cited in Chapter Three of the thesis and its footnotes. With few exceptions, the dialogue in the script is from previously published sources.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quaternary palaeochannel evolution and groundwater movement in the Coleambally Irrigation District of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Pucillo, Kevin</field><field name="description">The Quaternary alluvial and aeolian sediments underlying the eastern portion of the Riverine Plain have been examined to assess their impact on groundwater access and movement in the Coleambally district. Over 9800 borehole logs from the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) and surrounding districts were digitized using GIS and database software and supplemented with 632 borehole logs from the Department of Land and Water Conservation (Leeton) to form the platform for stratigraphic and groundwater investigations conducted in this study. The borehole data were summarised into two sediment classification schemes, the first to delineate the distribution of palaeochannel sediments and the second to assess to spatial distribution of aquitards and aquifers. A series of detailed cross-sections differentiated between at least four distinct palaeochannel sequences identified within the Upper Shepparton Formation overlying the clay-dominated Lower Shepparton Formation. The two deepest sequences, the new Gumblebogie and Ugobit members, comprise thick (3-10 m), laterally extensive (up to 25 km wide) sheets of coarse sandy alluvium that occur to the north of the CIA at depths between 12 to 35 metres below the surface. These deposits are evidence of highly active alluvial phases on the plain, more vigorous than any since. Slightly higher in the sequence (typically 10-20 m depth) is a thick (2-15 m), laterally extensive (up to 10 km wide) mixed-load sequence (the new Duderbang member), which is stratigraphically disconnected from the deeper sanddominated units. Near-surface palaeochannel deposits, which consist of less extensive (up to 3 km wide) coarse sandy alluvium at depth and a combination of mixed- and bedload sequences closer to the surface, make up the youngest palaeochannel deposits in the area. The size and extent of reserved palaeochannel sequences beneath the study area have decreased markedly since what is interpreted as the mid Quaternary and is probably symptomatic of declining fluvial activity on the Riverine Plain through to the present. The development of source-bordering dunes associated with belts of palaeochannel material in the area was examined using shallow geophysics (GPR), topographic surveys, laser particle size analysis and thermoluminescence dating. Dune building in Contents the area occurred in conjunction with channel activity during the Kerarbury (55-35 ka) and Coleambally (105-80 ka) palaeochannel phases (Page et al., 1996) when sediment supply conditions were favourable, probably due to strongly seasonal discharges draining the southeastern highlands. The presence of stabilising vegetation on the channel margins is believed to have played a key role in the development of dunes in the area, which show poorly developed internal structure. The increased precipitation that enhanced channel discharges must also have sustained dune vegetation. Increased aridity and reduced vegetation approaching and during the LGM appears to have caused the widespread remobilization of dune crests. The complex alluvial and aeolian stratigraphy of the Shepparton Formation strongly influences groundwater movement in the Coleambally district. Piezometric levels show that deeper, highly permeable units (e.g. Ugobit member) in the northern part of the study area act as conduits for the discharge of groundwater, helping to maintain much lower watertables in the north as well as induce groundwater flow from the CIA. &#8216;Sediment vs depth&#8217; analysis demonstrates that there is limited vertical connection through the thick, clay-dominated sequence of the Lower Shepparton Formation to the highly transmissive sands and gravels of the underlying Calivil Formation. The tendency of the Lower Shepparton Formation to restrict downward leakage is likely to both contribute to the problem of shallow irrigation-induced watertables in the CIA as well as impede efforts to lower watertables by pumping from deeper aquifers. The upper 3 metres of the Shepparton Formation are clay-dominated with a low water storage capacity, causing near-surface watertables to be highly responsive to recharge by surface water. The available data indicate that when piezometric levels fall below this clay-rich zone they are able to absorb short-term increases in recharge due to the higher proportion permeable alluvium in the unsaturated zone.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbulent plumes generated by a horizontal area source of buoyancy</field><field name="creator">Chaengbamrung, Apichart</field><field name="description">Plumes generated from hot surfaces may contain fumes and other contaminants that constitute major health and environmental hazards. Current design techniques of contaminated plume control for area sources of heat have limited applicability, and provide little information on plume characteristics such as vertical velocity distribution, density distribution, etc. in the zone near the source.This study is an experimental and computational (CFD) investigation into the fundamental processes of plume generation and dispersion from a hot area source, such as a hot metal bath, blast furnaces etc. The main aims are to provide quantitative data and theoretical models that will enable engineers/designers to greatly improve the efficiency of exhaust systems and reduce exposure of workers and the community to harmful contaminants.The main aim of this project was to conduct a fundamental investigation into the complex processes of plume generation from a hot surface of finite size and its subsequent dispersion. Particular objectives included: 1. Use of experimental techniques to investigate plume characteristics such as velocity and density/temperature fields. 2. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of velocity and temperature fields. 3. Validation of the CFD simulations, using analytical solutions and specific experiments of increasing complexity.The experimental work was conducted in two distinct programs. In the first part, saline plumes generated from a uniform area source descending into quiescent water were studied. This represented a &#8216;cold flow&#8217; analogy of thermal plumes ascending in quiescent air. A 1.4m cubed environmental tank was designed, built and commissioned in which experiments were carried out. Experiments are described in which the velocity and salt concentration profiles in the plume were measured. Two-dimensional velocity profiles were determined using a PTV (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) technique. The plume shape was recorded on video tape and also analysed using the DigImage PTV analysis software. A special conductivity probe with digital position control was used to measure the concentration of salt solution (or plume density distribution) both inside and outside the plume at different levels within a 1.4m cubed environmental tank. In the CFD simulations, two geometries were used to determine plume characteristics and were compared with experimental results.In the second program, thermal plumes generated from a uniform temperature area source were investigated inside a glass enclosure. Both vertical and horizontal velocity profiles were measured using the LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) technique. Fine thermocouples were used to measure the temperature distribution of in the plume inside the enclosure. CFD analysis of confined and unconfined thermal plumes was carried out.Saline plume experiments showed that the plume flow from an area source can be modelled as two regions, one from the area source to the plume neck and the second region beyond the neck. The saline plume radius was measured using the Shadowgraph and the Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique. The plume radius determined by the Shadowgraph technique and image analysis was greater than the plume radius determined by the vertical velocity analysis by approximately 50%.It was found that the Gaussian equation is suitable as a model of the vertical velocity and density distributions where the plume reaches the self-similarity region but in the region near an area source, a proposed modification to the Gaussian equation showed a better fit than the standard Gaussian equation. The centreline vertical velocity as a function of height by experiment showed two distinct regions and this supports the work of Colomer, et al. (1999). In the first region, the present experimental results showed the same pattern as the model of Colomer, et al. but in the second region the model of Colomer, et al. is in doubt because the value of their centreline velocity increases with distance away from the area source, which is in contrast to the present experimental results and contradicts to a decreasing velocity that one would expect on dimensional grounds.In the experimental study of thermal plumes in an enclosure, the spread of the plume vertical velocity radius was found to be wider than the plume temperature radius. The Gaussian equation also provided a good fit to the vertical velocity and temperature data in the far-field region. The modified Gaussian equation was used to fit the data in the near-field region. In the numerical study, it was found that the choice of the value of constants in the turbulence model had the effect on the results of simulation. For example, when the value of C&#949;3  and the value of turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) were set to 0.6 and 0.65, respectively the numerical results showed a good match with experimental results of both saline plumes and thermal plumes.Plumes from the &#8216;hot&#8217; processes such as metallurgical operations (e.g. foundries, furnace tapping, charging), are often generated from area sources and such plumes frequently do not reach a self-similar state due to the space over the &#8216;hot&#8217; processes is not high enough. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to determine plume characteristics, such as temperature or density distribution, velocity profile and plume width in the near-field region where the plume profiles are not self-similar.The results of this study provide new information on the fundamental behaviour of plumes from area sources and will assist in the improvement of the design procedures for industrial ventilation systems and other building ventilation system applications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viewpoints consistency management using belief merging operators</field><field name="creator">Lin, Qiuming</field><field name="description">Handling inconsistent requirement specifications is a critical and difficult issue in requirements engineering.

The research outlined in this thesis is an investigation of the microstructure and mechanical properties of weldments of 2.25Cr-1Mo steel before and after the application of preheat and/or post weld heat treatment. Trial welds and simulated coarse grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ) material were mechanically tested and etallurgically examined before and after welding and PWHT.The pre-heat investigation involved 3.8 mm and 7.1 mm thick tubes, welded with pre-heats of 25 &#176;C, 50 &#176;C and the standard 150 &#176;C. These samples were then mechanically tested to AS3992. The PWHT investigation was carried out on 12 mm thick tube and 16 and 26 mm thick plate samples. After welding, the samples were heated to a simulated service temperature of 550 &#176;C for up to 10 h and PWHT at 700 &#176;C. These samples were then compared in terms of microstructure and hardness.To enable mechanical testing of HAZ material, simulated HAZ material was produced. These controlled cooling samples also enabled monitoring of the transformation behaviour to produce a CCT diagram and comparison of the transformation products with the trial welds. The results of this experimental program showed that pre-heating thin tubes in the range 25-150 &#176;C had no noticeable effect on their properties. It is however expected that the influence of the pre-heat temperature would be limited to the root pass, as the higher interpass temperature would override any effect of the pre-heat temperture. The welds made in 12 mm and 16 mm thick material also showed negligible difference in their response to short-term ageing and PWHT. The results from the 26 mm sample however showed higher hardness and a different microstructure to those of other plate thicknesses.Thus no evidence based on mechanical properties and microstructures was found to support the specification in the Australian Standard AS4458 for pre-heat 7 temperatures above 25 &#176;C when welding tubes up to 7.1 mm thick. Furthermore, although the Australian Standards do not require PWHT for 12 mm tube, but specify PWHT for 16 mm plate, the present results do not provide a basis for the need for PWHT in either case. These conclusions are drawn within the context that the experimental welds were made under low restraint conditions and high restraint in industrial practice could affect weldment integrity through the development of high residual stresses, distortion and/or HAZ cracking.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turning user into first level support in help desk: development of web-based user self-help knowledge management system</field><field name="creator">Leung, Nelson K.

This has resulted in reliance of help desks to support users to deal with a wide range of information technology related problems such as hardware, software and telecommunication. The help desk generally has to cover a wide range of information technology products and services. However, due to resources problem, in particular the lack of help desk staff, users often have to wait for a considerably long time before their enquiries and problems are answered and solved. Literature has shown that the majority of incoming enquiries are considered to be simple and routine which do not require specialized knowledge. This research investigates the feasibility of developing a web-based user self-help knowledge management system by applying techniques in knowledge management and software agent technology to improve the support process of routine and simple technical enquires in the help desk. In this research, simple and routine technical enquiries are classified as problems that can be solved by users if sufficient information is provided. A survey is conducted to identify queries and problems that are considered to be simple and routine. The results also show that a decrease of incoming enquiries can be expected if sufficient online information, trainings, guidelines and technical documentations are provided to the users. A conceptual knowledge management framework has been developed to create, store, make available, use and evaluate knowledge. A prototype has been developed to demonstrate the capability of providing solutions to simple and routine enquiries. Software agent technology and ontology are applied in the proposed system. Software agent provides autonomous handling of queries and ontology formalises vocabulary in the system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of novel high energy density cathode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries</field><field name="creator">Bewlay, Stephen L</field><field name="description">&#8220;Synthesis of Novel High Energy Density Cathode Materials for Lithium Rechargeable Batteries&#8221; summarises 4 years of research by Stephen L. Bewlay in ISEM at the University of Wollongong (UoW). A brief historical introduction is given to previous research &amp; understanding of Li battery cathode materials, with references to many published papers and resources.Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP)  materials were prepared as Li battery cathode material and extensively intercompared. Our group was the first in the world to publish on formation of LFP from inexpensive precursors via spray pyrolysis &amp; hydrogelation/aerogellation. Detailed thermodynamic calculations by the author show why spray-pyrolysed LFP can exist in a normal atmosphere without danger of converting Fe2+ (Ferrous) into unwanted Fe3+ (Ferric) ions. Synchrotron XRD measured crystal lattice spacings of sol-gel &#8220;pure&#8221; (actually slightly carbon-enriched) and Ti-doped LFP, and XANES (X-Ray Absorbtion Near- Edge Scattering) was done on Fe K-band X-radiation to quantify subtle changes in the environment of LFP Fe ions at various stages of charge/discharge. HRTEM was used to show convincingly that carbon residues from sucrose tended to coat the outside of LFP crystallites, enhancing the surface conductivity of LFP powder grains. A calibration chart was  onstructed to allow estimation of actual wt.% levels of residual carbon from a simple, single DTA/TGA measurement.\Dependence of LFP electrical conductivity on temperature was measured for both pure and Mg-doped LFP samples between room temperature and 400 oC.LFP has been celebrated in scientific journal publications as being more people- and environment-friendly than LiCoO2, but it is proven experimentally by the author that it underachieves its theoretical energy density and instead usually achieves close to the existing LiCoO2 cathode paste capacities. This was despite use of sophisticated techniques such as sucrose-induced carbon enrichment &amp; hydrogel/aerogel methods.Vanadium Pentoxides (V2O5) from differing synthetic pathways (spray pyrolysis, aerogellation) were verified to be promising cathode pastes, with discharge capacities &gt;200 mAh/g &amp; capacity losses ~0.4%/cycle. Spray-pyrolysed V2O5 was particularly intriguing &#8211; having a near-perfect spherical shape and a mass density ~80% of crystalline V2O5.WS2 nanotubes were synthesized from ammonium tetrathiotungstate by a unique 2- step un-templated furnace technique, with dimensions verified by TEM and HRTEM. WS2 nanotubes electrode pastes yielded a discharge capacity of ~ 200 mAh/g, &amp; capacity loss ~ 0.2%/cycle.MoS2 nano-material was synthesized and demonstrated by SEM to have unique, porous, parallel nanolayers, a result corroborated by other published research. Attempts to synthesise FeS2 fortuitously resulted in a new synthesis method dubbed &#8220;solid state dilution&#8221;, yielding nano-magnetite (Fe3O4) powder with 1st discharge capacity ~302 mAh/g when used as anode material.Current-Voltage curves, Charge/Discharge capacity and cyclability were assessed for many materials, with suggestions for further research on the most promising.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location of injury site in chronic low back pain patients: an electromyographic and mechanomyographic analysis</field><field name="creator">Gorelick, Mark</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to determine if anatomical injury site in chronic low back (CLBP) patients can be identified by two complementary non-invasive diagnostic techniques, surface electromyography (sEMG) and mechanomyography (MMG). The application of these techniques to injury site identification is based upon the hypothesis that muscle tissues surrounding an injured joint are physiologically distinct from those surrounding &#8220;healthy&#8221; joints. Such changes in muscle physiology, associated with underlying joint pathology, may include alterations in muscle fibre type composition and number with a corresponding change in the muscle&#8217;s speed of contraction and its pattern of neuromotor control. These injury-induced changes in muscle function should be readily detected, at least in superficial muscles, by simple kinesiological techniques such as sEMG and/or MMG. Six experimental studies were conducted to validate the diagnostic tools (sEMG and MMG) and to locate injury site in a total of 73 normal and CLBP subjects and a group of 12 Wistar rats. The results of these studies validated the combined sEMG and MMG techniques and concluded that injury site in diagnosed CLBP patients could be accurately identified to within one vertebral segment of the injured zygapophyseal joint through application of the MMG technique. Importantly, the MMG technique appeared to be more sensitive than the sEMG technique to identify the injury site in CLBP patients. Although the sEMG technique could significantly (p&lt;0.05) differentiate between the CLBP and healthy control groups, it was unable detect specific changes in muscle contractile properties associated with underlying joint pathology.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery and pattern classification of large scale harmonic measurements using data mining</field><field name="creator">Asheibi, Ali Taher M.</field><field name="description">Harmonic monitoring is an important issue for electricity utilities and their customers.  Continuous monitoring of voltage and current are required to identify any substantial harmonic events before they occur. This monitoring results in large volumes of multivariate data. Although researchers have realised that such large amounts of power quality (PQ) data hold much more information than that reported using classical statistical techniques for PQ monitoring, few have taken the opportunity to exploit this additional information. This hidden information might be of assistance in the identification of critical issues for diagnoses of harmonic problems such as, predicting failures in advance and giving alarms prior to the onset of dangerous situations.Utility engineers are now seeking new tools in order to extract information that may otherwise remain hidden, especially within large volumes of data. Data mining tools are an obvious candidate for assisting in such analysis of large scale data. Data mining can be understood as a process that uses a variety of analytical tools to identify hidden patterns and relationships within data. Classification based on clustering is an important utilisation of unsupervised learning within data mining, in particular for finding and describing a variety of patterns and anomalies in multivariate data through various machine learning techniques and statistical methods. Clustering is often used to gain an initial insight into complex data and particularly in this case, to identify underlying classes within harmonic data.The main data mining methodology used in this work is that of mixture modelling based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) algorithm which essentially searches for a model which best describes the data using a metric of an encoded message.  This method of unsupervised learning, or clustering, has been shown to be able to detect anomalies and identify useful patterns within the monitored harmonic data set. Anomaly detection and pattern recognition in harmonic data can provide engineers with a rapid, visually oriented method for evaluating the underlying operational information contained within the data set.A case study from power quality data upon which the MML method has been applied, was taken from a harmonic monitoring program installed in a typical 33/11kV MV zone substation in Australia that supplies ten 11kV radial feeders. Several patterns have been identified from using the MML technique on the harmonic data, such as significant high harmonic disturbances, footprints of the monitored sites, unusual harmonic events (capacitor switching, turn on televisions, air conditioners and the off peak hot water system) and detection of different abstractions (super-groups), each of which comprise similar clusters. The C5.0 supervised learning algorithm has been used to generate expressible and understandable rules which identify the essential features of each member cluster, and to further utilize these in predicting which ideal clusters any new observed data may best described by.  One difficulty with the MML algorithm when used to derive various mixture models is the difficulty in establishing a suitable stopping criterion to secure the optimum number of (mixture) clusters during the clustering process. A novel technique has been developed to overcome this difficulty using the trend of the exponential of message length difference between consecutive mixture models. First, the proposed method has been tested using data from known number of clusters with randomly generated data points and also with data from a simulation of a power system. The results from these tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimum number of clusters. Second, the developed method has been applied to various two-weekly data sets from the harmonic monitoring program used on this thesis. The optimum number of clusters has been verified by the formation of supergroups using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and link analysis. Third, the method was benchmarked against a commonly used fitness function technique, which has underestimated the optimal number of cluster in the measured harmonic data. This resulted from the theoretical maximum entropy equation used in calculating the fitness function that assumes the attributes are independent which is not the case in the correlated nature of the harmonic attributes. Finally, generated rules from the C5.0 algorithm were used for classification and prediction of future events to determine which cluster any new data should belong to.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on diluted oxide magnetic semiconductors for spin electronic applications</field><field name="creator">Peleckis, Germanas</field><field name="description">Conventional semiconductor electronics is based on the charge of the electron. For a long time the spin of the electron has been ignored in the field of conventional electronics. Spintronics, also called spin electronics, agnetoelectronics or magnetotronics, is a newly emerging field in solid state physics and information technology. One of the major challenges for  emiconductor spintronic devices is to develop suitable novel spin-polarized magnetic semiconducting materials that will effectively allow spin-polarized carriers to be injected, transported, and manipulated. Therefore, searching for new materials has become crucial from the viewpoints of both fundamental research and practical applications.Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) are one of the most promising candidates for spintronic application. The research on the DMS materials which has been carried out worldwide in the past decade has been reviewed in this thesis. A DMS material can be realized when a conventional host semiconductor, such as GaAs, ZnO, etc., is doped with magnetic impurities, usually transition metal (TM) ions. For practical application, DMS material should favorably be ferromagnetic (FM) at room temperature. Early studies on DMS materials showed that FM can be induced in Mn doped III-V semiconductors. However, these materials are not suitable for practical applications as their Curie temperatures are quite low. On the other hand, some theoretical works predicted room temperature ferromagnetism in TM doped oxide semiconductors. This fact has boosted research in the field of DMS materials. The number of reports on observations of room temperature FM in Co, Mn, Ni, and Cr doped ZnO and TiO2 semiconducting oxides is constantly growing. The aim of this thesis was to study the doping effects of transition metal ions on the structure, transport, and diluted magnetic properties of various host oxide semiconductors. The oxide semiconductors investigated in this work are: ZnO, CuO, Ga2O3, and In2O3. A search for room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors was the key point of this research. In addition, we have tried to understand and explain the possible origins of the magnetic properties of the samples produced, because at the present time there is no firm theoretical model that could explain magnetism in DMS materials.The majority of the samples studied in this research were prepared by a conventional solid state synthesis technique. We have carried out X-ray diffraction and electricalmagnetic transport measurements to determine the crystal structure, electrical and magnetic properties of our samples. In order to investigate the valence state of transition metal ions in the prepared materials, X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy analysis was used.The major results from this PhD study are: (1) Polycrystalline Co-doped ZnO oxide samples were prepared with Co doping levels varying between 1 and 10%. All samples were found to be paramagnetic without any trace of ferromagnetism at room temperature and were insulators. Introduction of In ions into the system decreased the electrical resistivity of the samples. The spin state assessment revealed that strong spin-orbital coupling is present in In containing samples. Valence state assessment showed that in ZnO Co is present in the 2+ valence state.(2) Mn doped CuO bulk samples showed a ferromagnetic transition at 80 K. All the samples prepared were insulating. In and Zn were used as charge donors. It was found that the In solubility limit in CuO lattice is very limited, less than 1%. The magnetic properties that were measured showed a large decrease in the magnetic susceptibility of (Mn,Zn) and (Mn,In) co-doped CuO samples. This could be attributed to the formation of large amounts of antiferromagnetic impurities and phase segregation in the samples. Valence state assessment showed that Mn is present in the 2+ valence state, eliminating the possibility of a double exchange interaction mechanism in this system.(3) Various transition metal ions, such as Mn, Fe, Cr, and Ni, were doped into In2O3 and indium-tin oxide (ITO). In contrast to the reported data, our Fe doped In2O3 samples were paramagnetic. Paramagnetism was also observed in Cr doped In2O3. Mn doped In2O3 samples were insulators with a Curie temperature of 46 K, while Mn doped ITO samples were typical semiconductors with the same Curie temperature. Furthermore, these samples showed a large positive MR effect below the ferromagnetic transition temperature, reaching 20% at a temperature of 5 K. Ni doped In2O3 and ITO samples were also found to be ferromagnetic at room temperature. Electrical transport properties, though, were different in nature. Ni doped In2O3 was found to be a typical semiconductor, while the electrical conductivity of Ni doped ITO was found to be characteristic of metallic materials.(4) (Fe,Mn) co-doped In2O3 and ITO samples were ferromagnetic at room temperature, being both conducting and insulating depending on the host semiconductor. The change in lattice parameter a was very dependent on the ratio of Mn to Fe in the system, with decrease in lattice parameter a as Fe content increased. The maximum saturation magnetization was found for an In1.80Mn0.12Fe0.08O3 sample, which reached 0.35 &#956;B/(Mn,Fe) ions at a temperature of 300 K. (Mn,Fe) co-doped In2O3 samples were insulating at room temperature, while (Fe,Cr) co-doped In2O3 samples were both conducting and ferromagnetic at room temperature. In addition, (Fe,Cr) co-doped samples showed a large positive MR effect, i.e. 5% at 5 K. On the contrary, despite being good conductors, (Mn,Fe) co-doped ITO samples did not exhibit similar MR features.(5) (RE,Fe) co-doped In2O3 polycrystalline samples were semiconducting and showed giant positive magnetoresistance at 5 K. The obtained magnetoresistance in (Eu,Fe) co-doped In2O3 reached 80 % at 5 K. This value is the largest reported MR value for any diluted magnetic semiconductor. In addition (RE,Fe) co-doped samples showed clear ferromagnetic hysteresis behavior at 300 K. TEM studies of these samples revealed that particles are well formed and are about 100 nm in size.Based on the results, among the transition metal doped oxide semiconductors studied, In2O3 and ITO are the most promising candidates for diluted semiconductor materials with possible practical applications in spintronic devices.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a capability development model for professional school leaders in Thai education</field><field name="creator">Chongcharoen, Koolchalee</field><field name="description">This study explores questions of how Thai school leaders can be better prepared to respond to reforms that propose decentralization, devolution of authority and organizational structures that favor school-based management (SBM) (See Caldwell &amp; Spinks, 1988). The implementation of SBM is a substantial departure from the historically hierarchical and centralized Thai education bureaucracy. The research explored what capabilities are required for this new environment and suggests a capability development model for professional school leaders in Thailand. The research explored literature on self-managing schools, school-based management and educational reform and found that successful reform was dependent on several factors.  This included collaboration, participatory practices, leadership that utilized skills in involving staff, students and community. There is also a need for the system to recognize the need to support devolution and SBM. The research recognized the importance of systemic change and individual agency and used Anthony Giddens&#8217; notion of structuration as a theoretical tool to explore how leaders should be prepared to respond to systemic and professional changes.The study uses a qualitative methodology using interviews, focus group and reviews of documentation to answer two research questions, 1) What are the key capabilities that Thai school leaders should have in relation to the values and visions of multiple stakeholders in Thai education? 2) What forms of professional development are required for a capability development model which can sustain multiple stakeholders in a global world? The purposive sampling was employed to select fifty participants who were experts and the stakeholders.Consistent with the notion of structuration, the data indicated that the structural changes associated with education reform are strongly related to changes of the power and the responsibility of the individuals in the system. The data suggests that there is a need for shifts in behaviors that favors collaboration, participatory practices, visionary leadership and involvement of teachers and the community in school management. This is contradicted by a culture of compliance to superiors and a culture of deference that makes involvement difficult. The findings also showed that bureaucracy and strong hierarchies, which have characterized Thai public institutions, has had a strong influence on the national culture which in turn is a key influence on personality and character for Thais. This feature is seen in this study as an ongoing tension and future concern for Thai school leaders&#8217; capability development.The research found that there is strong support for SBM and that the need for reform is appreciated, there exists strong reservations about the capabilities required to implement change and SBM. The research focused on identifying the capabilities across the system as suggested by leaders, teachers and administrators and the research also looked at what capabilities were needed by these groups to implement SBM.The research also identified the need for more democratic and participatory structures that enabled school leaders to develop a wider repertoire of skills and capabilities. The research proposes a model of capability development, which identified areas for systematic and individual development.The data indicated that the three specific roles were considered essential for Thai school leaders, which are educational strategic thinking, building and managing a collaborative school culture, and providing educational leadership in school in these circumstances.  The key findings showed that the nine domains of professional capability were required to support these new roles namely: change management; strategic thinking; pedagogical content knowledge; facilitating continuous learning and development; working collaboratively with others; communication and interpersonal skill; student and customer focus and quality; self efficacy; and personal integrity.The research identified the need for continuous professional development that included work-based learning, mentoring and features a modeling collaborative and participatory practice using communities of practice and authentic learning tasks. This is in contrast to current practice, which lacks professional development or favors passive modes of learning. The research finds that to foster and sustain capability development in this model, it requires the system development to create the ways or methods for school leaders&#8217; growth. Finally, the thesis suggests that the Thai government should establish the national program for school leaders&#8217; development, which works with the existing leadership-training providers in a networking system. Such a proposed network should focus on the development of the curriculum for serving the individual&#8217;s needs and the techniques for school leaders&#8217; capability development in the attainment of such capabilities. Such programs should utilize a framework proposed in this research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A practical investigation into how education providers can effectively exploit web services</field><field name="creator">Ding, Dong</field><field name="description">This research is a practical investigation into how education providers can effectively exploit Web Services. The aim is to help IT managers, administrators and developers who are involved in the provision of education to understand the requirements of web services, and to tap their full potential. Such a goal was achieved by analyzing answers to the following questions: 1. Are Web Services expected to become a crucial part of the IT infrastructure for education providers? 2. How can education providers effectively exploit Web Services in practice? Like it or not, it is an indisputable fact that today's education is becoming a profitable industry. Like an enterprise in any other industry, an education provider also faces many challenges. These challenges derive from keeping competitive advantage and satisfying rapidly growing customer demands within a limited budget. Those challenges are typically reflected in the IT (information technology) expenditure of education providers. Advanced e-business strategies require education providers to build an integrated and flexible IT infrastructure. However, education providers often face a heterogeneous computing environment that significantly lacks both interoperability and flexibility. The traditional method of integrating such a heterogeneous computing environment is very expensive, and often, prior investment is lost. Web Services can provide a cost-effective approach to solve many problems of interoperability, as well as providing flexibility for IT infrastructure. Though implementing a kind of loosely coupled integration, Web Services can integrate modern technology with legacy system (eg: the Web with mainframe application), and heterogeneous systems running on different operating system (eg: Windows and UNIX), or written in different programming languages (eg: C++ and Java). In the long run, Web Services will become the basis for a seamless and nearly fully-automated IT infrastructure for conducting e-business. The following investigation into Web Services applications for education providers reveals how Web Services can be used as an important part of the IT infrastructure for education providers. This part of the investigation covers four scenarios, including modernizing legacy applications, a campus portal, a Web Services-enabled learning resource repository, and a Grid Service. It examines how Web Services can be used in these scenarios and what they contribute. It is found that Web services always play a role of middle tier that glues heterogenous systems together. One major attraction of Web Services is that they are easy to learn and use. They are developed on the base of existing technology. Nevertheless, an effective exploitation of the potential of Web Services requires an appropriate effort towards the proper design of business processes and service architectures. Patterns for E-business by IBM is used as the template for proper design of business process and service architecture. Those patterns can help one to rapidly design a service architecture, and apply this to Web Services. An implementation-oriented demonstration is developed to illustrate how to use e-business patterns to design the service architecture for an e-business solution, finally applying it to Web Services.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the effects of fission-fragment damage on activation energies in AG/Bi2223 tapes</field><field name="creator">Marinaro, Dami&#225;n</field><field name="description">Ag/Bi-2223 tapes doped with small quantities of highly enriched uranium were prepared by the powder-in-tube process and irradiated with thermal neutrons. The resulting fission fragments create randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects that provide strong flux pinning. Significant improvements in the field and angular dependence of the critical current density and in the irreversibility field were observed at 77 K, increasing with the density of fission tracks. In tapes with equivalent fission track density, the observed increases are larger for the samples exposed to larger neutron fluences (where a lower uranium doping level requires higher neutron fluence to obtain the same fission track density). This is explained as a result of the formation of secondary uranium-containing phases physically separated from the Bi2223 phase above a solubility limit to the uranium doping. An unusual exponential dependence of Hirr on the density of tracks was also observed, unrelated to the secondary phase formation. The primary investigation concerns the activation energies for vortex motion in the thermally activated flux flow and flux creep regimes, probed via resistive transition and dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements, which had not been previously explored. Both methods demonstrate the dominance of the fission tracks in the pinning landscape, particularly in fields applied parallel to the c-axis. Linearity in an Arrhenius plot of the superconductor resistance against temperature over at least three orders of magnitude indicated thermally activated flux motion in tapes with and without fission damage. In fields applied parallel to the c-axis, the pinning energy was substantially increased by the fission tracks, U0 tripling in magnitude at &#956;0H ~ 0.3 T, and then reconverging with the pre-irradiation U0 for &#956;0H &gt; 2 T. This behaviour of the activation energy is well described by an effective matching field Beff ~ 0.3 T, identified at the maximum in the relative change of U0 and also observed from changes in the behaviour of the resistively determined irreversibility field. This Beff is lower than the matching field B&#966; ~ 2.1 T estimated from the fission track density. Dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements were analysed using a modified form of Maley's method [M. P. Maley et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, p2639 (1990)]. This method was modified by using an empirically determined temperature scaling to resolve the current density dependence of the effective activation energy Ueff(J,H,T0) in the flux creep regime from different isothermal data points, over a wide range of temperatures and values of J. Correlated changes in the empirical temperature scaling form U(T), an additive constant C, a fitting parameter &#956; and the divergent behaviour of Ueff as J &#8594; 0 are all consistent with a dimensional crossover from 3D elastic to 2D plastic creep at fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.37 T in a nonirradiated tape. The dimensional crossover was shifted to higher fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.65 T after the introduction of fission-fragment damage, interpreted as evidence that the randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects promote c-axis vortex correlation in the Ag/Bi2223 tapes. Analysis of the relaxation data without the additional temperature scaling modification, on the other hand, produced a conflicting result, implying the complete destruction of c-axis vortex correlation over the entire field range explored. This observation is inconsistent with measurements of the current &#8211; voltage characteristics. Together with the unreasonable values of C obtained by this analysis and in comparison to the consistency observed with the empirically determined temperature scaling modification, the results indicate that the inclusion of the empirical temperature scaling is essential to an analysis of relaxation data. In comparison to past studies, we conclude that the efficiency of the uranium-fission method in enhancing the flux pinning is strongly dependent on the material anisotropy, through the vortex line elasticity and dimensionality, which hence affect the vortex line accommodation to the splayed defects. This has significant consequences for the estimation of B&#966; in materials with differing anisotropy. The present method of calculating B&#966; directly from the fission track density multiplied by the average defect track length is an oversimplification, which does not take into account the finite elasticity of the flux lines as well as the anisotropy of the vortex system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining generic programming with vector processing for machine vision</field><field name="creator">Lai, Bing-Chang</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the integration of generic programming with vector processing for machine vision. While generic libraries have been shown to provide near optimal performance without sacrificing flexibility and adaptability, current generic libraries do no utilise the vector processing unit (VPU), nor can they be vectorised directly. Generic vectorised libraries require a mechanism for expressing vectorised algorithms independently of the VPU. This is a problem since different VPUs can have different instructions and different limitations; programs written to use one vector technology are not portable to other vector technologies. Lastly, most existing machine-vision libraries do not provide image capture from sequence grabbers; the programmer has to use another library to capture images, and to supply additional code to enable the two libraries to work together. To allow vectorised, machine-vision algorithms to be portable across different vector technologies, this thesis proposes the use of an abstract VPU. The abstract VPU represents a set of real VPUs with a virtual VPU that has an idealized instruction set and constraints common to the real VPUs being represented. An abstract VPU, named Virtual Vector Machine (VVM), was developed to support generic programming. Different methods of implementing VMM were evaluated against hand-coded AltiVec (a vector technology found in PowerPC G4 and G5 processors) and scalar programs. The implementation chosen has no significant overheads when processing VVM vectors with a single AltiVec vector or a single scalar when compiled using Apple GCC 3.1 20021003. VVM vectors with a single AltiVec vector or scalar cover all byte AltiVec vectors in AltiVec mode and all types in scalar mode. When processing VVM vectors that use more than one AltiVec vector, the VVM implementation chosen is within 24% slower than a hand-coded program. Vectorised algorithms are difficult to implement, because they handle VPU-specific issues such as memory alignments, edges and prefetching. Thus, to reduce the number of algorithms required, a categorization of image processing operations based on input-to-output correlation is proposed. This categorization maps easily to generic programming and provides implementation hints. The categorization scheme separates image processing operations into three categories, which this thesis refers to as a quantitative, transformative and convolutive operations. Quantitative operations require one input element to produce zero or more output elements. Transformative operations require one input element to produce one output element. Convolutive operations produce a single output element from a rectangle of input elements. Each category requires only one general algorithm. Variations of the algorithm to handle differing input and output set combinations are also required. The generic, vectorised, machine-vision library, Vectorised Vision (VVIS), developed in this thesis uses the abstract VPU (VVM) and the three categories to provide cross-platform, vectorised algorithms. Because the division of duties used by existing generic libraries is unsuitable for vectorisation, two new divisions of duties are proposed and their performance is evaluated. Generic, vectorised algorithms for each category were evaluated against hand-coded programs and the speedup gained by using VVIS in AltiVec mode instead of scalar mode was collated. The VVIS implementation is comparable to hand-coded AltiVec and scalar programs when operating on single-channel byte images when processing quantitative and transformative operations. For convolutive operations, the final VVIS implementation is twice as slow in AltiVec mode when processing single-channel byte images, because the hand-coded AltiVec program did not need to support variable kernel sizes. In scalar mode, the final VVIS convolutive algorithm is comparable to hand-coded scalar programs. VVIS was slower than hand-coded programs when processing non-byte images, because of overheads introduced by VVM. For the transformative operations tested, VVIS, when executed in AltiVec moded instead of scalar mode, provides at most a four fold speedup depending on the operation when processing single-channel byte images. For convolutive operations tested, VVIS provides a speedup of approximately 1.5 times when processing single-channel byte images, despite using signed short internally; the VVM implementation used had noticeable overheads when operating on signed shorts in AltiVec mode. Results show that a generic, vectorised, machine-vision library generally have comparable performance to hand-coded programs when processing single-channel byte images. Because of overheads introduced by the VMM implementation, VVIS does not have comparable performance for all image types. Most image processing operations however use either single-channel byte or multi-channel byte images.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business model developments for the PC-based massively multiplayer online game(MMOG) industry</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Wei-Hsiang</field><field name="description">The development of information technologies brings innovations into traditional entertainment, and this development allows for the creation of a new leisure style: online entertainment. Online entertainment is an emerging industry, and increasingly, companies are pursuing this new trend with profit motives. However, the struggle of online-music industries shows that the market is not yet mature, and is still seeking viable business models. Online-game industries are also going to face similar problems that those online-music industries have already experienced. The purpose of this thesis is to study business model developments for the online-game industry. The focus will be the PC-based Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). By utilizing the structure of the digital content value chain as a conceptual framework, this thesis will use this framework to analyse the structure of current business models. In order to improve current business models, analysing case studies and investigating key issues, which have a potential to influence the business development, are important in this thesis. The research will focus on three areas: marketing, game-play and financial issues. By seeking practicable solutions for key issues, these proposed solutions will be applied to create viable developments and restructure business models. The research method will review the last five years of research literature, explorations and case studies. This thesis mainly focuses on the case studies of Asian online-game developments, with a focus on Japanese and Korean game industries because their industries are the major players in the online-game market. In addition, the survey methods will include the use of the online questionnaire in order to obtain experiential resources and to increase the accuracy of this research. The contribution of this thesis is to establish viable business models based upon the experience of Japanese and Korean online-game developments as patterns, for Chinese and Western online-game industries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient trapdoor-based client puzzle system against DoS attacks</field><field name="creator">Gao, Yi</field><field name="description">Denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) are serious threats to computer networks. DoS and DDoS attacks aim to shut down a target server by depleting its resources and rendering it incapable of offering stable and integrated service to legitimate clients. Preventing DoS and DDoS attacks is a difficult task. A promising countermeasure against DoS attacks is the Client Puzzle method, which nevertheless faces a number of challenges, such as the complexity of puzzle construction and solution verification. Our research focuses on exploring novel puzzle constructions to satisfy the high demands of DoS defence in practice. In this thesis, we first identify the underlying weaknesses of existing client puzzles. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we recommend the necessary requirements for good client puzzles. Based on this, we propose a new model for puzzle distribution, called the Trapdoor-based Client Puzzle System (TCPS). Two specific schemes are presented to construct puzzles within TCPS. We depict these two schemes, where each trapdoor algorithm is applied respectively. Both schemes have two distinct features: the computational overheads are low, and the difficulty level of puzzles is measurable. Moreover, both puzzle schemes are provably secure under traditional hard problems in mathematics. Our contribution to client puzzle defence against DoS attacks can be summarised as follows: * Identify the shortcomings of existing client puzzles. * Recommend the requirements of good client puzzles. * Formally define the Trapdoor-based Client Puzzle System, along with strict security conditions. * Propose a client puzzle scheme whose security is based on the RSA Assumption. Effectiveness and security are analysed and proven. * Propose a second client puzzle scheme whose security is based on the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). Similarly, effectiveness and security are also analysed. * Provide a possible configuration for system parameters. * Discuss further possible attacks and their solutions. As our research is carried out in DoS attack scenarios, we also introduce this technical background before our achievements are presented.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An artificial intelligence model to simulate strip flatness in a tandem cold rolling mill</field><field name="creator">You, Changyu</field><field name="description">Strip flatness is a very important quality criterion in the cold rolling process.

This study aims to develop a simple, practical model to simulate cold rolling and embody the fuzzy logic flatness control through mechanical and coolant control devices. For this research a high dimensional data set from a cold rolling mill was captured and analysed, and neural networks were applied to predict strip flatness. Preliminary results show that the proposed scheme has the potential to increase accuracy in predicting flatness. Mechanical and thermal actuators combined with fuzzy logic control rules have been developed to achieve the flatness control.

It does so firstly by developing a typology of skill, identifying and distinguishing the "artisanal" from the industrial concept. The artisanal concept of skill existed as part of the cluster of pre-industrial European attitudes to society and labour, the principal emphasis of which was their existence outside the market relations of capitalism. In contrast, the industrial concept of skill meshed absolutely with the characteristic features of capitalist social and productive relations. Not only did it inscribe specialised and mechanised labour with skill, but it also positively embraced the notion of labour, and skill in particular, as a commodity.This typology is the central motif of the thesis, which traces the relationship of both concepts to the history of industrial capitalism in New South Wales between 1840 and 1915. It argues that up to 1900, the artisanal concept dominated the understanding of work and its classification in New South Wales. However, from 1870this dominance was increasingly contested, and by the early twentieth century the artisanal concept had been displaced by the industrial.The thesis examines this process as it occurred in a variety of social locations - the New South Wales censuses, 1841-1911; the colony's general history of capital and labour, 1840-1900; in the early twentieth century New South Wales Arbitration Court; and in the more specific site of the iron trades, the history of which between 1840and 1915is viewed through the typology of skill. The central explanation for this displacement lies in an increasing acceptance of the commodification of labour power by a variety of actors in New South Wales. The distribution of artisanal and industrial approaches to skill thus did not readily fall into alignments of class, race or gender. Rather, the displacement of the former by the latter represented not so much the victory of industrial capitalism over the working class it spawned, but a reconfiguration of the relationships between classes in New South Wales. A new social order was born, and with it a new way of conceptualising human ability became dominant.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A paradigm for delivering a scalable and low-latency immersive voice over IP service to resource-constrained clients in distributed virtual environment</field><field name="creator">Que, Ying Peng</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem space of developing a high quality, yet scalable multi-party voice communication service to the ever more popular Distributed Virtual Environments (DVE) exemplified by the Multiplayer Online Games (MOG). The social interactive experience of DVE users can be greatly enhanced if the users feel immersed in a realistic environment via high fidelity visual scenes, auditory scenes and haptics. While recognising the primary role played by the visual scenes and the consequent rapid progresses made in the field of computer graphics, in this thesis, we investigate the network delivery of live DVE user voices which will be an important supplement to the primary visual scenes in creating the sense of immersion for the DVE users. The Immersive Voice over IP (VoIP) service is characterised by the creation of an auditory scene for each user which is the personalised mix of all the voices within that user&#8217;s hearing range. Each constituent voice stream in an auditory scene is localised (directional placement) and distance-attenuated in accordance with the visual positions of corresponding users in the virtual world. We believe the auditory scenes created for Immersive VoIP will be much more conducive to the creation of users&#8217; sense of immersion than the currently prevalent text-chat and mono VoIP applications. During our literature review, we first identified three key challenges faced by the Immersive VoIP service provider, i.e., the need to reduce respectively, the voice processing cost, the voice exchange bandwidth cost and the voice transmission latency. In view of the limited resources onboard the DVE clients (especially the wireless clients), the concept of server-rendered Immersive VoIP service is proposed which employs dedicated servers to complete the computationally expensive voice rendering tasks on behalf of the clients. Nevertheless, in exchange for the minimisation of client-side resource loads, a server processing scalability problem is created where each of the Auditory Scene Creation (ASC) servers could bear a prohibitively large processing load when supporting a large and dense user population. In the course of conducting subjective listening tests, we soon realised that the further away a listener is from the voice source, the greater is the voice localisation error which can be tolerated by the listener. This important result verifies the conjecture of distance-governed variable ii Abstract iii acceptable_localisation_error which allows the same localised voice to be shared between nearby listening users. This conjecture allows for siginifcant reductons in voice processing cost through the computational reuse of voice localisation results. In addition to considering the static Auditory Scene Creations, a mechanism known as the Transitional Deviation Reduction Algorithm has also been devised to address the issue that the Immersive VoIP users can be annoyed by more than 5 degrees of angular shifts between the voices localised at successive time instants with respect to the same speaking avatar. To ensure low voice latency for the latency-critical Immersive VoIP service, we propose a two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture. In this architecture, the voice transmission path between any pair of communicating avatars is always two overlay hops, i.e., from the speaking client to the assigned ASC server (1st hop) then from the ASC server to the listening client (2nd hop). As shown by our simulations results, this two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture is capable of significantly improving the voice transmission latency from the central server architecture and the prior distributed server solution devised in (Nguyen, 2006), especially for the challenging, yet realistic DVE scenario where there is a low level of correlations between the distribution of avatars in the DVE virtual world and the distribution of physical clients in the underlying geographically dispersed network. The objective of our server selection/assignment Linear Programming (LP) formulations is to obtain a balance between improving the voice transmission latency and mitigating the associated increases in the client-side voice upload bandwidth cost and the server-side voice processing cost. In particular, the Bandwidth Constrained Formulation reduces the client-side voice upload cost while still achieving a satisfactory level of latency performance by establishing a few ASC server sites which are very Latency Efficient, i.e., capable of meeting the acceptable_latency_constraints of a large number of communicating avatar pairs. However, the LP-based server assignment formulations were proven to be NP-hard and computationally expensive if executed in their original centralised format. Consequently, an alternative scheme was devised to divide the virtual world into equal size (measured in the number of avatar pairs enclosed) partitions so as to parallelise and distribute the execution of the server assignment formulations between different partitions. We examined the impact of avatar mobility in the virtual world on the performance of our distributed server assignment solutions, in particular the solution&#8217;s ability to balance Abstract iv between improving the voice latency and reducing the associated rises in client-side upload bandwidth cost. In our simulations, we found that the ASC servers need to be re-assigned at a regular frequency. Despite the significant scalability improvements made by our virtual world partitioning scheme, the optimised server assignment formulations, especially the complex, yet practical Bandwidth Constrained Formulation is still not scalable enough to meet the execution frequencies required for coping with avatar mobility. To this end, we have derived the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic which offers much faster execution time than the optimal server assignment mechanism, at the expense of small performance loss in terms of both latency and client-side upload bandwidth cost. By combining our virtual world partitioning scheme with the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic, we have produced a distributed server assignment solution which will enable the Immersive VoIP service to cope with frequent virtual world mobility for a wide range of DVE scenarios in terms of varying user population sizes and/or distribution densities. The only exception is a very sparse DVE which could require the ASC servers to be reassigned once per 60-70 seconds. Such a fast frequency is unrealistic considering the combined delays of server reassignment and handover. Consequently, a really sparse DVE with low intensity communication flows is probably best served by a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture with minimum management overhead rather than the client-server architectures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the phonological similarity effect: implications for short-term memory models</field><field name="creator">Nimmo, Lisa M</field><field name="description">The current thesis examined the effect that phonological similarity has on short-term memory (STM) performance. Across nine experiments, the predictions that two classes of STM models (non-linguistic and psycholinguisitic) generate for the effect that phonological similarity has on the recall of item information and memory for an items position in a list were tested. In the current thesis, phonological similarity was operationally defined in a number of different ways. For instance, lists of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words and nonwords, rhymed (shared VC component), shared the initial consonant and vowel (CV_component) or shared the two consonants (C_C component). Performance across these conditions was compared to when the stimulus lists were either phonemically dissimilar (ie used as a baseline measure of performance or phonemically similar (ie, each stimulus in each list had at least two phonemes in common with at least one other stimulus in the same list). Regardless of whether the experimental stimuli were words or nonwords, when performance was measured using the item recall criterion (scored as correct if a participant recalled an item that was presented in a list, regardless of position), an item recall advantage was observed for rhyming lists of stimuli. Non-linguistic STM models suggest that an item recall advantage should be observed whenever the size of the secondary memory search set can be limited to a smaller number of items (eg all items that rhyme). In contrast, psycholinguistic models of STM assume that this item recall advantage derives from sub-syllabic structures that aid the recall of item information. In terms of the effect that phonemic similarity has on order memory, the findings from the current thesis are inconsistent with the predictions generated from non-linguistic models of STM that are based on the distinctiveness assumption - the idea that as similarity increases order memory should decrease. Rather the findings are consistent with psycholinguistic models of STM that assume that the effect that phonemic similarity has on order memory is a consequence of linguistic constraints, such as sonority, that operate at the sub-syllabic as compared to lexical level. Based on the current research findings, modifications to existing STM models have been proposed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical success factors for executive information systems usage in organisations</field><field name="creator">Ikart, Emmanuel Matthew</field><field name="description">Executive Information Systems (EIS) are computer-based information systems (CBIS) designed to provide executives with easy on-line access to internal and external information relevant to their business success factors. The aim of EIS is to bring relevant information from the external environment and all parts of an organisation and present it in a way that is meaningful to executives. Hence, to improve the performance of executives' tasks, a significant number of organisations have invested heavily in EIS projects. Although executives presided over and authorised investment in EIS projects to support their roles, the majority of executives are unenthusiastic about using EIS because of the design flaws and failures of these systems. Due to this, the actual engagement with EIS by executives is relatively small. Although the failures of EIS in organisations can be linked to social, cultural, psychological and organisational factors rather than technical factors alone, previous research studies on EIS usage have focused on the overall benefits, pattern and frequency of use, impacts and emergence of EIS. Research efforts for key determinants of user acceptance and use of EIS have been constrained by a lack of appropriate reference theory and key variables. Further, research studies on the actual engagement of EIS by executives are rather limited in number or scope. Given this gap, this study aims to investigate and examine the cultural, social, individual and organisational critical success factors that might explain executives' behaviour to adopt and use EIS. Further, the study aims to establish the relative importance of these variables in determining user acceptance and the use of EIS in the organisational setting. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1986) and Triandis' framework (1979) are two of the important theories useful in predicting human behaviour with respect to. TAM proposes how users come to accept and use a technology and suggests that when a person is adopting a new technology, a number of factors such as its Perceived usefulness (PU), Perceived ease of use (PEOU), Attitude towards Using (ATU) and behavioural intentions (BI) influence their decision about how and when he/she will use it. Also, Triandis' framework, a theory from social psychology, explicitly addresses the social, cultural, individual and organisational factors that influence human behaviour. This study uses TAM and Triandis' framework as the theoretical foundation. However, the study extends TAM with such variables as Habits, Social factors and Facilitating conditions from Triandis&#65533; framework to derive a research model suitable for the adoption and usage of EIS in organisations. The model hypothesises that behaviour positively relates to: Habits (executives experience in computer-based information systems (CBIS), EIS and the ability to use EIS); Social factors (subjective norms, roles, values and social situations); and Facilitating conditions (EIS development processes, EIS management processes and organisational environment of EIS) by means of PU, PEOU and ATU. The study aims to: (1) provide a better understanding of the choices of executives in using EIS, (2) assist EIS developers to understand the core information processing requirements of the executives' tasks for which they are building EIS, in order to implement appropriate functionalities to support those tasks, (3) support researchers to further explain human behaviour towards IS including EIS acceptance and usage, based on the framework and research model, and (4) through the proposed model aims to redress the limitations of the extant research model, by accounting for intrinsic motivation and social-cultural factors relevant in explaining executives' behaviour towards EIS adoption and usage. Data used in testing the research model and associated hypotheses was collected using a mail survey questionnaire of executives such as the CFOs, CEOs and other executives from 255 organisations that use EIS in Australia. The results of this study emphasise the importance of social, cultural, individual and organisational variables in explaining executives' behaviour towards the adoption and usage of EIS by means of PU, PEOU and ATU. The importance of these variables from most influential to least influential is: social, cultural, individual and organisational variables. This study is a significant contribution to academic literature and management/ practice. Theoretically, the study has established TAM and Triandis' framework - as appropriate reference theories suitable in studying the adoption and usage of EIS by executives. Methodologically, the approach used for this study to address the research problem, as a behaviour using TAM and Triandis' framework variables is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge. This methodology is important for further research into IS including EIS adoption and usage by executives. Managerially/practically, the findings of this study have significant implications to EIS designers/developers, implementers and managers of organisations. (In particular, EIS designers and implementers are urged to take into account the importance of social factors, facilitating conditions, habits, PU and PEOU that influence the behaviour of EIS users to use EIS).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing evidence for practice in medical nutrition therapy: a case study of the impact of a high amylose resistant starch diet on clinical indicators of the insulin resistant syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brenninger, Vanessa</field><field name="description">In the context where current strategies employed by health professionals are not able to slow the increasing rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, collectively known as the insulin resistance syndrome (metabolic syndrome, syndrome X), evidence-based practice is central to implementing appropriate and targeted guidelines to the individual. The central hypothesis argued here is that for evidence based practice to have relevance there is value in collecting this evidence from both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. The aim of this thesis is to explore a number of aspects of research that produce evidence for the management of diet related disease. It uses as a reference point, a randomised controlled trial investigating the feasibility and efficacy of the incorporation of high amylose maize resistant starch on clinical, and dietary outcomes in an overweight sample of the population. Current research aims to develop the optimal nutrient mix for the insulin resistance syndrome, however, the challenge and focus now should be to make the benefits achievable in the &amp;quote real world &amp;quote (Storlien, Tapsell, Fraser, Leslie, Ball, Higgins, Helge and Owen 2001). To this end, a rigorous framework addressing dietetic and lifestyle issues was included in the randomised controlled trial. The nutrient of choice for the intervention trial was resistant starch (RS); a form of carbohydrate that reaches the lower gastrointestinal tract undigested and is consequently fermented. Resistant starch is composed of two polysaccharide forms; amylose and amylopectin. The beneficial effects are particularly evident from the amylose form compared to the more readily digested amylopectin. It demonstrates probiotic and dietary fibre-like characteristics hypothesised to be beneficial for people with the insulin resistance syndrome, hypercholesterolaemia and colon cancer due to its reduced availability as a source of energy, reduced energy density and its ability to lower colonic pH. Therefore RS has potential to be used in the dietary management for reducing risk factors for the insulin resistance syndrome. METHODOLOGY Three preliminary studies were performed to enable the accurate recording of significant lifestyle variables. The first employed sociolinguistics to conceptualise how and why inaccuracy in reporting of dietary intake occurs. Secondly, a lifestyle history questionnaire was developed to examine possible sources of baseline variation between subjects in the study. Finally, an intervention trial survey was designed to analyse subject&#65533;s experiences post-intervention such as barriers to adherence. Following these, a dietary intervention trial was conducted in overweight (BMI: 25-35kg/m2) adult volunteers. Subjects with any of the following were excluded: diabetes mellitus (fasting blood glucose level 6.1mmol/L), known hypercholesterolaemia or hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, renal disease, current smokers, pregnancy and those reporting a significant weight change in the previous 6 months. Twenty-five volunteers were randomly assigned to receive advice on either a diet high in RS or to a control diet low in RS. Control groups were maintained at a level of 6 grams of various types of RS, based on the Australian average consumption, while the RS group received 25 grams of RS derived from commercially manufactured RS containing an high amylose to amylopectin ratio. Subjects recorded foods used to achieve differences in RS using a daily checklist form. Foods recorded on daily checklist forms were analysed by counting. Repeated diet history (DH) interviews were performed in weeks 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12. Dietary data were entered into a nutrient analysis software package, FoodWorks (v2.10.136, Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, Brisbane) for further statistical comparisons. To estimate the accuracy of reporting dietary intakes the ratio of reported energy intake to estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR) was calculated. This method provides an index for comparison with cut-off limits that assess the validity of the reported energy intakes. Baseline metabolic and biochemical indicies were compared to those at 12 weeks after intervention. Insulin resistance was measured by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. Fasting respiratory quotient (RQ) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were measured by standard assays. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared and body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In the same subjects the acute response to RS diets and control diets were performed by a meal challenge (breakfast and lunch) at 12 weeks. The following variables were collected from participants while fasted and then postprandially on an hourly basis thereafter: RQ, RMR, plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride excursions and satiety. Statistical comparisons were made within groups initially and on completion and between groups over time using a statistical software package, JMP (Version 3.2, SAS institute Inc, Cary NC, 1989-1996). In addition, as derived from the preliminary studies, subjects completed lifestyle history questionnaires initially in week 0 and an intervention trial survey at 12 weeks. Survey responses were reviewed using content analysis to identify themes and applying a ranking of significance based on frequency of their occurrence. RESULTS Of the twenty-five subjects randomly assigned with random numbers to a high or low amylose-rich RS diet, twenty-two completed the trial. Twenty of these were classified as insulin resistant. The two subjects who were not insulin resistant had been randomly assigned to the high RS diet group. The discontinuing participants caused groups to become mismatched for gender, BMI and HDL cholesterol. In addition this caused the RS and control groups to be significantly different for insulin sensitivity with a mean and standard deviation of 6.01 plus or equal to 0.79 versus 3.51 plus or equal to 0.42 mg/kg.min respectively at week 12 (pequals0.006). There were no significant effects of 12 weeks intervention with control or RS diets on body composition (% change in body fat 6.3 versus 1.7 respectively, p&amp;greater than.05) and metabolic variables (change in insulin sensitivity 2.8% versus &#65533;8.4% respectively, p&amp;greater than0.05) despite reported compliance to the dietary goals for intervention foods. Assessment of the meal challenges displayed a smaller rise in glucose excursion in response to the RS pretreated group challenged with either low or high RS meals. The differences between fasting glucose response to a breakfast meal was significantly affected by the intervention diet (p=0.016). There was also a significant effect of test meal composition on insulin excursion reflecting an increased insulin response to low RS meals in both groups (p=0.04). The remaining variables measured during meal challenges were not significantly affected by meal composition or intervention diet. The lifestyle history questionnaire identified several variables, such as weight cycling and level of physical activity in the intervention group that may produce variation in response and further may explain the equivocal results. The final survey confirmed previous reports that individualised treatment is more effective and that the provision of foods in an intervention trial enhances compliance to dietary regimens. The preliminary study of diet history interviews emphasised the need for the interviewer to listen for verbal cues such as &amp;quote probably &amp;quote and &amp;quote it depends &amp;quote. These were most prominently identified in relation to energy dense foods and thereby assisted the interviewer in obtaining more accurate dietary descriptions. Visual displays of food quantities also needed to be available for more precise reporting of problematic meals to recount such as dinner. The diet history interview data collected during the intervention trial indicated a mean score for valid reporting for weeks 0, 3, 6 and 9, though greater under-reporting resulted in a decline in validity at week 12. DISCUSSION After 12 weeks the lack of significant differences between control and intervention groups in terms of changes in body composition, serum lipids, substrate utilisation and fasting plasma glucose/insulin levels suggested that, at least with this profile of subjects, there is no effect of habituation with 25g RS in the diet. This may reflect the impact of dosage (25g RS estimated for bowel health may not be enough for metabolic health), the small sample size of the study and/or attrition rates. An increase in insulin resistance of about 10% in the RS group was consistent with the data (mean change = -9.8%; 95% confidence limit: 29 + 9) however, approximately 40 subjects would have been required to detect an effect of this magnitude using the current protocol. A reduction in the insulin excursion when challenged with the high RS meals was reasonable considering what is known about RS metabolism, however this significant result was not reflected in the glucose values overall, nor did it translate to a metabolic benefit from chronic exposure. Overall, with the consumption of relatively moderate quantities of RS, and given that reported meal patterns and intakes of some nutrients varied over the duration of the trial, the metabolic effect could be explained by a variety of differentials. Human metabolic and behavioural variability are significant factors to consider in trials establishing the evidence for the optimal nutrient mix for the metabolic syndrome. First, there is diversity among humans in their genetic predisposition to disease. Second there are numerous points within a clinical trial where error in measurements may occur. In current practice clinicians are asked to support their approach to the management of diet related disease with evidence-based guidelines. To date the most recognised form of best evidence is in the RCT, which presents limitations in relation to assessing the effect of dietary intake on the management of chronic disease as demonstrated here. The results of the thesis reported here using a RCT as its basis and made relevant to the &amp;quote real world &amp;quote through the collection of naturalistic practice based evidence, showed that the effects of high amylose RS on the insulin resistance syndrome were equivocal. The reasons for this may be explained in the way in which outcomes were measured and assessed. Results from the preliminary work on the collection of dietary data supported the need for research that studies the way outcomes are measured and assessed. The verbal descriptors used by participants were shown to correlate with their difficulty in reporting accurate food intake. This thesis demonstrates that problematic reporting of caloric intake was typically associated with energy dense foods. As diet-disease relationships need accurate recording of dietary intake to demonstrate cause and effect, qualitative studies such as this are fundamental to improving accurate gathering of energy intake. The methods developed here for identifying accurate reporting and applied to this randomised controlled intervention trial can be used in further trials and applied to clinical practice. Results gained in clinical trials of dietary manipulation need to be able to be reproduced in the real world to have significant outcomes on the incidence of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Hence, to establish the evidence for practice in medical nutrition therapy information from both objective scientific2 research and naturalistic3 observations have been collected and analysed. Holistic patient care is necessary if individuals are to adapt recommended dietary guidelines to their modern lifestyle. Despite limitations in the relatively short duration of the RCT presented here, it serves as a template to analyse the outcomes of dietary intervention in the long term. To prove RS as a therapeutic dietary agent in the control of risk factors for the insulin resistance syndrome, further investigations using combined methodologies are indicated. Well-recognised confounders in human based research vastly dictate the challenge in establishing sound evidence-based practice. These aspects reflect the reality of human variability, the need for individualised therapies and the existence of lifestyle derived confounders such as diet and activity levels and the problems associated with gathering information on these factors. The challenges raised form the ambiance for this thesis, taking the theoretical position that establishing the evidence from a dietetic perspective must draw on the scientific and naturalist dichotomies in the research context. Current human research does not commonly combine these modalities of analysis. The RCT is positioned as high-level evidence, yet inadequately captures less tangible attributes of human variability that naturalistic research can identify. The reductionist approach enforced by a RCT does not detect or accommodate for non-quantifiable and often significant personal environmental barriers to individual adoption of recommended lifestyle modifications. However, non-RCT forms of research are often perceived to be insufficient in rigor and robustness to base clinical practice upon. The RCT, the accepted design for establishing evidence based practice, is of limited value on its own. This is because the extent of human variability from both biological and social influences makes it difficult for studies of a size feasible in practice to produce definitive results where biological outcomes are tested. Evidence based practice would benefit from research that includes both qualitative and quantitative methodologies so that practitioners have a range of information on which to base their decisions. This thesis hypothesises that researchers should provide naturalist evidence in a complimentary fashion when researching diet-disease relationships with more widely accepted scientific (positivist) high-level evidence such as the RCT for appropriate integration into clinical practice. This hypothesis is tested through a RCT complimented by observational naturalistic research. The diet-disease relationship chosen for this comparison and testing was carbohydrate manipulation in an overweight insulin resistant population.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stormwater impacts on discharge water quality in licensed drains at the Port Kembla Steelworks</field><field name="creator">Whant, Louis Mathew</field><field name="description">This study encompassed work on four of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) licensed discharge points at the Port Kembla Steelworks (PKSW). These included the North Gate Drain, the Main Drain, the Flat Products East No.1 Drain and the Ironmaking East Drain. This study incorporated a hydrological study of the drains, and a stormwater discharge water quality study. The aims of the hydrological component were: to obtain an understanding of the behaviour of each of these drains during rainfall events; to determine fractions of runoff compared to rainfall volume; to determine the influence antecedent precipitation has on the discharge of each drain; and, to relate the findings to catchment type. The aims of the water quality component were: to determine the concentrations of priority pollutants in licensed drains during wet weather and the first flush; to determine the likely source of any stormwater borne contaminants; and, to use the water quality data to determine appropriate wet weather licence limits. These aims were developed to assist in the design of further investigations involving stormwater management at PKSW. This study encompassed 16 months of stormwater monitoring and involved the collection of over 1300 samples. The findings were that Flat Products East No.1 Drain and Iron Making East Drain displayed very similar characteristics during rainfall events. Both exhibit 'flashy' hydrographs, with fast response to rainfall, and steep recession curves where return to 'baseline' or process flow is rapid. The fraction of discharge compared to total rainfall volume (falling on the catchment) for both these drains was high (&amp;gt80%). Their small catchments, containing almost entirely sealed impervious surfaces, led to very small water losses. The Flat Products East No.1 Drain and Iron Making East Drain discharge volumes, during rainfall, were found to be unaffected by antecedent rainfall. The Main Drain was found to have a delayed response to rainfall. The Main Drain and the North Gate Drain hydrographs displayed slow receding recession curves where the elevated flow continued for hours after the rainfall events had ceased. The fraction of discharge compared to total rainfall volume (falling on the catchment) for the Main Drain was found to be small, indicating large water losses to infiltration and percolation to groundwater recharge via the relatively large grassed and unsealed, pervious areas within the catchment. An anomaly was found in this fraction for the North Gate Drain due to overestimations in discharge rates from online monitoring equipment and it is recommended this be rectified. Both the Main Drain and North Gate Drain discharge volumes were shown to be affected by antecedent rainfall conditions. The program for the water quality component of this study, specifically targeted the water quality of the 'first flush', sampling every ten minutes during a storm event. The intensive sampling program allowed for the collection of a diverse wet weather data set not investigated previous to this study. The data showed that pollutant concentrations during wet weather are elevated compared to the historical dry weather water quality data. Confidence limits were calculated and compared to current wet weather licence limits. In some cases, the current wet weather licence limits are inadequate, and recommendations have been made for the revision of wet weather licence limits using the calculated 95% CL as a basis. This study identified areas were there are contaminant issues during wet weather, e.g., the Main Drain Total Suspended Solids (major component coal) and the Flat Products East No.1 Drain Total Iron (major component iron prills), and also areas where there are no current drain issues during wet weather (North Gate Drain). Monitoring of pH at all specified drains in this study did not identify any pH excursions during wet weather and no evidence of elevated pH in stormwater runoff was identified. However, further monitoring will be required at North Gate Drain after the removal of current saltwater discharge. This study, whilst specific and extensive, is limited to only four licensed discharge points at PKSW. Extrapolating the findings of this report to the remaining licensed discharge points is not recommended due to vast differences between catchments across the PKSW site, including their size, land usage, plant, associated equipment, activities and salinity. Instead it is recommended that a similar study be commenced on the remaining nine licensed drains.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The agglomeration of fine iron particles in a fluidised bed cascade</field><field name="creator">Blundell, Daniel Laurence</field><field name="description">The research topic presented here is that of the tendency of iron ore particles in a fluidized bed reactor during the DRI process, to form agglomerates, giving rise to sticking of iron ore particles resulting in the defluidisation of fluidised bed iron ore reactors. The particles are capable of sticking to one another, to reactor walls, and to adhere to the interior of standpipes, as they pass from one reactor bed to another. The general mechanism of the agglomeration of fine iron ore particles is by sintering. A study of the sticking of iron ore particles has been conducted by delineating the sub-mechanisms involved in sintering such as van der Waal's adhesion and surface diffusion, and endeavouring to quantify these attributes for iron. In this study, van der Waal's forces and the work of adhesion for iron surfaces in contact has been evaluated using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the pressure exerted at a local infinitesimal point on one iron particle by another was higher than the yield stress of iron and probably leads to plastic deformation of the surface, giving rise to large contact areas between them. In this study, a new and more efficient technique of quantifying surface diffusion rates in metals has been developed using confocal microscopy and ion beam milling. Surface diffusion rates in iron were measured and benchmarked against earlier quantities. The new quantities compared well with the old values, considering the difficulty involved in repeating surface diffusion experiments. It was found that quantities of carbon higher than 0.5%C led to a 100-fold decrease in surface diffusion rates. It is concluded that high carbon content will retard the transport of iron material to a contact site between two particles. A high-temperature sticking test was developed in this study to test and quantify observations made at BHP-Billiton. It was found that in commercial carbon-steel conforming to a carbon content of approximately 0.8%C, a distinct difference exists between sticking quantities of contacts made below and above the eutectoid temperature. Sticking stress was observed to be higher above the eutectoid temperature and it is inferred that the gamma phase of iron is highly susceptible to sticking. This is in contrast to the high carbon steel. It is shown here that Fe-1.5%C steel shows less potential to stick. Iron powders from port Hedland showing minimal sticking are covered in a thin layer of cementite. Thus, the low sticking strength of the high carbon steel is probably due to its content of cementite. Sintering diagrams were constructed for iron to study the combined effect of surface diffusion and van der Waal's adhesion between iron particles. Two main insights were gained from this. Firstly, the potential to form inter-particle contacts via van der Waal's adhesion were not constant with temperature and would vary according to the change in plastic yield strength. It was found that over all that inter-particle contacts grew larger with increasing temperature. Secondly, van der Waal's adhesive properties were more significant when operating on smaller sub-micron particle contacts. In larger particles, the formation of inter-particle contacts relies more of the rates of surface diffusion.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical and adhesive properties of some materials made by 'Click' chemistry</field><field name="creator">Le Baut, Nicolas</field><field name="description">The aim of this work is to examine the physical and adhesive properties of a number of crosslinked polymers made by &amp;quote click &amp;quote chemistry, a technique, that has been explored thus far only in the context of drug discovery. The polymers were synthesised between copper and brass plates. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were used to measure the glass transition temperature (Tg) of these materials. The polymers were found to have unusually high Tg values, sometimes up to 60oC higher than the curing temperature, depending on the cure time. The adhesives properties of these materials on brass substrates have also been examined using a fracture mechanics test, the double cantilever beam test (DCB). The adhesion was found to be very similar (sometimes higher) than that of some commercial epoxy systems. Finally, the copper-polymer interface was characterized using the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique. SERS showed the presence of a triazole-based compound adsorbed on copper. The adhesion strength of these &amp; quote click &amp; quote polymers on copper substrates is believed to be function of the formation of the triazole-copper complex.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/470</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tense relations: the tradition of Hoshi and emergence of Borantia in Japan</field><field name="creator">Georgeou, Nichole</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the transformations of volunteering in Japan from 'h&#333;shi' (mutual obligation) to 'borantia' (borrowed from the English 'volunteer'). I argue changes in the forms of volunteering overtime point to important shifts in state-citizen and state-civil society relations in Japan. H&#333;shi emerged during a period of Japan's history when the state had an increasingly authoritarian approach to managing its subjects. It reflects this cultural context as it embodies a strong sense of obligation and is characterised by notions of service and sacrifice, particularly dedicated service to the greater good of the Emperor and state. In contrast the concept of borantia is associated with free will and social contribution. Borantia has had a tremendous impact on the way Japanese citizens view civil society. Its emergence marked a change in popular consciousness about the role of citizen's vis-a-vis the state and departure from Japan's traditional form of volunteering (h&#333;shi) which has connotations of obligation to the state and Emperor. First appearing in the 1960s and 1970s, the word 'borantia' was used to describe residents' and citizens' movements. After the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of January 1995 the notion of borantia was propelled into popular public consciousness leading to the enactment of The Law to Promote Specified Non-Profit Activities (NPO Law). This represented a significant landmark in state-citizen/state civil society relations. However, the effectiveness of the Law to enable an autonomous civil society has been impeded by traditionally low corporate and individual giving, as well as a reliance on the state for funding. Tension remains in Japan because the old systems and practices that supported h&#333;shi remain along side new systems and practices that led to the emergence and proliferation of borantia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a subband model for blind signal separation in an acoustic environment</field><field name="creator">Russell, Iain Trent</field><field name="description">The focus of this thesis is to develop a framework for solving convolutively mixed blind signal separation problems in the subband domain. Current methods generally employ a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to change the time domain convolutive model into many instantaneous multiplicative models to save on computations and convergence time. The motivation for approaching the problem from the subband domain is that there is an upper bound on the quality of separation for frequency domain methods where the mixing is done in a reverberant environment and there is a high number of unknown variables to solve for. This is shown with reference to the works in (S. Araki, S. Makino, T. Nishikawa, and H. Saruwatari, 2001; M. Ikram, and D. Morgan, 2000; R. Mukai, S. Araki, H. Sawada, and S. Makino, 2004). The model is developed throughout the thesis in a series of stages. Firstly we investigate modelling the convolutive Blind Signal Separation (BSS) problem completely in the time domain. The benefit of this is that by not performing any transforms we eliminate the local frequency permutation problem that is inherent in all convolutive BSS problems. To solve the permutation problem requires additional computational overhead. There is a tradeoff however according to how complex the mixing/demixing system is. The longer the reverberation time of an acoustic environment, the more unknown variables must be solved. The savings of performing multiplication in the frequency domain as opposed to convolution in the time domain must be compared to the savings of not doing the transform operator twice, as well as ensuring the local Vll Abstract permutation problem is solved.Two new algorithms that avoid the local permutation problem are proposed and investigated. The first uses an alternating least squares approach (ALS) while the second uses joint diagonalization of output correlation matrices of the recovered signals. Where it is plausible to assume that we have some sort of a priori information that provides a good initial starting point for the unknown demixing system, then we only need to consider some type of local optimization procedure to solve the unknown demixing system. Two local optimization procedures investigated include the steepest gradient descent and Newton methods. Both types of local solvers were compared and the merits and disadvantages of each are specified in regards to the convolutive BSS time domain algorithm proposed. Where small convolutive mixing systems exist, such as in wireless communication mixing systems that assume a two ray model, the computational overhead that is increased by doing convolution in the time domain is offset more by the savings of not havmg to solve the local permutation problem and execute the transform operation.In some cases, information pertaining to problem is unavailable. Geometric source separation assumes that there is some additional knowledge about the layout of the sensors WIth spatial reference to the source positions. This allows an angle of incidence of the sound wave impinging on the sensor array to either be known directly or calculated using various beamforming techniques. If we cannot assume to know such information, then multivariate complex problems with a high number of parameters become harder to solve for without getting spurious results from ill-convergence to local multiminima as opposed to the preferred global minima which corresponds to the desired demixing system that will allow signal separation. To avoid this, we integrate one of the proposed time domain convolutive BSS algorithms with a global optimization routine that is catered to suit the BSS convolutive problem model. A Abstract ix branch and bound algorithm that uses division by hyper-rectangles is used to solve the uninitialized optimization BSS problem. With the validity of the proposed BSS time domain convolutive algorithm and the global optimization approach being justified, attention will then be focused on integrating these contributions into a model which uses subband decomposition before performing signal separation. Various methods of subband decomposition are considered including using a uniform FIR analysis/synthesis filter bank based on DFT modulation as well as cosine modulation. The prototype window used is based on an extended lapped transform and was chosen due to the computational benefits of using lapped transforms. A framework for developing such a subband model is made with the main aspects of the model being the BSS algorithm and optimization approaches used, the way in which the observed signals from a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) mixing system are decomposed via a filter bank, and the way in which the local permutation problem is overcome. In our work we propose a new subband detection, correction, and sorting routine for separated but arbitrarily permuted subbands over the entire spectrum.Finally, a general and systematic approach for obtaining experimental measurements for generating the impulse response of an acoustic environment such as a typical office room, as well as the inverting MIMO system using wiener-hopf and optImal filtering theory is presented to allow full availability of information for the problem modelled in a practical environment as opposed to synthetic testing methods which are also examined.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Travelling writing, writing travelling: the text as journey, the journey as text</field><field name="creator">Borthwick, John</field><field name="description">Travelling Writing, Writing Travelling travels the writing which writes of travelling. This thesis is seen as an investigative journey itself, while journeys are seen as resembling texts. Part One's point of departure is to question several expectations of formal thesis-writing. The paper proposes that in travel narratives (a) some constituent discourses cluster around 'the quest' as theme and structuring device; and (b) the quest has two dimensions, inner and outer.Part Two, 'Travelling Writing' covers broad issues in travel literature: metaphors of 'journey as text' and 'text as journey'; genre, definition, variations and fiction; travelling in general and travellers (adventurers, anthropologists, explorers, tourists, nomads, women travellers). Travel writers are discussed, as is 'an incomplete history' of travel writing, with attention to Romanticism, American, and British work.In Part Three, 'Writing Travelling' several major constituent discourses of travel narratives are examined: the Diary, Autobiography, the Other (in terms of imperialism, place, tourism, topography), Exoticism (as spectacle, erotica, nostalgia, anthropology, tourism, etc.), and the Quest (sublime quest, myth, and the double quest).Part Four, 'Australian Travel Writing,' considers aspects of 'writing Australia,' Aboriginality, the Outback and accounts by Australian authors. Seven Australian travel narratives - one per decade, 1920s to 1980s - are discussed at length and in relation to the five nominated constituent discourses and the 'double quest' narrative. The texts are interrogated as follows: Who are the heroes of this work? What are they doing here? What is the nature of the outer and inner search? Are the various goals achieved? Is there a 'narrative quest' involving the textual representation of reality? Is the reader required to actively negotiate meaning and text?The Conclusion summanses the answers to the above questions, and evaluates the earlier propositions. Within the limited sample of Australian texts the constituent discourses are seen to cluster around 'the quest,' with their quests having inner and outer dimensions supported to varying extents by those discourses. Discussion of the idea of 'the travel writer as shaman,' in terms of that writer's analogous role of 'messenger between two worlds,' concludes but does not end this text's journey.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the Internet in the primary school classroom</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Chris</field><field name="description">Computer related technology is increasingly used in society today, and has impacted in various ways on classrooms across the world. In New South Wales, Australia, there has been an increasing emphasis on teaching using information and communication technology (ICT), and in particular the Internet. Previous research has suggested that few teachers are significantly integrating ICT into their class teaching and learning activities (Oberg &amp; Gibson, 1999; Robertson, Grady, Fluck, &amp; Webb, 2006). This study has investigated how the Internet was used to support teaching and learning in primary school classrooms. Case study methodology was used for the study to provide an in depth view of how some teachers have integrated the use of the Internet into their classroom teaching and learning activities. Data for this study were collected from four public primary schools in New South Wales, during one ten week school term. The study focused on students in Years 3 to 6 in five classes as well as on their class teachers. The study found that while all of the teachers used the Internet to some degree to support teaching and learning activities in the classroom this was done in various ways and with varying success. In particular, ICT infrastructure, access and use varied between classes and schools. Also of importance were the pedagogical aspects of integrating Internet technology into the classroom teaching program. The implications stemming from this research include the need to offer more professional development on how to integrate ICT into class teaching for teachers as well as providing them with ready access to online resources and adequate ICT infrastructure.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of Economic Globalisation on Human Rights in Australia's Foreign Policy : A Case Study of East Timor</field><field name="creator">Koizumi, Hiromi</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore the complex relationships between Australia's approaches to human rights (HR) and to globalisation. This thesis examines the ways in which global economic activity, otherwise called economic globalisation, has influenced or determined Australia's foreign policy with regards to HR. This research investigates the complex relationships between Australia's Human Rights in its foreign policy and globalisation since the 1970s, by exploring the interaction between ongoing globalisation and Australian foreign policy. Its central argument is that Australia's foreign policy with regards to HR has been compromised by globalisation in the pursuit of its own national economic interests. Australia's lack of morality under its foreign policy has failed to take a state's moral obligation with regard to human rights, as international human rights principles and agreements require. This thesis critically analyses a nexus between the support and promotion of the HR approaches of Australian foreign policies since the 1970s on the one hand, and Australia's enthusiastic embrace of economic globalisation, on the other. It is argued that Australian foreign policy has been aimed at establishing an approach toward globalisation which gives priority to national business interests. This has resulted in inconsistent approaches to HR, especially with regards to Australia's nearest neighbour, East Timor. By exploring approaches of Australian Governments with regards to HR, especially some maritime boundary treaties of the Timor Sea that Australia has conducted and concluded, this thesis examines and shows the way in which Australian foreign policy has been shaped by economic global views, which in turn have had increasingly adverse effects on its international human rights policies. The case study of Australia's policies on East Timor reveal increasing inconsistency between HR principles and actions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of household footwear-surface interactions on the gait of older arthritic females</field><field name="creator">Munro, Bridget J</field><field name="description">Inappropriate footwear, poor footwear-surface interactions and gait adaptations resulting from musculoskeletal problems, such as arthritis and foot problems, are all factors that contribute to home slips. However, no research was located which identified the effects of interactions between household footwear and household surface characteristics on variables that may predispose older individuals to fall in the home. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to identify how different household shoe-surface interactions affected the gait of older people, particularly those with foot problems, to recommend a &#8220;safe&#8221; household shoe for older people. To achieve this purpose, this thesis was completed in two experimental sections. Experimental Section A comprised surveying 60 men and 68 women aged 65 years and above who lived independently in the community to identify the requirements and attitudes of older people living independently in the community in relation to their household footwear wearing and purchasing habits. Statistical analyses were conducted using chi-square tests, independent t-tests and z-scores to determine whether any relationships existed between the variables as well as the effects of gender. The main health condition reported by both men (37%) and women (50%) was arthritis. Women reported significantly more foot problems (2.3 per woman) than men (1.4 per man) as well as significantly greater foot pain and/or discomfort (59% women, 45% men). Furthermore, a greater number of women (25%) had fallen in the 12 months before the survey compared to men (17%). Shoes were worn in and around the house by 79% respondents, with the most popular household shoe type being the slipper, with 56% respondents indicating they wore both closed back and toe slippers around the home. The type of household shoe worn was significantly related to gender such that women predominantly wore closure-free, non-rigid household shoe types compared to men who tended to wear shoes with closures around the home. Only 30% of respondents did not wear household shoes, with most walking barefoot around the home (89.5%). The most slippery surface reported was that of smooth tiles (40.6%) with several respondents indicating they felt uneasy on wet surfaces, particularly tiles. It was concluded that Experimental Section B should focus upon the walking patterns displayed by older rheumatoid arthritic (RA) females when wearing toe and closed back slippers and walking on typical household surfaces, particularly wet surfaces. Experimental Section B examined the effects of household footwear-surface interactions on the biomechanical parameters characterising initial foot-ground contact, as this phase of the gait cycle most commonly results in slips. Subjective perceptions, kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular data were collected at initial foot-ground contact as eight community-dwelling older women with RA and eight matched controls walked at a self-selected pace along a 6 m walkway under three footwear conditions (barefoot, closed back slippers, toe slippers) and three surface conditions (carpet, dry vinyl tile, wet vinyl tile). Mixed repeated measures three-way ANOVA were then completed to determine whether subject group, shoe type or surface type significantly (p &#8804; 0.05) influenced the gait patterns at initial foot-ground contact. Compared to the control subjects, RA subjects displayed similar activity levels, segmental proportionality and plantar sensation, although increased foot pain and knee flexibility, decreased knee and ankle muscle strength and altered static and dynamic plantar pressure patterns. Despite displaying similar gait characteristics, the RA subjects estimated the walking trials to be significantly more difficult and experienced significantly more pain compared to the control subjects. The within-footwear main effects revealed that when subjects walked in toe slippers they found them to be uncomfortable and slippery, requiring significantly altered muscle activation patterns (earlier vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PL) onset; earlier gastrocnemius (G) offset; longer PL duration; increased TA intensity) compared to walking in closed back slippers. Within-footwear changes to muscle activation strategies (earlier rectus femoris (RF), VL and PL onset; earlier G offset; longer biceps femoris duration; decreased TA intensity) and kinetic profiles (decreased peak vertical and anteroposterior braking forces) were also evident when subjects walked barefoot compared to walking shod. Furthermore, the within-surface main effects indicated that when subjects walked on the wet vinyl-tile surface, they perceived the surface as more slippery, more difficult to walk upon and less comfortable, requiring significantly altered muscle activation patterns (later RF offset; earlier TA offset; longer RF duration; shorter VL duration; increased RF and semitendinosus (S) intensity), kinetic profiles (decreased peak anteroposterior braking forces) and kinematic profiles (decreased foot/shoe angle and angular velocity). Interestingly, footwear x surface interactions indicated that the subjects displayed significantly altered movement control strategies (longer RF and G duration; increased RF, VL and S intensity; decreased anteroposterior braking forces and foot/shoe angular velocity) and subjective perceptions (increased task difficulty and shoe/surface slipperiness; decreased shoe comfort) when subjects walked barefoot on the wet vinyl tile surface compared to all other conditions. It was concluded that older women, particularly those with RA should wear closed back slippers, in preference to toe slippers, around the home, to reduce their incidence of foot pain and/or discomfort as well as to reduce their slip risk at initial foot-ground contact, particularly when walking on slippery surfaces. Further research is recommended to determine whether the prescription of closed back slippers, considered to be &#8220;safe&#8221; in the present thesis, does in fact reduce falls, particularly slips, in the homes of older women</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial liberalisation in Sri Lanka: an econometric analysis</field><field name="creator">Paudel, Ramsh Chandra</field><field name="description">This study examines the impact of financial liberalisation on macroeconomic issues such as saving, investment, financial performance, financial sector widening, gross domestic product, and the money demands of Sri Lanka over the time series annual data from 1963 to 2005. Financial liberalisation in Sri Lanka commenced in since 1977 with most of the effort being made up to 1995. This study is based on empirical analysis using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) base Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach of cointegration, and includes a causality test. This study contributes primarily where an evaluation of financial liberalisation impacts the financial liberalisation index as a proxy of financial liberalisation. The financial liberalisation index has been constructed with 13 policy instruments for its phase of implementation in the Sri Lankan economy. The unit root tests were conducted by applying the DF (Dickey-Fuller), ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and PP (Phillips-Perron) methods. The cointegration tests were conducted to find out the long-run relationship among the variables concerned, and the ECM (Error Correction Model) version of ARDL was applied to test the speed of adjustment to equilibrium. The empirical test results suggest that financial liberalisation in Sri Lanka has a mixed impact in the short term. The average population per bank branch, real interest rates, and real gross domestic product are key variables for widening the financial sector, while real gross domestic product was also a significant contributor towards widening the financial sector, which shows that economic growth fosters the country's financial sectors. The results showed that financial liberalisation did not widen the financial sector in the long term although it did in the short term through income led interest rates, savings, and investments. The results also show that financial liberalisation did not improve the financial performance of the economy, as was expected. Our results reveal that financial liberalisation cannot by itself enhance economic growth in Sri Lanka unless followed by proper strategies with suitable sequential procedures. The relationship between real narrow money and real broad money demand is studied with the conclusion being that the real lending rate has a significantly positive association while financial liberalisation has a significantly negative association within the narrow money demand over the long term. With broad money, the real gross domestic product and real lending rate are the key variables that have a positive association with the demand for broad money. Financial liberalisation has a significantly negative impact which means that an expansion in the demand for money is possible if economic growth is enhanced, which in turn increases real income, not by financial liberalisation as it has occurred. This study found that in Sri Lanka the one-way causal relationship between economic growth and financial performance, based on the empirical results, showed that economic growth causes financial development and financial performance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bio- and pedogeochemical investigations in Southern Australia : implications for mineral exploration and environmental assessment</field><field name="creator">Hemmati  Ahoei, Hamid Reza</field><field name="description">Leaves, twigs and bark of six different mallee species (Eucalyptus oleosa, E. gracilis, E. socialis, E. eremophila, E. transcontinentalis and E. diversifolia) and their adjacent soils have been collected from 94 sites in up to nine botanical regions spread over a wide area in southern Australia.

Some trace elements have higher contents from biosamples growing on substrates with powdery calcretes than either nodular or hardpan, suggesting that vegetation may more easily take up the species of trace elements that are dissolved in these regolith carbonates or it may arise from the influence of bedrock. The biological absorption coefficient (BAC), which is one of the biogeochemical parameters used in mineral exploration, was produced to characterize the absorption of chemical elements by plants from their substrate. It was concluded that the plants studied here have BAC values for trace metals higher than the average values cited in the literature and pose their eligibility for inclusion in regional biogeochemical exploration programs.Pedo- and biogeochemical patterns based on the results of exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and robust-class selection was applied to the analysis of data. Regional biogeochemical maps of As, Au, Co, Cr, Mn and Ni show an association of these elements coincident with known mineralisation, and delineate anomalous sites where no mineralization is reported.Several sampling sites were located directly over and adjacent to the Menninnie Dam zinc-lead prospect. The high levels of some trace elements, especially Zn at this site, are reflected in the chemical composition of all biological sample types.Concerning environmental aspects, plants contributed very little to arsenic diffusion, cycling and transfer from soil and atmosphere to the biosphere in the study areas, since comparison of washed and unwashed plant parts in several sites throughout the area displays no significant decreases in the assay values for washed samples and subtle differences between these two series of samples could be within the range of the natural variation.Generally, the Cr concentrations found in the study area do not exceed the recommended contaminated level for soils related to ecosystems (210 ppm), except for 11 of the 81 sites investigated, which are located in the Yilgarn Craton near areas of known mineralisation in ultrabasic rocks. The concentration of Co and Ni in the soil samples of this research do not exceed the recommended guideline (40 ppm and 600 ppm, respectively).This multi-elemental reconnaissance study has enabled us to get invaluable information about the natural concentrations of chemical elements in this substrate and to contribute to a baseline bio-soil geochemical survey established against which future changes can be quantified and to recognise new potential areas for mineral prospecting.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marginal analysis of a distribution model designed to increase the social welfare function of Medicare-funded diagnostic services</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Keith</field><field name="description">The pursuit of a more beneficial service mix in primary medical care is a worthwhile public goal. Public expenditure on diagnostic testing referred from general practice is a matter of public interest because of its potential benefit to the social welfare function. To realise this potential, interventions must first reflect the evidence-base for enhancing clinical quality and promote discretionary increases in certain interventions (Eddy 1994[b] p.817; Rodwin 2004 p. 1328; Starfield 1998 p.406; Van Weel &amp; Del Mar 2004 p.99). The effectiveness of primary care however is stratified by social class (Macinko, Starfield &amp; Shi 2007 p.121; Starfield 1998 p.411). Therefore, services must also take into consideration any access barriers for vulnerable social groups and demonstrate a positive commitment to addressing the imbalance (Starfield 1998 p.406).In practice, good clinical or scientific evidence alone is insufficient to achieve the optimum distribution of health services. The evidence must be matched by economic viability and sensitivity to the prevailing socio-political imperatives (Haas 2001 p.228; Van Der Weyden &amp; Armstrong 2004 pp.607-608). Planning should explicitly consider marginal opportunities for changes in the balance of costs and benefits (Haas et.al. 1997 p.81). The purpose of this study is to derive a model that levers redistribution of general practitioner-referred diagnostic services in favour of vulnerable social groups within Australia. The study operates within the boundaries of the dominant disease-state paradigm, because it focuses on systematically addressing nationally-prioritised epidemiological indicators for targeted populations. The derived model relies on intermediaries representing groupings of general practices to drive the redistribution. It establishes an environment of nominal risk for the Divisions of General Practice network, acting as intermediaries. In turn, the actual risk to the Australian Government as the purchaser is limited to public funding through the Medicare Benefits Schedule of general practitioner-referred medical imaging (Category 5 [excluding Group I5]) and pathology tests (Category 6). This is achieved by introducing a credit reserve ledger as a novel mechanism to track and reward Division performance. The ledger is a tool for the Australian Government to map the balance of benefits claimed on diagnostic services referred by general practitioners enrolled with each Division. Ledger balances depend on a separation of medical imaging and pathology items into three streams. The systematic streaming of items is according to whether they are over-, appropriately- or under-referred, according to the available evidence. The key for Divisions to draw on their credit reserve ledger is the proportionate uptake of the evidence-based target items by identified vulnerable social groups within their catchment. This is compared with a target level of activity set for these groups to establish a specific performance ratio for each financial period. The research design of this study tests the model&#8217;s effectiveness in the current health care environment, rather than its theoretical efficacy. The model acknowledges Australia&#8217;s current legislative and policy framework and its communities&#8217; over-arching socio-political imperatives. No presumptions are made about changing the Medicare Benefits Schedule or its predominant fee-for-service mode of delivery. The redistribution model is tested using a series of scenarios, and analysed in three parts. In the first part a macro-level analysis examines the net implications of the redistribution for the Australian Government, Divisions of General Practice and diagnostic providers as a whole across four different scenarios. In the second part, a meso-level analysis uses the existing Divisions&#8217; network in a further three scenarios. Normative projections are developed across categories of geographic dispersion for each of the given scenarios. Thirdly, a micro-level analysis examines the absolute values of projected credit reserves within the same scenarios as the meso-level analysis for each of the Divisions.The model results in a 0.02% increase in total tests with a 2.2% reduction in the total of benefits claimed. Within this ideal redistribution, there is an 18.4% reduction in uptake of over-referred items, a modelled 0.8% growth in uptake of appropriately referred items, and a substantial growth in uptake of the targeted, under-referred items (activity by 84.9% and benefits claimed by 94.2%). The meso-level analysis demonstrates that the model has a defining normative bias in favour of increasing rurality and remoteness. This is consistent with the model&#8217;s aim of delivering supply-side incentives to service vulnerable social groups. The meso-level results also indicate that a staged implementation of the model is required. This is because the overwhelming majority of Australia&#8217;s population live within the more metropolitan and regional Divisions that require the greatest effort to glean benefit from the model. Initially, they may be the most difficult to engage. At the micro-level, the model is tested on estimated parameters matched to one-hundred and nineteen Divisions of General Practice. The result is that all the Divisions of General Practice within the existing network have sufficient critical mass to accumulate a material benefit from participation.  The study acknowledges that limitations in the model design may risk perverse incentives and unintended aberrations. For this reason, the model requires the protection of a regulatory framework to ensure its proper application in the field. Based on implementation experience, refinements may be required over time to reduce any unintended consequences. There are limitations to the study design which give cause for further investigation and testing in the field. The analyses rely on secondary data, which risks artefacts within the results. Further, this is a study of marginal costs and benefits, rather than a true cost-effectiveness analysis because the utilisation targets used are interim measures of process, and not definitive measures of change in health status. Finally, this study is also limited by its inability to test the model against the actual parameters from identified Divisions of General Practice. The study concludes that the model undergo further investigation and field testing in order to derive empirical results. It is also recommended that future studies test the generalisability of the model, with research into the redistribution modelling of general practice prescriptions and referrals to specialists for elective procedures. The consistent aim is to achieve marginal redistribution in the pursuit of an enhanced social welfare function.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of lepton contamination in high energy x-ray beams</field><field name="creator">Damrongkijudom, Nyanpen</field><field name="description">The objectives of this study were to improve our understanding of the contamination arising in conventional radiotherapy treatment from the various principal processes involved. The evolution of the contamination was investigated in two main ways: i) experimental measurements; and ii) the Monte Carlo method. The magnetic field strengths in this improved design were intended to result in more uniform magnetic flux densities in the area of interest, with the prediction of a greater volume where the electron contamination was effectively removed by our magnetic deflector device. The magnetic field strengths obtained by the magnetic deflector will theoretically give rise to electron deflection radii that should cause the majority of electron contamination to exit the treatment field. An enhancement of the electron dose was never experimentally observed in the irradiated area, and a percentage reduction of the skin and subcutaneous dose up to 34% with the NdFeB magnetic device was seen for a 20 x 20 cm2 field size. The elimination of significant electron doses due to contaminant electrons down to a depth of a few millimetres was obtained with this newly designed magnetic deflector device. In the study, the experiments were verified by an Attix chamber and radiographic film. The surface dose was increased as the field size was increased in an open field and when a Perspex tray was placed in the beam, with the increase especially significant in the case where there was both a Perspex tray and a larger field size. The Perspex tray or a wedge filter eliminate secondary electrons and generate new electrons at the same time, however, when combined with magnetic field the surface dose is reduced significantly. Results are also shown for the surface dose profile in two dimensions (x and y-axis) with the surface dose showing a decrease at all sites within the treatment field due to the magnetic deflector device, not only for an open field, but also when a wedge or a Perspex tray is in the beam. Calculation and analysis of spectra of deflected electrons in photon beams from the linear accelerator treatment head were investigated. Calculating such spectra with more accuracy requires knowledge of the characteristics of the electron beam incident on the target as well as better equipment for modelling the linear accelerator. We used the Monte Carlo method performed with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc code to derive estimates for the average energy deposited in the system. Monte Carlo modelling of photon beams was achieved and adjusted for two parameters: AE = ECUT = 0.521 MeV and AE = ECUT = 0.700 MeV by matching the Monte Carlo calculated depth dose and beam profile data with the measured data. The capability of the Monte Carlo program in evaluating dose distribution has been verified by comparison with measurements in a water phantom and with radiographic film. The comparisons were performed for percentage of the build-up dose for various field sizes. Ionisation measurements were made in a solid water phantom by means of an Attix chamber for experiments to determine the dose in the build-up region. The measurement of skin dose uses an Attix parallel plate ionisation chamber, which is primarily used as the benchmark chamber in solid-water phantom dose build-up measurements. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to generate data to predict the dose distribution for 6 MV x-rays. Investigation of dose components of electron spectra are compared between calculated and measured dose distributions. From the Monte Carlo calculations and measurements on the surface and in the build-up region for 6 MV x-ray beams based on our results, we conclude that our optimised simulation model represents the beam emerging from the treatment head and the calculated percentage depth doses in such a way that there is a satisfactory match with the experimental measurements for the same irradiation set-ups.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social impact of using automatic identification technologies and location-based services in national security</field><field name="creator">Tootell, Holly</field><field name="description">This study seeks to explore the use of automatic identification technologies (auto-ID) and location-based services (LBS) in national security initiatives. Public awareness of national security has increased significantly since the terrorist attacks in the United States of America on 11 September 2001. Location-based services require technologies such as radio frequency identification, the global positioning system, and biometric identification, to provide applications such as immigration and visa control functions to advanced home-detention. Location applications have the potential to be privacy insensitive and pervasive. These potential traits need to be balanced with benefits that the technologies offer. Critical Social Theory (CST) is the lens through which motivations of government and public perception have been examined. CST allows the issue of auto-ID and LBS adoption for national security to be studied by examining events of national security significance through public reaction as documented in popular media. For future advancement of government-driven solutions to national security threats and preparations, it is imperative that current research look beyond the technology-based solutions to develop a greater awareness of their implications. The aim of this research is to provide insight into the use of auto-ID and location-based services in national security in order to understand how social aspects of technology can impact lifeworld perception of the use of the technology. The research has achieved this aim through a review of the literature in the field of auto-ID and LBS intersecting with the social implications of technology. This intersection has identified social shaping factors of recent national security events which have contributed to the investigation of recent national security events to establish the social context in which auto-ID and LBS technology is being used. A paradigm for understanding and discovering the proposed impact of future auto-ID and LBS applications being used in national security has been established and is referred to as the PSL (Privacy, Security, Liberty) Trichotomy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions of metal complexes with DNA</field><field name="creator">Talib, Jihan</field><field name="description">Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), absorption spectrophotometry and circular dichroism spectroscopy were used to investigate the non-covalent binding interactions of the nickel complexes [Ni(phen)2(L)]Cl2, (L = phen, dpq ,dpqc and dppz) with the 16mer oligonucleotide D2, which has the following base sequence: (GCTGCCAAATACCTCC/GGAGGTATTTGGCAGC). In addition, the extent of unwinding of the negatively supercoiled plasmid pUC9 caused by the nickel complexes, and the extent to which they inhibit in vitro synthesis of mRNA, were investigated using gel electrophoresis. The results of these studies showed that DNA binding strengthened as the size of the unique ligand was increased. Comparison of each of the above sets of results with those obtained from identical experiments performed using the analogous ruthenium complexes [Ru(phen)2(L)]2+ (L = phen, dpq, dpqc, dppz) showed that varying the metal ion had a measurable effect on DNA binding affinity, with the nickel complexes generally interacting more weakly with D2 than the corresponding ruthenium complexes.ESI-MS/MS and in-source collision-induced dissociation experiments were performed using the tetrameric quadruplex DNA molecule Q5 (TTGGGGGT)4 and antiparallel dimeric quadruplex Q2 (GGGGTTTTGGGG)2 in order to determine their gas-phase dissociation profiles. It was found that the gas phase stability of the quadruplex DNA was dependent on its charge state, the number of oligonucleotide strands that make up the quadruplex, and the number of consecutive G-tetrads that it contains. ESI-MS and circular dichroism spectroscopy were also used to examine the non-covalent binding interactions of the octahedral nickel and ruthenium complexes stated above, as well as several square planar platinum complexes with Q5. The platinum complexes studied were [Pt(en)(phen)]2+, [Pt(en)(3,4,7,8-Me4phen)]2+, [Pt(en)(4,7-Me2phen)]2+ and [Pt(5,6- Me2phen)(S,S-dach)]2+. The results obtained from these experiments showed that each of the three groups of metal complexes were able to bind to Q5. In contrast to what was found in experiments involving the duplex DNA molecule D2, the presence of the intercalating dppz ligand in the coordination sphere of both the nickel and ruthenium complexes did not greatly increase their binding affinity towards quadruplex DNA. This observation suggests that intercalative binding interactions may not play as important a role in the binding of metal complexes to quadruplex DNA. ESI-MS was used to analyse mixtures containing the organic drug daunomycin, Q5, and either [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ or [Pt(en)(4,7-Me2phen)]2+, in order to obtain information about the qDNA binding modes of these metal complexes.  The affinity of the above two metal complexes towards parallel tetrameric quadruplexes  with different lengths was also compared using ESI-MS in an attempt to shed light on whether they bind to the ends of the quadruplexes or in grooves along their lengths.The optimal conditions required to obtain ESI mass spectra of the non-covalent adduct formed between the DNA binding domain of mouse transcription factor PU.1, and a short 10mer DNA molecule containing its 5'-GGAA-3' consensus sequence, were determined. ESI-MS was then used to probe the extent of inhibition of formation of this non-covalent complex caused by addition of [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+ or [Pt(5,6-Me2phen)(S,S-dach)]2+. Both metal complexes were shown to inhibit binding of the transcription factor to its DNA recognition site, demonstrating the potential of these complexes for transcription therapy.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curating inscription: the legacy of textual exhibitions of tattooing in colonial literature</field><field name="creator">Werner, Anne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the colonial context of the tattoo&#8216;s reintroduction to the west, and the exhibitionary nature of its cultural presence in the Euro-American public&#8216;s consciousness, has been mediated and to a degree determined by cultural understandings of processes of exhibition and display. The tattoo&#8216;s role in performances of Otherness has allowed it to be manipulated and utilized by authors who, I argue, &#8215;curate&#8216; their textual artifacts in accordance with the conventions offered by other exhibitionary mediums. The complicated nature of the tattoo&#8216;s relationship with popular cultural representations of colonialism has meant that the reclamation of traditional tattooing, for many cultures, demands an engagement with the colonial histories of representation illuminated in this thesis. Selected texts, including Herman Melville&#8216;s Typee and Omoo, a number of beachcomber narratives, the narratives surrounding the captivity of Olive Oatman, and contemporary representations of Maori in tourist imagery, are examined in order to expose the colonial history of representations of tattooing and the irreversible impact this history has had upon the west&#8216;s conception of &#8215;tattoo&#8216;. The literary analysis focuses upon the concept of the text as exhibition, and the author as curator, and uses theoretical approaches from museum, performance and tourism studies, including work by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Anne Maxwell, Jane Desmond, Tony Bennett and Dean MacCannell to strengthen and nuance the textual readings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family footprints: tracing the past in the present through curatorial autobiographical practice</field><field name="creator">Bourke, Anthony R</field><field name="description">The research is a study of a curatorial development, process and practice over ten years and three exhibitions that culminated in the exhibition Lines in the Sand: Botany Bay Stories from 1770, in 2008.The accompanying written text charts the evolution from a 1998 exhibition Flesh &amp; Blood: A Story of Sydney, 1788-1998 where for the first time I synthesised various strands in my life: my career as a curator in Aboriginal art and relationships with several of the artists, an exploration of my own colonial family history, and a growing interest and expertise in colonial material.Flesh &amp; Blood has been described as a new form of curatorship (see Lawrenson): an exhibition that was both traditional and innovative, in which the past was brought into the present by the juxtaposition of appropriated images, and the weaving of Aboriginal and personal settler narratives for the first time. The inclusion of artworks by Aboriginal artists disrupted a linear European telling of history. The concept I developed for the second exhibition in 2006, EORA: Mapping Aboriginal Sydney, 1770-1850 was to identify and examine where possible the Aborigines dispossessed in those first years of settlement. This was a counterbalance to my family history and provided the opportunity to bring into the public arena the extraordinary scholarship of Keith Vincent Smith, the biographer of King Bungaree and Bennelong. The exhibition demonstrated how much information is now known about the Eora people and provided an opportunity for the Mitchell Library to showcase for the first time their colonial Indigenous material. While curatorially conservative, it was the most comprehensive exhibition of the subject matter ever assembled.In 2006 I also commenced my Masters of Arts by Research at the University of Wollongong in order to examine the third phase of my research: specific encounters between my family and Indigenous people. I started with Philip Gidley King, my maternal great-great-great-great-grandfather, as he was a First Fleeter as Second Lieutenant to Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. Both these men experienced the first encounters with Aboriginal people in Botany Bay and their documentation has provided the official historical record, as the other better known and subsequently published journal writers arrived in Botany Bay several days after them. While I have other encounters to examine between my family and Indigenous people, the events of 1770 and 1788 are so fundamental as foundational narratives, that they have become the entire focus of this thesis.As my reading and written research progressed, the visual images I discovered, or were familiar with, became an indispensable element of the project. With my background as a curator and the variety of visual imagery available, an exhibition emerged as the most effective means of articulating my thesis. Lines in the Sand: Botany Bay Stories from 1770 also evolved into a quest to identify and articulate the Aboriginal perspective and voice, where possible, on the events of 1770 and 1788, and reflected the latest scholarship. The Aboriginal point of view has undoubtedly been best expressed by artists, particularly Gordon Bennett, and a younger generation such as Daniel Boyd and Jonathan Jones. Also incorporated again has been the most recent research of Keith Vincent Smith who has identified or verified several of the Aboriginal participants and eye witnesses of those first encounters. In 2006 I moved to Bundeena in the Sutherland Shire, and was subsequently invited to propose an exhibition for the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre. As the southern shore of Botany Bay is part of the Sutherland Shire, an exhibition about the responses to the events of 1770 and 1788 in Botany Bay was the logical outcome. This provided the opportunity for me to present my ideas and research findings through a curatorial process that had been evolving over ten years. Rather than &#8220;conclusions&#8221;, my curatorial thesis illustrates how many different narratives contribute to a national narrative, and that there are many ways of interpreting and understanding history.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the suitability of RFID anti-collision protocols in energy constrained environments</field><field name="creator">Klair, Dheeraj K</field><field name="description">Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has revolutionized the asset tracking industry, with applications ranging from automated checkout to monitoring the medication intakes of elderlies. Its wide acceptance and applicability has spurred researchers to create novel RFID applications. One promising development is equipping nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with a RFID reader to create a distributed, self-configuring, ad hoc wireless network for tracking objects with an RFID tag.A key problem in RFID-enhanced WSNs is the limited battery life of sensor nodes, which imposes a severe energy constraint on communication protocols.  To put this into perspective, this thesis shows that the energy consumed by an RFID reader to read a single 96-bit tag is higher than a sensor node transmitting and receiving 96-bits of data. Moreover, in practice, an RFID reader has to read multiple tags in its interrogation zone, all of which may reply simultaneously. As a result, the RFID reader experiences collisions and unnecessary energy wastage that ultimately shortens a WSN's lifetime. For these reasons, it is imperative that a comprehensive study on the energy efficiency of existing RFID tag reading or anti-collision protocols be conducted in order to determine their suitability for use in RFID-enhanced WSNs.This thesis, therefore, investigates the energy efficiency of Aloha based RFID anti-collision protocols. These protocols have low memory and bandwidth requirements, adaptive to changing tag population, and a small number of reader to tag commands; thereby, making them easy to implement on sensor nodes.  Using analytical and simulation studies, this thesis shows that collisions and idle listening to be the key causes of energy consumption. Idle listening consumes a significant amount of energy, especially when the number of tags is low, but as the number of tags increases, collisions become the main cause of energy expenditure.Another major finding is that existing anti-collision protocols are unable to monitor tags in an energy efficient manner. Specifically, in order to monitor tags, these protocols must undergo the collision resolution process repeatedly. This problem is particularly acute when tag population changes frequently. Hence, there is a clear need for energy efficient protocols that can determine new and old tags quickly. To this end, this thesis is the first to propose ResMon, an anticollision protocol that is designed to be energy efficient during identification and monitoring. Extensive simulation studies show ResMon's energy consumption to be significantly lower than state of the art framed Aloha variants; thus, making it ideal for use in RFID-enhanced WSNs.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Content-based retrieval from image databases using sketched queries</field><field name="creator">Chalechale, Abdolah</field><field name="description">Searching multimedia databases using features extracted from the content is currently an active research area. This thesis presents novel feature extraction approaches for content-based image retrieval when the query image is a hand-drawn black and white sketch. To facilitate robust man-machine interfaces, we accept query images with no color and texture attributes. Special attention is given to the scale and rotation invariance properties since the query and database images may vary in size and rotation angle. Several applicable techniques within the literature are studied for these conditions. The goal is to present the user with a subset of images that are more similar to the sketched query. New affine transform invariant feature extraction techniques are proposed to improve retrieval performance, and reduce the extraction and search times. The techniques are tested both generally for multi-component images and particularly for isolated shapes. The solutions are discussed for each specific application. Finally, signature-based document retrieval, which explores document retrieval from databases using human signatures, is investigated on an individual basis. Two different approaches based on spatial distribution of edge pixels are proposed for general sketch-based image retrieval. Here, the database images consist of multiple complex objects within an inhomogeneous background. One of the methods is an improved version of another, which increases retrieval performance. Both techniques exhibit scale invariance property resulting from size normalization. Rotation invariance property is achieved by employing the magnitude of the Fourier transform coefficients in two different ways. A database including 4000 artwork and photograph images is used for the experiments. One of the most important aspects of the proposed methods is that the image segmentation is not needed. This significantly improves the feature extraction process and enables the methods to be used for other computer vision applications. Edge image matching is studied as an example. Sketch-based shape retrieval, which deals with images containing an isolated shape, is studied next. This is to emphasize on the existing differences between general images and isolated shapes for sketch-based retrieval. A new approach is proposed for this task, which outperforms alternative approaches. In this approach a chain code differentiation of contour shapes is applied for contour poligonization. The geometric properties of the resulting polygon are used to extract hybrid and efficient features. A signature region extraction method is proposed as a preprocessing stage in signature based document retrieval. Several feature extraction techniques are adapted and examined for this application and the results are discussed. In all the experiments, the Average Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank (ANMRR), which was developed in the MPEG-7 standardization process, is used as the retrieval performance criterion. Feature extraction and search times are computed for time based comparisons. The proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in retrieval accuracy. There is also marked improvement in feature extraction and search speed for the proposed methods.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing simulations to improve learner outcomes in ecological education</field><field name="creator">Corderoy, Robert M</field><field name="description">The study of complex ecological processes presents many difficulties for learners including the time frame in which it may take place and the complexity of the relationships involved. The learning outcomes and level of understanding of the underlying relationships for students studying such processes may be effectively supported and improved through the use of carefully designed simulations which provide the learner with the opportunity to explore and test their ideas, knowledge and understanding without risk. The purpose of this study was to design, develop, implement and test the efficacy of a simulation tool designed to simulate algal bloom in a river catchment environment in terms of its potential to produce improved learning outcomes and understanding of relationships for the learners. There has always been a suspicion amongst some educators, particularly those who have limited computer literacy, that the platforms of the information technology revolution are simply new toys in the hands of resource developers and researchers, and that the outcome is simply an application of such technologies in the misguided belief that such delivery systems for educational experiences provide some sort of advantage over the more traditional methods. This study is based on two assertions with regard to the educational effectiveness of simulations in educational environments. First, that to be effective simulations need to have been designed in accordance with contemporary theoretical principles in terms of both pedagogical and user interaction issues with regard to modelling the real world effectively so as to provide an authentic environment in which the user may construct knowledge and understanding of complex processes. Second, that students using such simulations will have better learning outcomes and develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between the variables involved than those who are exposed to a more conventional approach in terms the representational media adopted, available resources and teaching methods.In summary, the study was designed to test the efficacy of the assertion that with careful design, interactive simulations which mimic complex ecological processes can provide the opportunity for improved learning outcomes and the development of a deeper understanding of the underlying relationships. The experimental materials used in this study comprised the software package Exploring the Nardoo and the algal bloom simulation tool embedded within it. The package is an interactive multimedia CD-ROM based learning environment designed with a constructivist approach. It attempts to provide a realistic, risk free information rich learning space in which students may explore, test their understanding of specific issues, and develop solutions to authentic tasks. The methodological approach adopted for this study was of a classic experimental design pre/post test and based in the Scientific Paradigm. Such a pure experimental approach was essential to testing the stated hypotheses, however in order to provide a more complete picture of the nature of user/software interactions, a hybrid quantitative/qualitative approach was used. The data set on which the analysis of the study was based was collected using researcher designed instruments; a Knowledge Acquisition Schedule KAS, a Cause and Effect Schedule CES and a User Perceived Value Schedule UPS. Subjective information in the form of field observation records and comments was also collected. Such an approach provided a context in which the research question could be tested and considered while maintaining the necessary research rigour. The operational population, third year pre-service student teachers, was chosen from the target population by the use of the technique of cluster sampling. The data collected from the Knowledge Acquisition Schedule KAS indicated that use of the package Exploring the Nardoo resulted in significantly improved acquisition of factual knowledge for both the control and experimental groups. This was not unexpected as the overall design of the software was such that all students had access to extensive multi-format information on all aspects of algal blooms and the investigation was designed so as to be independent of the algal bloom simulation tool. The fact that the experimental groups KAS mean scores showed a significantly greater increase than those of the control group would suggest that using the simulation tool also supported factual knowledge acquisition. Analysis of the Cause and Effect Schedule CES data suggests that the simulation tool also facilitated a deeper understanding of the processes and the relationships between causal factors for the students who had access to the simulation tool. Examination of the pre and post CES mean scores data indicated that the students using the simulation tool not only improved their CES mean scores, but improved them by a significantly greater margin than those in the control group. This outcome adds support to the assertion that, when students have the opportunity to test and re-assess their mental models of complex systems, the processes and relationships at work, in meaningful learning environments and supported by appropriate tools, there is the potential for improved learning outcomes and the development of deeper understanding. The data collected from the UPS added support to these findings and issues relating to the design and function of the simulation tool. In summary, the overall findings suggest that, simulations which are designed in terms of contemporary theoretical principles with regard to functionality and pedagogical strategies, and are embedded within rich, multimedia based learning environments have the potential to provide the user with a greatly enriched experience by facilitating the review of existing learner knowledge and the construction of new learner knowledge.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of employee participation in the private sector: Malaysian case studies</field><field name="creator">Parasuraman, Balakrishnan</field><field name="description">Employee participation refers to a wide variety of policies, mechanisms, and practices that enable employees to take part in decision-making, frequently at the level of the enterprise or workplace. The subject of employee participation (EP) in the organisation has attracted a great deal of international interest as attested by the considerable amount of research in the issue. However, whereas the issues have been fairly well researched in OECD countries, especially those in Europe, EP has been rather less emphasised in Asia. The few studies that have been conducted on EP in this Malaysia have been from the organisational behaviour perspective with a narrow set of variables under consideration. The present study makes significant contributions across all areas of EP for scholarly researchers as well as practitioners and policy-makers in Malaysia. The primary objective of this study has been to provide an insight in to why private companies (Steelco, Autoco and Posco) in Malaysia have developed direct and indirect forms, and what have been the major determinants and influences on the choice of forms of EP. The next objective of the study is to understand whether or not unions and non-managerial employees have any capacity to influence management final decision-making process at the firm level. To achieve these research objectives, a qualitative case research strategy was selected, which was appropriate given the paucity of information on EP in the Malaysian private sector. An extensive empirical research was undertaken through interviews with national union leaders, employers, managers, union representatives, and non-managerial employees. In addition to the interview technique, direct participation, memos, and reflective journal data were also utilised in this study. The results of the interview, direct observation, memos and reflective journal were triangulated for validity of study. These methods were also discussed in terms of their academic contributions to understanding why EP was implemented at company and workplace level, and concomitantly to study the capacity of the unions and non-managerial employees to influence management final decisions.The findings form the case study research of Steelco, Autoco and Posco found new factors, only rarely discussed in the international EP literature, to be important. These included mergers and acquisitions, privatisation policy, Malaysia&#8217;s Look East Policy, cross-cultural management styles and the influence of British colonial system. Other major research findings are related to the second objective of this study. The research results from studying Steelco, Autoco and Posco demonstrated that unions and nonmanagerial employees have very limited capacity to influence the management final decisions at company level. This is due to the Industrial Relations Act (managerial prerogative clause) 1967, the management attitudes towards union and workers, cultural orientation and values among Malaysia employees, and ineffectiveness of the Code of Conduct for Industrial Harmony 1975. The findings of present research have some implication for analytical models of EP, particularly the Favourable Conjunctures Model. As a consequence, a new model of EP which incorporates these findings from the Malaysian private sector is proposed in this research. The study concludes that this research not only contributes to the academic literature on EP but it should be of value of practitioners in industrial relations and human resource management, unions, the government agencies (Ministry of Human Resources Malaysia). In future research, similar studies can be applied more widely in Malaysia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appropriating culture to recuperate history/prisoner</field><field name="creator">Keeley, Terence J</field><field name="description">The following thesis consists of three parts: a research paper comparing two other texts, In Country by Bobbie Ann Mason and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera, that incorporate the same or similar strategies as those adopted in the creative component of the thesis, a synopsis of two related texts preceding the creative component, and finally, the creative component itself, Prisoner.  	The essay, requiring research into critiques of the Mason and Kundera texts, found a number of parallels between them and my own creative practices relating to Prisoner. All three texts can be seen to appropriate icons of popular culture, and high culture on the part of Kundera, as part of their strategy to tell a story. Additionally, all three can be seen to develop similar, and occasionally oppositional, philosophical discourse on the recuperation of history, at both a personal and political level.	The inclusion of a synopsis of two creative texts written prior to Prisoner, was deemed necessary as they set the stage for the third and final text in completing an extended narrative. 	The creative text itself completes the story begun in the previous texts, The Visitation and The Interview, and resolves the ambiguities inherent in the previous texts. Additionally, it incorporates a strategy, much like Mason and Kundera, of appropriating a popular cultural icon in Prisoner &#8211; the television series of the early eighties, as part of its discourse into the recycling and re-interpretation of history conducted by the story&#8217;s characters.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/23</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Government-initiated community website schemes: what can we learn from the implementation of an Australian model?</field><field name="creator">Norris, Alison E</field><field name="description">As the Internet has become integral to our daily lives, many community websites have been developed in an attempt to create &#8216;community&#8217; online and to support traditional communities. These community websites were typically developed on an ad-hoc basis. In 2002, the Australian Domain Name Administrators responded to the lack of government-initiated, structured community website schemes by establishing the Community Geographic Domain Name (CGDN) Scheme. This Scheme created new domain names, solely for the use of community groups with the purpose of building community websites. Before gaining access to a CGDN, a community group must demonstrate their links to the community and meet numerous conditions. To date, there has been limited research into the issues that affect government-initiated, structured community website schemes, and no studies have compared the experiences of multiple community websites developed under such schemes to identify factors that affect the viability of these websites and the schemes as a whole. This thesis aims to develop a deeper understanding of the issues associated with government-initiated, structured community website schemes, using an instance of such schemes: the CGDN Scheme. Using a case study approach, an analysis of the CGDN Scheme, and its viability, is completed. Through case studies of the three communities participating in the trial of the CGDN Scheme (Wollongong, New South Wales; Bathurst, New South Wales; and Ballarat, Victoria), rich qualitative data is collected from a variety of data sources about the experiences of the case study participants. Qualitative data is also collected from and about the CGDN management bodies and the CGDN Policy. Based on this data, issues faced by these case studies and by the CGDN Scheme management bodies are identified and their implications discussed. To consolidate the findings of the case studies in a format that is easy for communities to manage and apply, the relationships between these issues are modelled, and the issues are grouped into eight categories: auDA and auCD, Policy, CGDN Project leadership, Publicity and advertising, Community involvement, Finance, Community Website Group and Infrastructure. These issues and factors are mapped using four models. A comparison of approaches chosen by the three test cases allows the implications of such decisions to be considered, and recommendations to improve the viability of the CGDN - iii - Scheme are provided. Finally, recommendations for the establishment of governmentinitiated, structured community website schemes are presented. These recommendations provide a summary of the contribution that this thesis makes to a deeper understanding of government-initiated, structured community website schemes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/32</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the level of consumer involvement in healthcare</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Karen</field><field name="description">Health and consumerism is a partnership featured in many Western developed countries. Nearly a decade ago, the National Quality Taskforce and Advisory Council recommended the adoption of a consumer oriented approach as being fundamental to providing safer services, minimising preventable adverse health outcomes, whist also improving healthcare quality. In accordance with this recommendation, it is now commonplace for healthcare organisations to incorporate the consumer oriented philosophy into their mission statements. In addition, healthcare recipients tend to be referred to as consumers in preference to the traditional term patient. Despite organisational commitment for change and reports of consumer satisfaction with acute care services in Australia (AIHW 2000), the findings from the Bristol Inquiry (2001) and the King Edward Memorial Hospital Inquiry (2001) suggests that there is an absence of consensus as to the impact of these initiatives on the delivery or quality of frontline healthcare. This study aims to determine indicators of consumer participation in the planning and delivery of healthcare in an Australian context. The practice of consumer participation at the individual level of frontline healthcare is examined specifically for indicators of active participation in both decision making and information sharing. This study is complimentary to Phase Two of a Commonwealth funded project designed to explore clinical teams and the organisation of care related to the clinical condition, elective caesarean section. The study&#8217;s participants have been determined by the Commonwealth project, with the study&#8217;s samples being drawn from the recipients and providers of elective caesarean section healthcare, in three Queensland public hospitals over a three month time frame.A multi-method approach is utilised to navigate the complex social and professional constructs that impact on the organisation and recording of elective caesarean section healthcare.  Triangulation of the environmental, clinician, consumer and medical record data from the three study sites allows for a greater understanding of the relationships between and within the data sets. The medical record audits tendency to lack evidence of consumers actively participating in information sharing and decision making is shown to be a reliable representation of the environments inability to support participation, and the clinician and consumer samples passive view of participation at the frontline of healthcare. The triangulated data also clearly demonstrates the diversity of views and behaviours that clinicians hold in relation to the involvement of consumers in healthcare and that in the main consumer involvement is not valued. In relation to the quality and safety of healthcare, aside from the clinician&#8217;s views on consumer participation, the absence of accountability to utilise standardised forms, function collaboratively or communicate clinical care effectively suggests that the study sites have numerous professional and governance issues that have yet to be effectively addressed.  In focusing on the individual aspects of the healthcare experience this study demonstrates that collection and aggregation of consumer satisfaction data to be an unreliable indictor of healthcare quality. This study demonstrates a potential relationship between expectations of healthcare and satisfaction with healthcare. Women who felt fully involved in decision making often claim to be dissatisfied with that level of involvement and women who felt uninvolved are often satisfied with not being involved. In order to satisfy consumers and secure a positive health outcome measure, the study findings suggest matching expectations with experience, and this would involve an active level of participation. However, meeting the consumer&#8217;s expectations and generating satisfaction should not be interpreted as representative of meeting the technical quality or service delivery standards.This study contributes to the limited body of research relating to consumer participation at the individual level of healthcare. The study demonstrates that overall the level of consumer involvement in healthcare is marginal. Inconsistency in beliefs and behaviours and an ad hoc approach to organising and communicating clinical care ensures the passivity of the healthcare recipients and brings into question the true quality and safety of Australian healthcare.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grinding polycrystalline diamond using a diamond grinding wheel</field><field name="creator">Agahi, Maryam</field><field name="description">Application of ultrahard cutting tool materials is continuously expanding. One example of an ultrahard cutting tool material is polycrystalline diamond (PCD), which is widely used in tool making and machining. However, because of the high wear resistance of PCD it is characterised by low grindability and machinability. So, any mechanism used to machine PCD has to meet specific requirements. Grinding with a diamond grinding wheel is one of the economic ways to machine PCD compacts. This thesis considers the grinding of polycrystalline diamond using a conventional grinding machine and makes machining parameter recommendations to support the optimisation of PCD grinding. The PCD grinding forces are mathematically analysed. These grinding forces are measured using a force sensor installed on a conventional grinding machine. The forces produced during grinding are investigated as a function of in-feed, contact zone, material removal rate (MRR) and oscillation rate. Wheel conditioning, another major aspect of PCD grinding, is studied and optimised in order to reduce the grinding forces, increase the cutting efficiency and achieve maximum removal rates and minimum wear ratios. Grinding wheel wear is investigated as a recognized problem in PCD grinding. A series of experiments are conducted in which the material removal rate, the rate of wheel wear and the grinding forces are measured. The effects of in-feed, sharpening process and work piece hardness on the wheel wear are studied. The edge quality of the PCD compacts is investigated as an important issue in tool making. Factors affecting PCD grinding quality include the in-feed, material removal rate, the condition of the diamond grinding wheel and the rigidity of the grinding machine. These are all studied to find their effect on edge quality. The work presented in this thesis also shows that the capability of a conventional grinding machine designed for non-PCD is sufficient to grind PCD with acceptable quality.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of potential dual-action antibacterial agents</field><field name="creator">Ambrus, Joseph Imre</field><field name="description">With the ever-present threat of bacteria becoming resistant to all known antibacterial drugs comes a pressing need to develop new antibacterial agents which circumvent this resistance. One of the major mechanisms of resistance that bacteria employ to compromise the activity of antibacterials is through efflux pumps. These pumps, such as the NorA pump in Staphylococcus aureus, have the ability to extrude a wide range of structurally dissimilar antibiotics, hence conferring multidrug resistance to the bacteria. To date, there have been no therapeutically useful inhibitors of efflux pumps developed and thus there is great scope to develop agents which address this clinically relevant problem.This dissertation focused on two main strands of research. The first addressed the need for new inhibitors of bacterial efflux pumps. A structure-activity based approach to drug design was utilised, centering on the lead NorA inhibitor 2-phenyl-5-nitro-1H-indole. These synthetic efforts led to the discovery of 2-phenyl-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile (70) as a potential new inhibitor of the NorA pump, with an MIC of 3.6 mM (in the presence of the antibacterial berberine at 100 mg/mL; 269.0 mM) against the NorA wild-type strain of S. aureus. A serendipitous discovery of a novel antibacterial agent, the alcohol (2-phenyl-1H-indol-5-yl)-methanol (75), was made during these studies. This alcohol was found to have a direct antibacterial MIC of 13.4 mM against a NorA pump knockout strain of S. aureus and 28.0 mM against the NorA wild-type and overexpressing strains of S. aureus. This new compound offers a simple, heterocyclic lead compound for future development as an antibacterial agent. The inter-related second strand of research took advantage of dual action-based approaches to drug design. Several dual action drugs were synthesised which combined an efflux pump-sensitive antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) and efflux pump inhibitor analogue. Of these compounds, 90, 91 and 96 showed promising antibacterial activities with MIC&#8217;s of 0.6, 3.9 and 1.5 mM respectively against all three strains of S. aureus (NorA knockout, NorA wild-type and NorA overexpressing). This data confirmed that these dual action drugs were evading this particular resistance mechanism and helped to validate this principle of dual action drug design.A novel dual action prodrug was also designed and a protected version synthesised. This prodrug contained the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) linked to an efflux pump inhibitor analogue through a &#946;-lactam nucleus, which was planned to act as a bacterially-specific triggering mechanism. Future work will involve the complete synthesis and testing of this prodrug 122 to assess its antibacterial activity and to determine if it is acting as a dual action prodrug.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of novel extracellular molecular chaperones and their effects on amyloid formation</field><field name="creator">Yerbury, Justin J</field><field name="description">Individual proteins have a specific three-dimensional structure that gives them their unique function. However, a protein must be folded from a linear string of amino acids in order to gain this native conformation and thus function. There are many hurdles to a protein attaining and maintaining its native conformation. Stresses that are encountered in the life of a protein, such as changes in pH, temperature and oxidative stress, can promote protein misfolding or unfolding. In addition, some genetic mutations can modify a protein such that a non-native conformation is more energetically favourable than the native state. The unfolding or misfolding of a protein makes it more likely that it will aggregate with itself. There are more than 40 human diseases associated with the inappropriate deposition of aggregated protein. It is well known that there is a welldefined and efficient quality control system to deal with intracellular proteins that have either unfolded or are misfolded. Cells have a range of molecular chaperones to inhibit inappropriate aggregation and if this fails the cell labels the proteins with ubiquitin for degradation via the proteasome. However, many proteins are secreted from cells into the extracellular environment and there are many protein deposition disorders associated with extracellular protein deposits, outside the reach of the well-characterised intracellular quality control system. This thesis reports that the secreted proteins haptoglobin and a2-macroglobulin have small heat shock protein-like chaperone activity. Both haptoglobin and a2- macroglobulin specifically inhibited the precipitation of a variety of proteins induced by either heat or oxidation, including proteins in unfractionated human serum. In addition, it was demonstrated that haptoglobin and a2-macroglobulin inhibit the precipitation of stressed proteins by forming solubilized complexes with them, cannot protect enzymes from heat-induced loss of function, and lack ATPase activity and the ability to independently refold proteins following stresses. In addition, data presented here shows that clusterin, haptoglobin and a2-macroglobulin exert potent effects on amyloid formation, and provide evidence to suggest that these effects are exerted via interactions with pre-fibrillar species. These findings suggest that clusterin, haptoglobin and a2- macroglobulin are an important element in the control of extracellular protein misfolding.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/79</field></doc><doc><field name="title">National policy choices for an international problem: case studies in greenhouse policy</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the choices governments make for their policy instruments in the context of a single national problem &#8211; climate change. Taking into account the context in which such decisions are made, the thesis seeks to identify the broader motivations influencing governments in their policy development and implementation. It considers also the implicit constraints on instrument choice and application arising from that context. A knowledge of such motivations and constraints is important for what it implies about the prospects for structured international cooperation requiring specific domestic actions, as is the case in climate change. Various theoretical frameworks exist which seek to explain why governments may act in a particular manner. No one of these could be said to dominate others, or to be uniquely applicable in any given situation. This thesis seeks to contribute to the understanding of government motivations by analysing the actions taken by five national governments &#8211; Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia - in pursuit of a common objective, over the period 1990 &#8211; 2004. The policy goal considered is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for the purpose of mitigating global climate change. Using a case study approach, it examines the national and international context in which the various governments developed and implemented their national actions in pursuit of that policy goal. Further, it analyses the policy instruments governments adopted for the purpose, developing a numerical assessment of the reliance placed on instruments of different type, and the results achieved in their application. Taking account of the various explanatory frameworks, both the policy-making context and the observed policy actions are used to analyse the principal influences and motivations which have led to the outcome observed in each case. In addition to inferences of likely government motivations, the individual national case studies provide both an examination of real policy instruments in use, and measures of the reliance placed on different instrument types, and their effectiveness. In three of the cases, the dominant motivation inferred for government actions was that of the pursuit of the public interest, albeit markedly differing from textbook definitions of the &#8220;public interest&#8221;. In the remaining two studies, institutional constraints were seen to be the major determinants of outcomes, with those institutional constraints underpinned in the one case by public interest considerations, and in the other by public choice influences. The cases also demonstrated the higher degree of policy effectiveness associated with the more coercive instruments such as regulation.The cross-border commonality of the policy issue studied here made possible the examination of results from individual cases from a cross-case perspective. Further aspects were evident from that, notably the influence of international relationships on domestic policy-making, and the limited role played by environmental advocacy groups in influencing policy implementation. The case studies showed that the only country where environmental pressure group representation could be seen as significant was in Germany, where representation took place through formal political participation, and the leverage so gained. The principal objective of this thesis has been to throw light on the motivations of and influences on government in policy-making and implementation. In addition however, the research approach adopted has provided insights into the very real issues faced by national governments seeking to counter a problem of the nature of greenhouse gas emission reduction. These issues, and the means by which different governments have sought to address them, are central determinants of the likely success or failure of attempts at coordinated international action in one of the most critical current challenges, that of global climate change.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of urbanisation on floods</field><field name="creator">Bufill, Monica Corina</field><field name="description">The transition of a catchment from an initially natural or rural condition to an urban environment involves dramatic changes to water and soil resources on a time scale which is an order of magnitude different to most natural processes. As MacPherson (1975) pointed out, natural changes generally occur in a timescale of eons while man can modify the environment in a number of ways in a matter of years.Changes to the hydrological regime due to urbanisation processes have been comprehensively described by Savini and Kammerer (1961). They analyse the hydrological effects of changes in land and water use associated with the different stages of urban development. Most of the described modifications to the natural or rural environment have some degree of impact on the flood hydrograph, but the alteration of catchment surfaces and the modification of the natural drainage system have by far the most important consequences.Catchment surfaces are modified initially by the removal of vegetation and the disturbance of the topsoil. This modifies the patterns of interception, evaporation and transpiration and the infiltration capacity is generally reduced because the compacting of the top layers of soil blocks or destroys interflow paths. Further changes are introduced when originally pervious surfaces are built up and made impervious. Infiltration is reduced, and rainfall that would originally have replenished the groundwater storage, becomes surface runoff. The texture of surfaces is also modified. Smoother and more uniform surfaces replace rougher natural surfaces. As a consequence of this, the velocity of surface runoff is increased.The stream network in a natural catchment is the result of the dynamic equilibrium between climatic conditions and the characteristics of the surfaces drained by the network. This network varies seasonally in its extension. The modification of catchment surfaces implies that a different drainage network must be created in order to accommodate the new conditions in which runoff is generated. Modifications to the drainage network can take different forms, according to the stage of urban development. In the initial stages, when the extent of the modified surfaces is still small, the natural streams can be cleared of vegetation, their layout can be rectified and their cross sections made regular and enlarged, to achieve a higher conveyance. In later stages the streams will be lined and finally the drainage system will be partially or totally replaced by a network of underground pipes. This can be clearly seen if suburban areas in different stages of development are compared, and if they are in turn compared with central city areas. In the outer suburbs the main streams can be left in a nearly natural condition and the adjacent floodplains are free of buildings. In the areas closer to the city the cost of the land will dictate a more intensive utilisation, and so the surface area assigned to the drainage system will be reduced. In these areas the floodplain will be built up and the drainage system will consist of a pipe network. Urban dwellers will tend to forget the former existence of streams except when a rare rainfall event produces flooding.As mentioned above, the factors that generate increased flooding in urban areas are mainly the sealing of formerly pervious surfaces and the modifications introduced to the drainage system. The proportion with which each factor contributes to the increase in flooding is not easy to measure, as the construction of buildings and the changes in the drainage system are generally introduced simultaneously. Packman (1979) suggests that the sealing of surfaces and therefore the reduction in the time of travel of flow on these surfaces will have a larger impact in the case of small catchments, because surface flow is the process that has longer times as compared to channel flow. The reverse would be true for larger catchments, where channel improvements will account reductions in the times of travel.In this study, the hydrological processes that are relevant to the generation of floods in urban areas have been identified and analysed. The underlying criterion has been to extract as much information as possible on these processes from the analysis of recorded rainfall and streamflow records. Working hypotheses were introduced only on the basis of observation from these data when this first source of information was exhausted. This approach was preferred to the alternative one of proposing a theoretical model and testing it against available data. The volume of good quality rainfall and streamflow data currently available for Australian catchments seemed to warrant that an approach without preconceptions to the analysis of these data could lead to the understanding of the relevant processes involved in the formation of floods.Cordery and Pilgrim (1979), after reviewing design methods for small hydraulic structures, commonly used in Australian agencies, pointed out the need to develop predictive tools for Australian conditions. They noted that these design procedures have been developed for different environments and have not been validated in Australia. Because the conclusions in this study rely heavily on the analysis of data, it is hoped that they will contribute towards the assessment of flooding in Australian urban catchments.Data from ten Australian and six overseas urban catchments were collected from stream gauging agencies, and the rainfall-runoff process in each of them was studied and characterised. The joint analysis of the catchments showed that although they have different geographical and climatological features, there are similarities in their behaviour. Those aspects of the rainfall-runoff process that were found to be common to all catchments were formulated mathematically in a model, and methods to estimate the model's parameters from catchment characteristics were proposed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentiating thermal from non-thermal eccrine sweating during exercise and heat stress</field><field name="creator">Hosie, Andrew</field><field name="description">This project investigated the non-thermal factors which influence the control of eccrine sweating during exercise, with particular emphasis upon mechanoreceptor feedback and feedforward regulation. The aim of this project was to attempt to differentiate between these two neural pathways using three experimental treatments (active exercise; passive exercise and passive heating), with core temperature clamped among treatments and two pedal frequencies used for both the active and passive exercise conditions. It was hypothesised that during active (dynamic) exercise, sweat rates (m_(subscript SW)) and sweat expulsion frequencies (f(subscript SW)) would exceed those of the passive exercise and passive heating trials. It was expected that, when the pedal force was doubled during the active exercise trials, both the m_(subscript SW) and f(subscript SW) would exceed those values observed at the lower pedal force. Ten male subjects participated in five experimental trials: (a) two active (dynamic) exercise trials, in which the subjects voluntarily cycled at two different pedal frequencies; (b) two passive exercise trials, in which subjects were driven at the same two pedal frequencies, but did not actively recruite muscles to either track or resist the pedal motion; and (c) a seated resting trial, with subjects passively heated to track core temperature (T(subscript C)) changes in the other conditions. The combination of a water-perfusion garment and a climate chamber was used to increase and clamp T(subscript C) at similar rates across the five trials. During these trials, the following variables were measured: core temperatures at the oesophagus (T(subscript es)), auditory canal (T(subscript ac)), and the rectum (T(subscript re)); skin temperatures at eight sites; m_(subscript sw) were measured simultaneously at six locations; f(subscript sw) were identified using sweat data from the forehead and forearm sites; cardiac frequency (f(subscript c) ; ventricular depolarisation); thermal sensation; and ratings of perceived exertion. Of particular interest for this project were the variables of m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) , and how they were affected by differences in pedal frequency (active versus passive exercise) and passive heating. The primary observation for these trials was that, when comparing the active and passive trials at the same pedal frequency, m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) were very similar for each of the pedal frequencies, in the period from 15 to 25 minutes. However, the initial comparisons between m_(subscript sw)and f(subscript sw)of the active and passive trials were significantly different. When comparing trials at different pedal frequencies, but within the active exercise mode, a consistent trend in the m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) was observed, with both being at 80 rev.min-1, relative to 40 rev.min-1 trials, though this was not statistically significant. For the same comparison in the passive exercise mode, the principal difference was the thermal load which was imposed on the subjects, with the data from the seated resting trials being greater than both the passive and active exercise trials. These observations may be interpreted in the following manner. First, the role of joint and muscle mechanoreceptors feedback may have been an influencing factor in the similarities of m_(subscript sw) and f(subscript sw) in the period from 15-25 minutes. Second, in the active exercise trials, the initiation of sweating seemed to be more related to central feedforward command, a non-thermal influence, while the passive and seated resting trials, were related more to feedback control, created from the differences in thermal gradient of T(subscript c) and T(subscript sk). Third, it would seem that thermal and non-thermal influences both play a role in the control of sweating, but their relative contribution may be modified by internal temperature and skin temperature changes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data-driven motion correction in single photon emission computed tomography of the brain</field><field name="creator">Kyme, Andre Z</field><field name="description">Introduction: Patient head motion is a well-recognised problem in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain. Motion occurring between or during the acquisition of projections can lead to reconstruction artifacts that compromise accurate patient diagnosis. Although some form of restraint tends to be used in practice, motion incidence and magnitude is still high enough to warrant frequent repeat studies or the application of motion correction. The motivation for this work was the outstanding need for a high-performance motion correction strategy for brain studies. Such a strategy should accurately correct general rigid-body motion. The optimal strategy would also be non-invasive, have a high degree of automation, and be fast, convenient (requiring little or no calibration, patient cooperation, and extra gadgetry), and robust with respect to noise. We describe and implement a fully 3D, non-invasive, data-driven approach that is suitable for use with clinical data and is potentially automatic. The approach is based on a comparison of measured and estimated projection data. Acquired projections are segregated into groups corresponding to discrete locations held by the brain during scanning and the largest group is reconstructed. The position and orientation of this reconstruction is optimised for each remaining group by comparing the measured projections with those generated from the transformed reconstruction. After each optimisation, the current reconstruction estimate is updated with the relevant projections using the ordered-subsets expectation maximisation (OSEM) algorithm. Methods: Three sets of experiments were carried out on different types of data to validate the motion correction procedure and investigate practical aspects of implementing the approach clinically. In the initial set of experiments, seven noisy motion-corrupted projection sets simulating 2-4 head positions were generated from the digital Hoffman brain phantom. The angular location and extent of movement and the magnitude of rotation and translation with respect to each axis was varied for each set. Motion correction was applied to these data using various regimes: with/without attenuation included in the optimisation; with/without a second iteration. Extracted motion parameters were compared with the applied movements. The error between the extracted and applied parameters was quantified in terms of the mean registration error (MRE), an average displacement of the vertices of a box surrounding the brain. Overall improvement from motion correction was quantified in terms of a mean squared difference improvement ratio (MSDR). Corrected, uncorrected, and motion-free slices were also compared visually. For the second group of experiments, three physical Hoffman phantom studies containing single or double movements were obtained. The Polaris motion tracker was used to provide an independent measurement of motion. Motion parameters were extracted using our approach and compared with those measured by the Polaris. An investigation of cost function behaviour was also carried out by mapping the cost function in the neighbourhood of the Polaris solution. The third group of experiments constituted a preliminary clinical validation. Three volunteers underwent a motion-free scan followed by a scan in which they performed one head movement. A fourth volunteer underwent two scans, holding a single (but different) brain location in each. Again the Polaris was used to measure the motion independent of our technique. Data from the fourth volunteer was used to simulate two single-movement studies, facilitating a rigorous quantification of the improvement obtained from motion correction. Optimisations were performed with and without reduced projections, scatter correction, thresholding of background counts, compensation to avoid biasing from truncated data, and pre-smoothing of the acquired data. Results: In the digital phantom experiments, estimated rotations and translations were mostly within 2(degrees) and 1mm of the applied values. The MRE was less than 1 pixel in most cases. Accurate motion estimates could be obtained at over twice the speed by leaving attenuation out of the optimisation stage. Visually, there was a clear reduction in motion-induced artifacts after correction. Most MSDR values were well in excess of 2, and the MSDR tended to increase with increasing corruption. A second iteration of correction did not provide sufficient improvement to warrant the additional time cost. In the physical phantom experiments there was good agreement between the extracted and Polaris measurements for the x and y-rotation and z-translation parameters. A systematic discrepancy existed for the remaining parameters. The discrepancy was reduced for the third dataset (two movements); in this case the corrected study closely resembled that obtained using the Polaris values. Analysis of the cost function indicated that the MSD was fairly insensitive to large rotations whilst being sensitive to typical translations. Discrepancies appeared to be the result of object symmetry. In all of the volunteer studies, sets of motion parameters were obtained that closely followed the trend of the Polaris. In general, however, there was a systematic discrepancy from the actual Polaris values. Scatter correction had little effect on accuracy. Using reduced projections (greater proportion of the image occupied by brain) tended to provide estimates as good or better than using larger projections. Pre-smoothing generally lead to less accurate estimates. For large movements, tracking the plane of truncation was necessary to obtain sensible estimates. Thresholding was important in removing background counts and confining the solution to a sensible portion of the cost function. For all volunteers there was a clear improvement in image symmetry and contrast after using our approach. In certain cases, correction was better than that obtained from the Polaris. Of particular concern is the method used for attaching the head target. Poor attachment can lead to decoupling of target and head movement. For the two semi-simulated studies, the MSD improved by approximately 4 and 2 respectively, whereas the Polaris provided no improvement. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that complex brain movements in simulated and real data can be accurately estimated and corrected using this data-driven approach.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/185</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of Chrysanthemoides monilifera spp. rotundata (bitou bush) on coastal ecosystem processes</field><field name="creator">Lindsay, Elizabeth A</field><field name="description">On the southeast coast of Australia, there are extensive infestations of the environmental weed Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata (L.) T. Norl. (Bitou bush). This weed is highly invasive and persistent, yet little is known about how it impacts on coastal ecosystems. Plant invasions can greatly alter the area they invade, and can modify primary productivity, plant species composition, species diversity, decrease ecosystem stability and disrupt ecosystem processes. This research aimed to determine if C. monilifera invasion changes leaf litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Leaf litter invertebrates were also investigated as they play key roles in functioning of forest ecosystems and can greatly enhance litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. The herbicide glyphosate is widely used to control C. monilifera, however there have been few studies examining the effects of this herbicide on invertebrate communities in the field, especially on sand dunes. I aimed to determine if glyphosate application impacts leaf litter invertebrate involved in decomposition. Field studies and experiments were undertaken in five sites along the NSW coastline, each with an area heavily infested with C. monilifera and in native un-infested area. A litterbag decomposition study found that the succulent C. monilifera leaves decomposed at least three times faster than a sclerophyllous native leaf mix (Acacia longifolia var. longifolia, Banksia integrifolia and Leptospermum laevigatum) with the decomposition rates being related to the physical properties of the leaves. Nutrients were leached and mineralised quicker from the C. monilifera leaves, mostly due to the rapid decay. There was some immobilisation of sulphur and phosphorous in the native leaves when placed in the native sites and more immobilisation is expected with time. C. monoilifera leaves decayed significantly faster in coarse mesh litterbags compared to the fine mesh, indicating leaf littler invertebrates positively influenced their decomposition. Mesh size had little effect on the native leaf decomposition rate. All C. monilifera litterbags and the coarse native litterbags decomposed faster and generally had greater nutrient loss within the C. monilifera infestations. This is due to an increase in invertebrate detritivores within the C. monilifera, and dense infestations creating a protected environment with an altered microclimate. There was a greater input of litter to the native sites, and this was highly seasonal compared to the C. monilifera areas. Maximal litter fall corresponded with period of peak flowering and growth (spring-summer). Due to the higher leaf fall rate there is a greater input of nutrients to the forest floor in the native sites, even though large amounts of nutrients were withdrawn from the leaves before abscission. The slow decomposition and high litter fall resulted in greater amounts of litter accumulating on the native forest floor, which appears to act as a nutrient sink. Invasion by C. monilifera in coastal areas does not appear to change the nitrogen budget, but there are differences in where nitrogen is stored in comparison to uninvaded areas. The total soil nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were significantly greater in most of the bitou bush sites, whereas in the native vegetation there was more nitrogen held within the leaf litter layer. Nitrogen appears to be cycled faster in the weedy areas, mainly as result of the increase in leaf quality and the speed of breakdown. Leaf litter invertebrate abundance and assemblage were compared between habitats over twelve months. The total abundance was not significantly reduced in the weedy habitat but the abundance of mites, thrips, spiders, ants, and centipedes was reduced at many sites. The invertebrate assemblages also differed between habitats, with the C. monilifera supporting a lower diversity of beetles. However, the millipedes, amphipods, earthworms, pseudoscorpions and isopods appeared to respond positively to the invasion, occurring in higher abundance and detected more frequently in the weedy areas. This has been attributed to the change in microclimate within C. monilifera infestations, which are moister and darker, which these invertebrates tend to prefer. Furthermore as the leaf litter is of lower quantity and higher quality, and possibly higher palatability, than the native sclerophyllous vegetation, the detritivores assemblages seems to have responded positively. To determine the impact of the herbicide glyphosate on the non-target litter invertebrates control and impact sites were selected in coastal hind dunes heavily infested with C. monilifera. The impact sites were sprayed with a 1:100 dilution of Roundup(superscript R) Biactive (superscript TM). The herbicide application had no direct or indirect effect on leaf litter invertebrate abundance or community composition in the four months following application. The litter invertebrate assemblages were highly variable on a small spatial scale with abiotic factors more strongly regulating leaf litter invertebrate numbers than glyphosate application. These results conflict with previous studies, indicating the detrimental indirect effects herbicide application has on non-target litter invertebrates may depend upon the application rate, the vegetation community and structure and post spray weather. Invasion by C. monilifera has changed the movement of leaf litter and the cycling of nutrients within coastal ecosystems, mainly through a change in quality and quantity of leaf litter. It has impacted on the litter invertebrates, which has amplified the increase in decomposition rate. The change in soil nutrient availability could increase the competitive superiority of C. monilifera directly by increasing growth rate, or indirectly by impairing the establishment of native species.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friction induced plastic deformation of high polymer surfaces</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Philip Gregory</field><field name="description">Four standard glassy polymers are subjected to a classical single pass friction test by a spherical glass indenter. The plastic deformation of the polymers surfaces resulting from a single sliding pass was examined by scanning probe microscopy using intermittent contact mode. Debris were present on the surface of polymers with a low entanglement density following a single sliding pass. No debris were present on the surface of polymers with a high entanglement density following a single sliding pass. A relationship between entanglement density and debris production was confirmed by studying different crosslink densities of polystyrene. Localised plastic deformation occurring at the exposed surface region was proposed to explain the formation of debris. The friction of different crosslink densities of polystyrene was shown to be indifferent when measured by a glass indenter and by a silicon nitride scanning probe microscope tip.

We present here widefield observations of this region in the 21cm transition of HI. These observations are made using the ATCA and Parkes telescopes. The resulting dataset encompasses a spatial range of 98? &#65533; 7(degrees) and are at a velocity resolution of ~1.63 km s(superscript &#65533;1). This dataset has formed the basis for a series of analyses which are the subject of this thesis. The HI in the Bridge is seen to have a complex and filamentary structure across the entire range of observed spatial and velocity scales. A census of the expanding shell population, which were parameterised using a strict selection criteria, has resulted in the detection of a shell population with a mean kinematical age of 6.2 Myr. This is in general agreement with the shell population of the SMC, although is shown that the strict shell selection criteria was insensitive to fragmenting or incomplete shells. A strict selection criteria led to the detection of a region in the Bridge where an apparently older shell population exists. The HI of this region, found at Right Ascensions greater than approximately 2(superscript h)20, appears relatively quiescent. It appears that shells in this region may left to develop for a longer time before they are ruptured and distorted by ambient turbulence. A study of the spatial power spectrum has shown that distribution of structure in the Bridge is quite inhomogeneous. Two apparently different morphological regions are detected in the Bridge: the northern part is at a higher velocity and shows very little small scale variation and the southern, lower velocity and significantly brighter part shows an approximately Kolmogorov power spectrum. The power law index of the southern part is consistent with power indices derived from HI in the SMC. The power spectrum of both the northern and southern part are well fit using a single component, and show no indication for a dominant scale. Visually, the southern part of the Bridge appears to suggest a east-west elongation in the structure. This is not apparent in a quantitative test of the Fourier transform of the image data. A smaller-scale analysis using the Spectral Correlation Function, which provides a measurement of the variation of spectra as a function of spatial lag, suggests that the spectra do in fact vary more slowly in the East-West direction, i.e. approximately along the line joining the SMC and LMC. Several large scale features found in the Bridge show evidence for large energy deposition events. Part of the HI in the Bridge appears to be distinctly offset in velocity and position and a comparison of numerical N-Body simulations of the Magellanic System, where the SMC is modelled as a spiral galaxy, shows excellent agreement with the observed HI distribution, both in position and in velocity. From these simulations, it appears that the velocity offset part of the Bridge is in fact a distant arm of the SMC while the closer arm comprises a link between the LMC-SMC. The observed filamentary nature of the lower velocity component is consistent with severe turbulent mixing which may be generated by the tidal interaction of the SMC and LMC. The brighter, lower velocity part of the Bridge is shown to have a bimodal spectral profile. The bimodality is contiguous in position and in velocity with a shell complex in the SMC. The observed bimodality in the Bridge indicates that the Bridge formed after the formation of the SMC shell complex, however the kinematical ages for the shell complex are a factor of ~15 younger than the predicted age of the Bridge structure. A large radii (~1.6 kpc) loop filament is observed off the North-Eastern corner of the SMC. The velocity structure of the loop is reminiscent of an expanding region, although the energy requirements for this shell are so extreme that no current hole or shell formation theories can satisfactorily account for its development. Such a feature would require an unseen massive stellar association to generate the necessary energy output. To form the observed feature by a high velocity cloud collision would require the impinging mass to have velocities and densities which are entirely inconsistent with the observed HVC population. Finally, the idea that the loop occurs at the first gravitational Lagrange point of the LMC-SMC system is inconsistent with Numerical simulations in that the simulations suggest that the loop is in fact located in the distant spiral arm of the SMC and therefore not in the correct location of L1 point. Furthermore, the simulations do not show any evidence for the formation of this feature as observed. As such, the formation mechanism for this significant, large-scale loop is still uncertain. A survey of H? emission regions throughout the Bridge, using a new and untested H&#65533; dataset, has isolated several new H? emission regions. In general, these H? regions appear to be spatially associated with UV sources from the FAUST catalogue, although in some cases the H&#65533; emission region show a morphology which is characteristic of formation by collisional heating. Some of the H&#65533; features which show a ring-like morphology are compared with the HI dataset. In this way, an estimate of the age of the shell can be made. Due to calibration difficulties, and a lack of continuum information, this part of the thesis comprises only a list of positions of the H? features and a discussion of possible ionisation mechanisms. A search for (superscript 12)CO(1-0) emissions regions in the Bridge has resulted in the first detection of this molecule in the Magellanic Brodge. The CO emission region appears to be embedded in an HI cloud and has a S(subscript 60)/S(subscript 100) which is similar to those found in the SMC. The marrow line width of the Bridge CO detection is consistent with a low metallicity, indicating that the HI in the Bridge is less evolved than that of the SMC or the Magellanic Stream. From empirical models based on analyses of CO emission regions in the SMC, an upper limit of the radius of this region is estimated at ~16 pc.

It presents a study of how the party &#8220;reinvented&#8221; itself as a &#8220;New Labor&#8221; Party during this time, how this process occurred and who was most responsible for this fundamental change in the Party&#8217;s philosophy. As a necessary precursor to examining these two central themes, an analysis was undertaken of the foundations and philosophy of social democratic parties. In particular, the unique type of social democratic party that evolved in Australia, based on the notion of Labourism, is outlined. Through this examination, an appreciation emerges of the philosophical underpinnings, historical evolution and policies of the Australian Labor Party from its creation. Any study of Australia&#8217;s economic history must consider the relationship between banking and the Australian Labor Party. Accordingly, the evolution of Australia&#8217;s financial system, and how Labor&#8217;s policies and platforms for decades reflected outright antagonism towards banks, is presented. Issues such as the Money Power, creation of the Commonwealth Bank, bank nationalisation and financial deregulation all provide a background to Labor&#8217;s modernising agenda in the 1980s and 1990s. The thesis uses financial deregulation to examine how and why Labor embraced nontraditional, market-oriented economic policies during the Hawke/Keating Governments. It considers three case studies of financial deregulation in detail: the float of the dollar, the entry of foreign banks, and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. In doing so, this analysis concludes that financial deregulation became part of a wider process of modernising the Australian Labor Party. Each of the case studies examines the roles of various actors along this modernisation path to elicit an understanding of the magnitude of the changes to the Party&#8217;s economic policy. The roles of Cabinet, Caucus, National Cnference, National Executive and the factions presents a unique insight into a Party embracing fundamental change. Using the writer&#8217;s inside knowledge as a member of the Hawke/Keating Governments, and drawing on the recollections of past and present Parliamentary colleagues, bankers, Party officials and advisers, the study concludes that Labor&#8217;s embrace of deregulatory economic policies did create a &#8220;new-style&#8221; Labor Party. Most credit for this philosophical leap of faith is given to Paul Keating, whose intellectual drive and sheer persistence saw Labor become a modern, outward-looking and relevant political party. The study has taken many secondary accounts of the ways in which policies were developed under the Hawke and Keating Governments and subjected them to rigorous analysis. The writer&#8217;s position as a participant in the government, as an author of elements of financial deregulation policies, and as a person with access to many of the major actors, ensures that the study makes a unique contribution to the understanding of policy development processes in the Labor Governments of the 1980s and 1990s.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector deficits and macroeconomic performance in Lebanon</field><field name="creator">Saleh, Ali Salman</field><field name="description">The major aims of this study are as follows. First, to macro model prospective developments in the Lebanese economy for policy analysis and evaluation. The main purpose of this study is to develop a dynamic macroeconomic model for Lebanon including the budget deficit and the funding of it, as well as the composition of government expenditures (capital or current). Hence this study develops behavioural equations not used before for Lebanon. The model developed emphasises the effects of exogenous shocks arising from budget deficits and the funding of it (e.g. monetary accommodation or bond financing). This macroeconomic model is utilised as well to analyse the effects of exogenous shocks arising from increased government expenditures (capital expenditure or consumption expenditure) upon key macroeconomic variables. The current government&#8217;s policy approach as well as the separate government policies in response to the Lebanese fiscal crisis is analysed as well through the use of this macroeconomic model. The second aim of this study is the application of estimation techniques to Lebanese data. This study generates parameter values of key macroeconomic behavioural relationships in the context of Lebanon by using efficient estimation techniques and appropriate data definitions for Lebanon. This represents a new contribution to the literature, since there have not been any empirical studies on such relationships in the case of Lebanon. The third aim of this study is the application of a simulation analysis to the Lebanese economy. This study conducts a numerical simulation analysis of the macroeconomic model developed, in order to analyse a number of economic policies in the context of the Lebanese fiscal crisis with the aim of improving the country&#8217;s macroeconomic performance. Since there has been no research in the area of simulation and policy analysis for the case of Lebanon, this research makes a major contribution to the literature and to an understanding of the Lebanese economy. The model developed in this study is based on the contributions of the Dornbusch model (DB) (1976), the portfolio balance model (PBM) (Branson (1977, 1984) including the work of Dornbusch and Fisher (1980). The model also  ncorporates the work of Harvie and Kearney (HKM) (1996). The DB and PBM models have a number of deficiencies, especially the neglect of the supply side of the economy; no wealth effects; no funding implications from fiscal deficits; and a lack of stock-flow interactions, among others. The model developed attempted to remedy these deficiencies by incorporating the supply side of the economy, wealth effects, capital stock accumulation, alternative ways of funding the budget deficit and the composition of  government expenditures (capital or current). Hence, many amendments have made to these existing models in order to make the model developed more applicable to the case of Lebanon, especially to analyse the impact of the composition of budget funding and the composition of government expenditures shocks on macroeconomic variables. Because of a lack, or unavailability, of parameter values for key macroeconomic behavioural relationships in the context of Lebanon, and the need for these parameters values in the conduct of a simulation analysis, this study empirically estimated the behavioural equations of the macroeconomic model developed by using efficient testimation techniques (FIML, ECM) and appropriate data definitions for Lebanon. The results from the FIML approach indicated the existence of long run relationships, or cointegration, for all the equations employed. The findings of cointegration allow us to investigate the dynamics of the system with the information of the cointegration relationship, and an error-correction model (ECM) is estimated. Hence these estimates (the long run and short run estimated coefficients from cointegration and the error correction model) provide a range of possible parameters values, which are used to conduct a simulation and policy analysis in chapter 7. The parameter values estimated make a unique contribution to the literature, since there are no other empirical studies analysing such behavioural relationships in the case of Lebanon. In addition, this study examined the time series data to find out whether the series are stationary or non-stationary, by using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. The results showed that only real private consumption expenditure ( c p ), real government investment spending ( i g ), rate of change of real bonds stock (b&amp;&#8722; p&amp;) , real government expenditure (g) and real private investment spending ( i p ) seem to be stationary I(0). The rest of the variables included in the model are found to be non-stationary of different orders, either I(1) or I(2). The major findings from the simulation results presented in this study are that, implementing the policy of expansion in government capital expenditure, for two presumed cases (unanticipated/gradual), produces larger favourable impacts upon Lebanese economic development in terms of private sector investment, and in terms of the supply side of the economy (crowding in effects) during the whole adjustment process towards long run steady state. This policy produces, as well, favourable impacts in terms of external developments. Implementing the policy of an expansion in government consumption expenditure produces unfavourable effects in terms of external developments during the djustment process. The trade balance deteriorates in line with a deterioration in foreign asset stocks as a result of current account deficits, and hence results in an increase in foreign debt. This policy produces, as well, unfavourable effect in terms of private investment and aggregate supply (crowding out effect). Implementing the two policies (expansion in capital expenditure/government consumption expenditure) produces similar outcomes in terms of the interest rate and the rate of inflation. However, both policies produce higher inflation during the short run period. The interest rate is higher as well during the first year of the short run period due to the increase in public spending arising from the funding component through bond sales. However, the simulation results for the two policies show that money deficit financing is inflationary and shows large sensitivity in terms of the interest rate. Bond financing is non inflationary and shows little sensitivity in terms of interest rates. The main finding is that if the government considers a fiscal expansion policy in order to improve macroeconomic performance, the simulation results suggest that the government should adopt the policy of an expansion in capital expenditure because it produces the most desirable outcomes. In addition, it should adopt a gradual approach because this produces considerably less volatility in terms of major macro variables. The main findings from our simulation results dealing with the government approach to the fiscal crisis, does not support the government policy in dealing with the crisis. The results presented suggest that it produces the most undesirable economic outcomes, and hence will only exacerbate Lebanon&#8217;s economic difficulties. However, if the Lebanese government is willing to go ahead with this approach, it is advised that, based upon the results presented and in order to minimise the adverse effects of this policy, the government should adopt a gradual approach because it leads to much less macroeconomic volatility. Another important conclusion is that the government in Lebanon should be aware that the reduction in government expenditures, in order to reduce the budget deficit, is not the best strategy and especially the policy of reduction in government capital expenditure. If the government in Lebanon decides to implement the policy of expansionary monetary policy in order to reduce the budget deficit, our results show that this policy will have some positive effect on Lebanon&#8217;s economy, but the government has to be aware that this policy has an inflationary effect.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation and degradation aspects of ballast and constitutive modelling under cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Salim, Md Wadud</field><field name="description">This thesis contains laboratory  experimental results of strength, deformation and particle breakage of fresh and recycled ballast under monotonic and cyclic loadings, experimental evaluation of effectiveness of various geosynthetics in stabilising recycled ballast, and a new stress-strain constitutive model for ballast incorporating particle breakage. Ballast degrades progressively under heavy cyclic rail loadings, leading to deterioration of track substructure, rail alignment and train safety. Severely fouled ballast is often removed from the track and replaced by freshly quarried ballast, causing track maintenance very costly. Discarded ballast can be cleaned, sieved and recycled to track foundation. In this study, the shear strength and stiffness of both fresh and recycled ballast were investigated in a series of consolidated drained shearing tests using a large-scale triaxial apparatus. The degree of particle breakage was quantified by sieving the ballast specimens before and after each test and recording the changes in ballast gradation. The stress-strain, shear strength, stiffness and particle breakage results of recycled ballast were compared with fresh ballast. The crushing strength characteristics of fresh and recycled ballast grains were investigated in a series of single grain crushing tests on various particle sizes. A small track section comprising rail, sleeper, ballast, capping and subgrade was simulated in a large prismoidal triaxial apparatus in the laboratory. The settlement, lateral deformation and particle breakage behaviour of fresh and recycled ballast under field-simulated loading and boundary conditions were studied in a series of cyclic loading tests using the prismoidal triaxial rig. Three types of geosynthetics (geogrid, woven-geotextile and geocomposite) were used in this study to stabilise recycled ballast. The cyclic test results of recycled ballast stabilised with geosynthetics were compared with the fresh and recycled ballast without geosynthetics. In order to study the effect of saturation, the cyclic tests were conducted in both dry and wet conditions. Currently, there is a lack of appropriate stress-strain constitutive models for coarse aggregates like ballast, especially under cyclic loading incorporating particle breakage. The new constitutive model developed in this study incorporates the energy consumption due to particle breakage during shearing. A single non-linear function has been formulated to model particle breakage, and incorporated in the plastic flow rule assuming non-associated flow. The model has been developed based on the critical state framework and the concept of bounding surface plasticity. It captures the strainhardening, post-peak strain-softening, dilatancy and cyclic hardening features of ballast behaviour accurately. The model has been examined and verified against the experimental results. Finite element analyses using ABAQUS were also conducted to compare with the analytical model. This study clearly shows that the new constitutive model predicts the stress-strain, volume change and particle breakage of ballast to an acceptable accuracy for both monotonic and cyclic loadings.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isoleucine epimerisation and stable isotope ratio studies of cassowary, megapode and aepyornis eggshells: biogeochemical and palaeonenvironmental implications</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Simon James</field><field name="description">Previous researchers have used the extent of isoleucine epimerisation and stable carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotope ratios of ostrich (Struthio), emu (Dromaius) and Genyornis eggshells to provide geochronological control and palaeoenvironmental information on the Quaternary sequences from which these sample types are recovered. This thesis expanded this field of research by examining isoleucine epimerisation and the stable isotopes ratios of cassowary (Casuarius), megapode (principally the Australian brushturkey, Alectura lathami) and Aepyornis eggshells. The aims of the research were to (1) increase our understanding of the ancient habitats of Casuarius, megapodes and Aepyornis in order to provide information on how these ecosystems functioned, as well as the nature and timing of the environmental change they have experienced, and (2) to document the amino acid and stable isotope biogeochemistry of avian eggshells in novel contexts in order to better understand the processes that influence these attributes.Samples of Casuarius, Alectura lathami and Aepyornis eggshells were heated at high temperatures (110, 143 and 160 &#186;C). These experiments were used to determine the temperature sensitivity of isoleucine epimerisation in these eggshell types, expressed in terms of Arrhenius parameters, and to characterise the thermal stability of amino acids. In the stratified archaeological sequences of To&#233; Cave, Kria Cave (Ayamaru Plateau, West Papua, Indonesia), Liang Lemdubu and Nabulei Lisa (Aru Islands, Arafura Sea, Indonesia) exposure to short-term high temperature heating events associated with campfires complicated interpretation of the extent of isoleucine epimerisation in Casuarius and megapode eggshells in terms of time and temperature. The extent of isoleucine epimerisation in Alectura lathami eggshells from Hay Cave (northeastern Queensland, Australia) enhanced the geochronological control for this site by clarifying the presence of temporal breaks in the sequence and providing an age estimate for a section of the sequence lacking age control. Late Holocene and Pleistocene populations of Aepyornis eggshells from the southern and southwestern coasts of Madagascar were readily distinguished by the extent of isoleucine epimerisation they exhibit.Relatively high stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (_13C and _18O values) in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Aru Islands were consistent with a weaker monsoon during the Last Glacial Maximum. The absence of this trend in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Ayamaru Plateau suggested the latter site is less sensitive to fluctuations in monsoon effectiveness. Supported by isotope analyses of modern megapode eggshells, carbon fixed by C3 photosynthesis was identified at the base of the Alectura food chain from the _13C values of Hay Cave megapode eggshells. The interpretation of Alectura eggshell _18O values was complicated by their wide range, and this was most likely a product of the combined effects of evaporation on oxygen isotope ratios and the protracted breeding season. The lack of variation in the _13C and _18O values of Aepyornis eggshells was attributed to subsistence on C3 vegetation and the water of perennial groundwater-fed ponds, whereas enriched nitrogen isotope ratios could be due to a number of factors including the infiltration of seawater into the littoral water table.Overall, the research presented an opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of information extrapolated from isoleucine epimerisation and isotope ratios in avian eggshells in novel taxonomic and geographical settings. The high temperature experiments further documented the taxonomic dependency of the rate of isoleucine epimerisation in avian eggshells and indicated that the temperature sensitivity of this reaction is similar amongst eggshells. Although interpreting the extent of isoleucine epimerisation in eggshells from archaeological sites in terms of time and temperature was readily complicated by exposure to campfire heating events, the ability to demonstrate a close correlation with independent age control indicated that this problem is not ubiquitous in these contexts. The _13C values of eggshells broadly identified the vegetation that herbivorous birds consumed, and where the photosynthetic pathway of this vegetation was known, eggshell _13C values provided information on the _13C value of this biomass. The nitrogen isotope ratios of eggshells could be successfully integrated with existing knowledge of ancient habitats, and eggshell _ values were used to identify drinking water sources and trace climatically-significant changes in these reservoirs over time.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution, devolution, revolution? An analysis of the legal and administrative arrangements for catchment and water planning in South Australia and New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Mooney, Carla Joan</field><field name="description">The sustainable management of private agricultural land requires a shift in the approach to decision making about natural resources, improved regulation and better integration. There has been substantial legal reform in the area of natural resource management over the last ten years. This reform is particularly evident in the introduction of legal processes for catchment and water planning. Catchment and water planning is concerned with both setting 'management' priorities and generating 'rules' in relation to access to natural resources. Planning in this context can be viewed as both a process and a product. In broad terms the planning process involves the collection and analysis of environmental, economic and social data and consultation with the community about both needs and means to achieve change. The product i.e. plans, specify parameters, priorities, rules, implementation tools and review mechanisms. This research involved an analysis of the legal and administrative arrangements for catchment and water planning in South Australia and New South Wales and a review of its implementation in two coastal catchments i.e. the Onkaparinga (SA) and the Southern (NSW). The specific questions addressed were: Do these arrangements facilitate sustainable management? Are they resulting in better regulation? and Is there an increase in the level of integration? The literature on sustainability was examined to help define the key elements of a planning framework. This formed the basis for the analysis of the catchment and water planning legislation. Regulatory theory literature was examined to provide a further framework for analysis. This is a study of the 'law in context'. The case study method was used.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid adaptive programming using image data</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Alexander</field><field name="description">This work was initiated to address the problem of automated weld repair in a specific application; namely hydro turbine cavitation damage. An extensive review of the application requirements was undertaken and this highlighted the need for a new approach to robot programming. This thesis therefore focused on the development of a novel rapid programming technique based on a vision system. The implementation involved the development of algorithms to correlate robot and vision system coordinates, communication links to the system hardware, and a software environment to &#8216;manage&#8217; the process. The complete system was successfully validated by representative trials on a full-size hydro turbine mock-up. Several investigations examining different industrial applications such as the weld repair of hydro turbine runners in the power generation industry and weld repair of crawler shoes in the mining sector have demonstrated the feasibility of using robot technology. However, limitations have been identified in these investigations that continue to impede the widespread acceptance and use of this technology in industry. An offline programming technique was developed in this thesis that addresses some of these limitations, and seeks to improve confidence in robotic systems for &#8216;one-off&#8217; or small batch run applications. OH&amp;S regulations were found to be the significant driver in developing systems for insitu repair by robot. Small commercial robots are available that partially satisfy the requirements for in-situ use; however, a fast means of robot programming and the ability to handle uniquely damaged shapes at arbitrary locations remains unsolved. These have been appropriately addressed in the current work with the development of an automatic adaptive system capable of rapid robot programming and online process control via an intuitive, user-friendly PC-based interface. Various sensor technologies and profilometry tools and techniques were reviewed. Based on simplicity, cost, and availability, the most promising approaches identified were touch-sensing or non-laser-based vision for profilometry, followed by offline robot programming based on the acquired data. In this thesis, image acquisition was achieved using a low-cost CCD camera, damaged areas were identified, and weld paths automatically generated. A combined and integrated profilometry and offline programming technique was devised in conjunction with a robotic system incorporating touch-sensing. The speed of the system developed in this thesis enables positional repair welds of unique shape to commence within minutes, making the prospect of &#8216;one-off&#8217; repairs commercially viable. The technique developed is suitable for the target application; hydro turbine cavitation repair, but can be easily extended to many other wear replacement scenarios commonly found in industry.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of collegiality in the professional development of principals</field><field name="creator">Armour, Lenore</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a case study of the nature of collegiality and how it was established and sustained by a peer-support group of Australian principals over a period of seventeen years as a result of their participation in a Commonwealth Schools Commission professional development course designated as a Project of National Significance. The major research question was as follows: &#8216;How did the involvement of a group of principals in a collegial-based leadership program contribute to their professional development and social, and emotional well-being?&#8217; The researcher has been a participant in the group from its inception. The case study was constructed from historical and contextual data collected through an analysis of education documents and group artefacts, such as faxes, diaries and photographs, through interviews with key stakeholders such as course designers, consultants and through the use of data from a questionnaire on the concept of collegiality and its sustainability. Contemporary data were collected through individual interviews with the participants in the peer-support group and through participant constructed narratives. Propositions about the nature and changing conditions of collegiality, as experienced by participants in the group, which were derived from an analysis of these data, were clarified through surveys and focus group interviews. As a result of this process of analysis, an &#8216;ideal type&#8217; of collegiality, captured by the concept of coadunation, was depicted as a model. Structural, behavioural/attitudinal and cultural conditions of collegiality were identified as operating through four stages of the changing group purpose. Some conditions of collegiality were found to have been sustained over a period of seventeen years while others gradually disappeared according to the professional and personal needs of the group. A significant outcome of the case study is the evidence that professional development, based on the central notion of a collegial community of peers, provided the conditions that empowered principals to use reflection, action research and problemsolving strategies in their own learning. This model of professional development was paramount in assisting the principals to achieve their professional goals and enhanced their personal development of attitudes and behaviours that supported collegial practices. In addition, the collegial group, which endured beyond the original training course, played a central role in promoting the welfare of the principals, through their access to a group of supportive, non-judgmental peers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triaxial behaviour of ballast and the role of confining pressure under cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Lackenby, Joanne</field><field name="description">Traditional railway foundations or substructures, consisting of one or two granular layers overlying a subgrade or natural formation, have become increasingly overloaded in recent years due to the utilisation of faster and heavier trains. During this period, there has been little, if any, re-engineering of the substructure in Australia, resulting in maintenance cycles becoming more frequent and increasingly expensive. Finding economical and practical techniques for enhancing the stability and safety of the substructure, thereby ensuring a capacity for supporting further increases in load, is vital in securing the long-term viability of the railway industry. The load bearing ballast is located directly below the sleepers and is responsible for limiting the stresses projected onto the weaker subgrade and preventing train-induced sleeper movement. Two significant ballast problems arising from increasing axle loads are differential settlement and degradation. It is thought that substructure enhancement can be attained and these problems largely curtailed through the manipulation of the level of effective confining pressure supporting the ballast layer. To investigate this possibility, a series of large-scale, high-frequency, drained, cyclic triaxial tests were conducted to examine the deformation (permanent and resilient) and degradation response of railway ballast. It was identified that the level of lateral confining pressure should be considered as an important design parameter. Two of the major benefits arising from increased confinement are reduced lateral movement (spreading) and vertical settlement resulting in improved line and level, and superior track stiffness and associated enhancements in ride comfort for passengers. The major drawback in the event of excessive confinement is unacceptable levels of particle breakage. The experimental results indicated, however, that insufficient confining pressure is as damaging in terms of particle breakdown as excessive pressure, and that minimal degradation will be achieved at some intermediate value. For maximum deviator stress magnitudes of 230, 500 and 750 kPa, 'optimum' breakage conditions were encountered within the confining pressure ranges 15 &#65533; 65, 25 &#65533; 95, and 50 &#65533; 140 kPa, respectively. Practical methods of increasing the in-situ track confinement are suggested and evaluated in terms of ease of installation, effectiveness and cost. It is concluded that the more superior methods of achieving increased confining pressure are by reinforcing the ballast using geosynthetics, or by increasing the effective overburden pressure through increased shoulder and/or crib height or via the achievement of a higher initial ballast density (greater compaction).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the fabrication and characterisation of high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 thin films</field><field name="creator">Li, Aihua</field><field name="description">Thin films of the high temperature superconductor (HTS) YBa2Cu3O7 (Y123) are of great potential in a wide range of applications, including low-loss microwave cavities and filters, bolometers, various superconducting terminal devices, flux transformers, and dc and rf superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). They also have the potential to give insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing high temperature superconductivity. Y123 coated conductors, the so-called second generation superconducting tapes, which are based on Y123 thin film technology, also have great applications in carrying large superconducting currents. However, some important challenges or fundamental problems hindering their practical applications need to be solved scientifically. These include: finding the most effective and economic approaches to enhance the superconducting critical current density in high magnetic fields; reducing the fabrication cost with high reproducibility; arriving at a profound understanding of the relationship between microstructure and superconducting performance, etc. The work described in this thesis deals with these challenges, with an emphasis on fundamental studies on supercurrent enhancement through nanotechnology and nanoengineering using advanced thin film fabrication methods, including pulsed laser deposition and spin coating, and on the relationship between microstructure and supercurrent performance.An overview of the research on HTS thin films in the period from 2000 to the end of 2005 is given in Chapter I. Attention was paid to both Y123 films and coated conductors fabricated using both PLD and chemical methods, on both single crystal and metallic substrates. The related electrical and magnetic properties are also reviewed. In the first part of the thesis work, Y123 thin films with and without Ag nanoparticle inclusions were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on YSZ (100), SrTiO3 (100), and LaAlO3 (100) single crystal substrates. A discontinuous layer of Ag nanodots was deposited on the substrates prior to the deposition of Y123 films. The Y123 films grown on such surfaces modified with Ag nanodots were extensively characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), AC susceptibility and DC magnetisation. The effects of the density of Ag nanodots, which was controlled by the numbers of PLD shots, on the microstructures and resultant critical current density Jc have been studied systematically. Results showed that under fixed physical deposition conditions Jc increased monotonically with the number of Ag shots, n, for films grown on both STO and LAO substrates. At 77 K, the Jc increased from 106 to 3.2 &#215;106 A/cm2 for LAO and from 8&#215;105 to 3.5&#215;106 A/cm2 for STO as n increased from 0 to 150. At 5 K, the Jc was enhanced by approximately four times at both low and high fields. These values obtained due to nano-Ag inclusions are comparable to the best results achieved by other prestigious research groups around the world. However, for films grown on YSZ substrate, Jc increased from 2&#215;105 to 2&#215;106 A/cm2 as Ag shots increased from 0 to 30, and decreased to 9&#215;105 for n &#179; 60. Detailed microstructure investigations indicated that the crystallinity and ab alignment gradually improved as the number of Ag-nano-dots increased. In the second part of the thesis work, YBa2Cu3Oy films were grown on single crystalline YSZ, SrTiO3, and MgO, and on polycrystalline Ag substrates using non-fluorine sol-gel and spin coating methods. The effects of heat treatment conditions on the phase evolution and microstructures were investigated using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. A detailed study was performed on the phase formation, degree of grain orientation, formation of cracks, and surface morphologies. It was found that sintering temperature and roughness of substrate surfaces are two key factors in controlling crack morphologies. With several important advantages, including precursor solution stability, improved film density, and elimination of HF during processing, high-quality YBCO films have been achieved on single crystal substrates with transport critical current densities up to 106 A/cm2. An extensive study was carried out on the alteration of precursor solution stoichiometry and its effects on superconducting properties. Fluorine-free sol-gel&#8211;derived films on the LAO substrate exhibited epitaxial growth with excellent in- and out-of-plane texture. Experimental details are given on the sol-gel synthesis chemistry and XRD and TEM characterization of the YBCO thin films.The phase evolution of YBCO films prepared by the fluorine-free sol-gel method was also systematically investigated using in-situ high temperature optical microscope observations and x-ray diffraction. The conversion sequences and the final resultant products have been determined for barium, copper and yttrium containing precursors, respectively. It was found that those conversions are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions such as water partial pressure. The formation of YBCO starts at a temperature of around 710 oC and lasts up to 800 oC over about 15 min. Depending on the barium containing phases and experimental conditions. It is suggested that a- and caxis YBCO grains are governed by different reactions.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic analysis of the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behaviour and the technology acceptance model when applied to the prediction and explanation of information systems use in mandatory usage contexts</field><field name="creator">Rawstorne, Patrick</field><field name="description">Socio-cognitive theories such as the 'theory of reasoned action' (TRA), the 'theory of planned behaviour' (TPB), and the 'technology acceptance model' (TAM) have provided researchers with a theoretical framework to guide many of the studies that have sought to predict and explain end-user adoption and acceptance of information systems. Many of these studies were conducted in usage contexts in which individuals had a choice about their use of an information system. However, the increasing trend among organisations to computerise their work places has changed the scope of work activity. More industries are now requiring their employees to use an information system and to do so in prescribed ways. This amounts to mandatory usage. These workplace trends pose conceptual/theoretical, methodological and research validation issues for the use of the TRA, TAM and TPB. A conceptual/theoretical issue that threatens to challenge the validity of the TRA and TAM in mandatory information systems (IS) usage contexts is based on the notion that mandatory behaviour is outside an individual's volitional control. If this is the case, it clashes with an underpinning assumption of the TRA and TAM that these theories were designed to predict and explain behaviours under volitional control. The TPB, on the other hand, has been suggested as a solution to this potential problem as it has the theoretical capacity to predict and explain behaviours low in volitional control. Despite these problematic issues, there is a paucity of published studies in the IS literature that have addressed mandatory usage within the framework of the socio-cognitive theories. Of the rare studies that have addressed mandatory usage, most were based around the framework of the TAM. There is also an absence of IS research that has examined the assumption that mandatory behaviours are low in volitional control. One of the methodological concerns about using the TRA, TAM and TPB in mandatory IS usage contexts was that the key variable for predicting behaviour in these theories was considered potentially unsuitable in mandatory contexts. In the general literature, and to a lesser extent in the IS literature, usage intentions are strongly associated with behaviour. Due to the paucity of studies based in a mandatory usage context, it was unclear whether the association between usage intentions and behaviour would be weakened when the usage context was mandatory. There was reason to expect that it would be weakened. The reasoning was based on the view that if a potential end-user was asked whether they intended to perform a mandatory behaviour they would be likely to answer in the affirmative. It was proposed that a way of overcoming a skewed measure of usage intentions would be to replace that variable with another that was less likely to be skewed but which would still be capable of predicting behaviour. One variable that appeared to fit these criteria was symbolic adoption, which refers to the extent to which a potential end-user has mentally accepted the adoption of an IS as a good idea and is enthusiastic about using it. Another methodological concern was that in mandatory usage contexts it was considered neither sufficient nor sensible to measure usage behaviour based on whether people used the system or not (i.e., no/yes). It was argued that it would be potentially more important to have a dependent variable that measured aspects of usage behaviour. Moreover, since usage behaviour is multidimensional (Doll &amp; Torkzadeh, 1998), there would be benefits to organizations if the TRA, TAM and TPB could predict and explain multiple IS usage behaviours. To date, there is a relative absence of IS research that has examined the capacity of these three theories to predict and explain multiple mandatory usage behaviours prospectively. The major research question in the thesis sought to determine whether the TRA, TAM and TPB would predict and explain multiple prospective mandatory IS usage behaviours. A secondary research question examined whether the skewness in a measure of usage intentions would hamper the successful prediction and explanation of mandatory behaviour and, if so, whether symbolic adoption would outperform usage intentions in the prediction and explanation of usage behaviour. To answer these research questions, a series of studies was conducted using a strict methodology that involved testing the three theories true to theory by constructing scales for the TRA and TPB based on salient beliefs that were elicited from a subset of each sample; writing questionnaire items consistent with Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980) correspondence rules in action, context, target and time; and employing a longitudinal design in which the measurement of usage intentions and usage behaviour were separated in time. Four studies were conducted in two types of organisations: (i) an Australian university, and (ii) Australian hospitals. Each study was conducted solely in the one type of organisation (either a university or a hospital) and was focused solely on one type of IS in each organisation. End-users were undergraduate students and nurses, in the university and hospital environments respectively. IS usage behaviours were the dependent variables that the three theories were being tested to predict and explain. Although the type of software varied across the studies, personal computers formed the hardware in each study. The degree to which the adoption and usage environments were mandatory varied across the studies. Participants completed questionnaires on two occasions: before implementation and after they had been using the system for about two to three months. The structural models for the three theories were analysed using structural equation modelling with partial least squares estimation. The results showed that despite the skewness in the measure of usage intentions, the TRA, TAM and TPB significantly predicted and explained prospective mandatory IS usage behaviour, albeit by explaining a relatively small amount of variance in behaviour. This weaker explanation of behaviour in comparison with other studies in the IS literature was attributed to predicting prospective, rather than current or retrospective, behaviour as well as predicting multiple, rather than single, IT usage behaviours. An unexpected finding was that when mandatory and voluntary usage behaviours were compared in the same study, the mandatory behaviour was predicted and explained more successfully than the voluntary usage behaviour. It was concluded that mandatory behaviour may be more stable than voluntary behaviour in the early stages of an IS implementation. This characteristic may mean that mandatory behaviours can be predicted more successful longitudinally than voluntary behaviours. While many end-users had strong intentions to use the particular IS in each study, a sizeable proportion had negative attitudes about such use. To examine whether these end-users developed positive attitudes about the IS after using the system, as suggested by cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), Study 4 compared pre and post-implementation perceptions about the IS. The results were counter to the research hypothesis. Rather than showing improved attitudes and perceptions of the usefulness and ease with which the system could be used, participants' attitudes and perceptions of usefulness decreased over time. This decrease was attributed to overselling the benefits of the IS to employees, which may have created expectations that could not be matched by subsequent use of the IS. In comparing the three theories across the four studies, each explained a similar amount of variance in usage behaviour. However, the TPB explained the most variance in usage intentions. The TAM was the easiest model to apply, since the scales did not have to be constructed from elicited beliefs, as they did for the TRA and TPB. The choice of these three theories and associated models will therefore depend on the priorities of the researcher or stakeholder. Finally, this thesis has conceptually clarified and empirically verified that the type of volitional control that may be absent when usage is mandatory, is a different volitional control than was envisaged by Ajzen (1985, 1991) when he developed the TPB. As such, the TPB may perform as well in voluntary usage contexts as it does when usage is mandatory.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An implementation of multiplayer online game with distributed server architecture</field><field name="creator">Liang, Dingliang</field><field name="description">The distribution of game servers has received serious attention in recent years. A multi-server structure may distribute the load of the server, as well as improve the fairness of games played over large geographical distances without sacrificing delay. However, while distributing the game authority, the system takes risk of game state inconsistency between servers. Mechanisms are presented to provide synchronization between servers. However, user response to these mechanisms for maintaining server consistency in different game types is largely unknown. This thesis aims to study the user responses to two of the important synchronization techniques, Local Lag and Timewarp, within a real network game. To do this we developed a platform based on a common First Person Shooter (FPS) game called Quake III Arena. The platform is able to simulate various distributed server systems. With the platform we examines the impacts of using local lag/timewarp upon computer-controlled players (bots) performance in distributed network game. According to our experimental results it is probable to gain the optimal point of bots performance with constant network lag while using Local Lag and Timewarp together. To discuss the probable difference between human players and bots, and to examine the practicability of using the bot system to simulate human players' behaviors, we perform experiments with the participation of human players, and compare the results between bots/human players performance while under the same network conditions. The two groups of results shows significant similarities. Finally, in order to analyze and arrange the synchronization of distributed system more efficiently, we present Virtual Server Shifting Theory. We first demonstrate the - i - practicability of applying this theory within the distributed server system based on the mirrored server system, and then generalize the conclusions to more complex distributed server network topologies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theatre internationalisation: a Vietnamese perspective</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Dinh Thi</field><field name="description">During the last century, there have been many international theatrical exchanges which provided theatre practitioners with a wide range of opportunities to adapt and borrow elements or techniques from one theatre culture to apply to another. However, the question remains, whether this process is a collaboration in which 'foreign' elements equally exist with the original tradition, creating a new form or are they assimilated into the tradition and absorbed by it? Do 'foreign' elements remain foreign, used within familiar structures? In this thesis I map out a conceptual framework for analysing a number of related practices in adapting and borrowing techniques from various theatre forms to integrate into one's own form. I define this process as a concept of theatre internationalisation. This study of theatre internationalisation explores the experiences and practices of theatricals from Vietnam, together with a wide variety of other theatre cultures, in order to develop my own approach to practising the concept of internationalisation in theatre. Through analysing theatre works of international and Vietnamese directors and theoreticians I search for my own creative practice as a Vietnamese theatre director.

The study is motivated by the need for grammatical descriptions of Japanese discourse for teaching Japanese as a Second/Foreign Language. Descriptions of how Japanese organises textually, as a coherent message, are limited, with most work centred on clause level descriptions. This study looks at the resources of textual organisation above the clause.This study investigates the proposition that in Japanese, the clause is patterned in a motivated manner in its discourse environment and that this patterning correlates with the organisation of discourse.The theoretical resources of the Systemic Functional model of language are used to investigate these patterns above clause rank. In order to capture the organisational patterns above the clause, the study utilizes the T-unit or Theme-unit (Fries 1995c), the use of which can account for the operation of co-referential ellipsis and clause chaining in Japanese.The corpus of this study consists of eight instances of five separate genres. The five genres are 1) the factual news commentary, 2) the hard news story, 3) the soft news story, 4) the nursery tale and 5) the narrative. Each instance is segmented into T-units. The order of the constituents within the T-units in each text is quantified. The quantitative results indicate that the choice of what is selected as first in the Tunit is significant and equates with Theme. The system of THEME as it appears in the corpus is thus described. Following the description of the system of THEME, each text in the corpus is examined for patterns which demonstrate that the choice of Theme keys into the method of development of a text and that certain configurations of Theme serve to realise the function of each of the generic stages in each text.The description of each text begins with an examination of the generic stages. This is followed by an examination of the selection of Themes within each stage and how these collectively work to produce a particular method of development. The generic stages are then described logically in relation to each other and consideration is given to the distribution of given and new information and how these configurations also key into the method of development. The picture of each text as an instance of a particular genre is built up.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evaluation of corporate governance practise in Indonesia: a case study</field><field name="creator">Setiawan, Agus</field><field name="description">There is a limited published research on corporate governance practise in Asian countries, during and after the Asian economic crisis of 1997, especially the practise within the Indonesian context. Most of Indonesian companies suffered a loss during the crisis, and only a limited number of companies survived and booked a profit. This study is concerned with the corporate governance practice in a baby milk formula producer and a public listed company, PT Sari Husada Tbk. The company was acquired by Royal Numico N.V. Holland in 1997 and was one of those Indonesian companies which survived and outperformed the market average during the crisis. This research examined the elements of corporate governance system at Sari Husada and the role of each level of the firm, so that it could perform in the best interest of the company, using an ethnographic qualitative approach. Twenty one respondents from inside and outside the company have been interviewed, in order to find out evidences about what happened, how it happened and why it happened. Three cornerstones, corporate governance, corporate culture and strategic management, were used in analysing the data. The study found that the corporate governance practise in Sari Husada was partly adopted from the literature with some adjustments which included local culture and national interests. The company survived the crisis of 1997 because of the adoption of a multinational company's working system, the cultural change toward the attitude of productivity and efficiency, the products with an affordable price and quality nutrient, and the long and enduring effort of its managers and staff. Above all, Sari Husada has been able to transform into a new modern company which produces various related food products for babies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of reinforced concrete slabs subject to impact loading</field><field name="creator">Tahmasebinia, Faham</field><field name="description">Many older structures were designed for static loads but more recently there has been a growing awareness that some must be designed to resist both dynamic impact and static loads. An accidental impact load can be caused by mishaps in industry as well as accidents stemming from transportation or man-made disasters. Structural components can be subjected to a range of deliberate impact loads such as military activity or terrorist attacks. A large proportion of the surfaces of concrete structures are covered by reinforced concrete slabs. Slabs are often slender elements, which means they are vulnerable to flexural, shear, or a combination of both modes of failure when subjected to impact loading. There are a number of ways of predicting how an impact load will affect a concrete slab, some of which may be impractical or expensive but because there have been significant developments in technology, numerical techniques rather than experimental approaches have become popular methods for developing detailed responses. Furthermore, a numerical modelling for reinforced concrete slabs that are subjected to impact loads is a design concept that has not yet been realistically fully developed .Additionally, current codes are unable to suggest a clear and realistic approach. Nevertheless, a proven method for analysing and predicting possible failure mode is an essential requirement. Thus, the finite element package ABAQUS/Explicit as well as an experimental analyses was undertaken to examine the behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs subjected to impact loading.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Research and development of a new PET detector module</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Michael J</field><field name="description">A proposed new positron emission detector module was developed and researched with the aim to produce accurate depth of interaction information utilising high yield scintillators optically coupled to Si photodiode arrays with high end low noise readout electronics.

Three theories have different explanations of FDI flows; however, they all argue that FDI has an influence on the export performance of the host country. There are two positive influences of FDI on the host country's export performance. Firstly, MNCs subsidiaries exploit the host country's factor endowments for lower manufacturing cost to increase their exporting competitiveness. Therefore, the host country's export expansion by MNCs subsidiaries is expected. Secondly, the host country's exports can be increased by local firms through the spillover effect of FDI such as competition and transfer of knowledge. Significantly, there was an overall agreement that inward FDI had a positive effect on the host country's export performance. However, it is found that the results on this issue were inconclusive and require more evidence. The Taiwanese case was more relevant to this topic because Taiwan consistently encourages FDI, especially since the establishment of export processing zones for the purpose of export-oriented FDI from 1966. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the impacts of inward FDI on Taiwanese export performance from 1952 to 2005. The major hypothesis was that inward FDI has had a positive impact on Taiwanese export performance. To test this hypothesis, the sub-hypotheses were formed to arrive at a conclusion on the objective. The most recent unit root test in the presence of multiple structural breaks was examined by using the LP approach and the Granger causality model was adopted to enable research in a time series framework. Overall, support for the major hypothesis that inward FDI has had a positive effect on Taiwanese export performance has been obtained. Moreover, structural breaks in univariate time series coincide with not only the Taiwanese government's intervention on FDI policy and trade reforms but also the changes of the international political events and economic circumstances.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Almaviva: a contemporary adaptation of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Rachel</field><field name="description">Almaviva: A Contemporary Adaptation of Mozart&#8217;s Le Nozze di FigaroAlmaviva is a creative project, consisting of the text and score for a musical based on Mozart&#8217;s opera Le Nozze di Figaro as well as a supporting essay on the nature of adaptation.

The piece was first workshopped by students at the University of Wollongong in 2005, performing in a variety of vocal styles and with a very sparse set. Almaviva is designed for flexibility and for touring.The musical does not pre-suppose any prior exposure to opera or to the Figaro story. It aims for accessibility, and seeks to avoid operatic convention wherever possible. Almaviva is an experiment which seeks to radically transform the source while preserving some of its beauty. Almaviva is not a satire, but a free-standing work which uses the opera for scaffolding.This scaffolding includes the original score and Italian libretto, as well as the French play by Beaumarchais upon which the libretto is based. Almaviva is a third generation adaptation. The accompanying essay (Introduction) considers various aspects of adaptation, including authorship, translation, music setting and crossing genres. Central to this investigation are different ideas about fidelity to the source being adapted. For example, although Almaviva is a very free adaptation it seeks to recognise and preserve musical effect.The essay also considers the connection between adaptation and originality. Originality seems an odd quality in an adaptation, yet adaptations are frequently original, because immersion in a deeply creative work encourages creativity. Successful adaptation releases energy in two ways: For new audiences the adaptation works like any effective work of art, and the energy is derived from the successful expression of ideas. For audiences aware of the original work there is additional energy released by the re-contextualising of the familiar. The essay deliberately avoids assessing the effectiveness of Almaviva, but describes some of the major adaptations made to the Figaro story in all its incarnations paying particular attention to Almaviva.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery goals: goal quality, goal content and the impact of goal attainment on outcome for consumers with enduring mental illness</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Samantha</field><field name="description">Personal goals are an important foundation of recovery from enduring mental illness (EMI), providing a sense of meaning, identity and hope. Recovery goals, within a case-management setting, are developed in collaboration between the person in recovery from EMI and the mental health worker. Goals are a fundamental component of most rehabilitation programs and models of recovery emphasise the importance of the goal striving process, yet minimal research has examined goal setting and striving within the mental health case-management context. This thesis aimed to progress recovery research related to goal striving. Four studies are presented that examine aspects of recovery goal setting for consumers with EMI.Study 1 and 2 examined aspects of goal setting quality. Study 1 investigated the quality of goal setting within Australian mental health services. Mental health consumer files (N = 122) were reviewed and goal records were assessed for quality. Seventy four percent of files contained a goal record and on average goal records included 50% of goal setting principles likely to enhance goal progress. Goal setting quality was examined after mental health workers were trained in the Collaborative Recovery Model (CRM), which includes goal setting protocols drawn from previous evidence from goal research. Mental health consumers&#8217; goal records (N = 78) both prior to and subsequent to the Collaborative Recovery Training Program (CRTP) were also reviewed. CRTP lead to an improvement in both the frequency and quality of goal setting and the use of a structured goal setting intervention also seemed to promote further goal quality.To examine the relationship between goal quality and improvements in working alliance and treatment outcome, standardised residual gain scores for the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-s) and mental health outcome measures were calculated and correlated with goal quality for 110 mental health consumers. Goal quality was also associated with the goal and task subscales of the consumer rated WAI-s, and there was a modest relationship between goal quality and improvements in symptom distress.Study 2 also examined goal quality by surveying mental health workers (N = 83) on the clinical utility of the Collaborative Goal Technology (CGT) - a structured goal setting protocol. Workers reported they were more likely to use skills to develop meaningful and manageable goals when compared to the skills required to review goal progress. Technical skills of the CGT (calculating the Collaborative Goal Index and different levels of goal attainment) were employed least. Insufficient time was often reported as impeding correct use of the CGT and consumer factors (i.e., not being interested, too unstable) was the most frequently reported reason for mental health workers not attempting the CGT.Study 3 examined the content of case-management goals set within recovery and investigated whether the content of goals differed depending on the stage of psychological recovery. One hundred and forty four mental health consumers&#8217; CGT&#8217;s were reviewed. Physical health goals were reported significantly more frequently than any other types of goal and were rated as most important by 23% of consumers. Goals focused on employment and developing and maintaining relationships were often identified as most important, suggesting these types of goals are often a source of meaning and purpose for consumers within recovery. Significantly more health goals were set within the first stage of psychological recovery and health goals were also associated with poorer scores on the Recovery Assessment Scale - short. This suggests that in the early phases of recovery a focus on basic health needs is a priority and may signify the lack of longer term more meaningful goals at this time. Themes in the data suggest that people further along in their recovery set a greater range of goals. Relationship goals were typically set within the middle stages of recovery followed by employment goals toward the later stages of recovery. There was also significantly more approach goals set within the last two stages of recovery indicating that within these final stages, goals are more likely to be focused on moving towards desirable outcomes rather than avoiding negative outcomes.Study 4 explored the relationship between case-management goal attainment and improvements in mental health outcome (N = 71). Path modelling indicated that when symptoms are perceived as less distressing consumers are better able to make progress towards their case-management goals, which in turn promotes aspects of recovery such as; hope, self-confidence, sense of purpose and positive identity. This highlights the importance of a recovery framework of casemanagement, placing a focus on both alleviation of symptoms and promoting striving towards personally meaningful goals in order to promote recovery from EMI.The present research provides insight into the quality and content of goals set within recovery from mental illness for consumers with EMI and also provides support that goal attainment is associated with enhanced psychological recovery. Longitudinal research is required to assess the direction of the relationships found between treatment outcome and goal quality and goal attainment and, goal content and psychological recovery.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facial expression recognition for multi-player on-line games</field><field name="creator">Zhan, Ce</field><field name="description">Multi-player on-line games (MOGs) have become increasingly popular because of the opportunity they provide for collaboration, communications and interactions. However, compared with ordinary human communication, MOG still has several limitations, especially in the communication using facial expressions. Although detailed facial animation has already been achieved in a number of MOGs, players have to use text commands to control the expressions of avatars. This thesis proposes an automatic expression recognition system that can be integrated into a MOG to control the facial expressions of avatars. To meet the specific requirements of such a system, a number of algorithms are studied, tailored and extended. In particular, Viola-Jones face detection method is modified in several aspects to detect small scale key facial components with wide shape variations. In addition a new coarse-to-fine method is proposed for extracting 20 facial landmarks from image sequences. The proposed system has been evaluated on a number of databases that are different from the training database and achieved 83% recognition rate for 4 emotional state expressions. During the real-time test, the system achieved an average frame rate of 13 fps for 320 x 240 images on a PC with 2.80 GHz Intel Pentium. Testing results have shown that the system has a practical range of working distances (from user to camera), and is robust against variations in lighting and backgrounds.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of GIS techniques for automated topographic and hydrologic analysis</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Chris J</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a research project which focuses on improving the accuracy, and extending the capabilities of topographic and hydrologic analysis algorithms. These algorithms can be applied within GIS frameworks for parameterisations of hydrologic models. In this research project, several new algorithms were developed to overcome the observed deficiencies in current algorithms for GIS based analysis of raster Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). These algorithms were used to develop a software product CatchmentSIM which has been made freely available to researchers and practitioners. CatchmentSIM allows for interpolation of a DEM from contour and streamline data, removal of flat and pit cells, catchment delineation, automated catchment break-up, analysis of impervious areas, modelling of urban catchments, and the hydrologic and geomorphologic analysis of subcatchment properties. Following the application of CatchmentSIM to a DEM, a simple internal macro language can be used to automatically create files in any binary or text file format. This allows coupling with a full range of Australian and international hydrologic models, including RAFTS-XP, WBNM, RORB, URBS, DRAINS and HEC-HMS. The algorithims developed during this research were verified by comparative analysis against current approaches, as well as verification in two case studies. CatchmentSIM enables users to build on the increasingly comprehensive information available in todays GIS world, while avoiding the traditional shortcomings of conventional raster GIS techniques, and maintaining tight coupling with existing industry standard modelling approaches.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing of continuous queries over infinite data streams</field><field name="creator">Vossough, Ehsan</field><field name="description">Processing of continuous data streams is emerging as a new and expanding area of research and concerns the processing of information from sources that produce data in a fast rate and in a continuous way. For example, information from sensory devices can be considered as a continuously expanding and unlimited sequence of data items without any boundaries. Traditionally, such information required special monitoring applications and equipment that process and react to continual inputs from several sources such as in a weather monitoring station, patient monitoring equipment, etc. This thesis concerns the use of an off the shelf DBMS for the processing of fast evolving data streams in relational database management systems. It investigates the utilization of existing features in a DBMS and their adoption to process infinite data streams and discusses the performance of the proposed solution. It provides a solution to the inherent limitations in the architecture of a DBMS to be able to react to continual inputs from several sources. The outcome of this thesis shows that it is possible to process continuous data streams from several sources and in some ways a better performance was also achievable.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On an approach to provide space diversity to an ultra wideband time hopping pulse position modulated wireless communication system</field><field name="creator">Vial, Peter James</field><field name="description">The hypothesis question, which is addressed in this PhD dissertation, is how to use two transmission antennas in an Ultra Wide Band Time Hopping Pulse Position Modulation system to take advantage of space diversity in such a way as to not significantly degrade the communication link compared to using only one transmit antenna. In answering the hypothesis question, this dissertation proposes a novel technique, based on Space Time Spreading, to allow an Ultra Wideband Time Hopping Pulse Position Modulation system to obtain full advantage from space diversity using two transmit antennas and one receive antenna, showing how such a Multiple Input Multiple Output system is designed. This is achieved with the added advantage of transmitting the same two symbols simultaneously on each antenna link. This means that for the proposed system, should a fade occur on one of the two antenna links, the two symbols transmitted will still be received with a slight increased cost in average Bit Error Rate (BER) performance as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) or measured Eb/No is increased.Results are first provided for wideband Space Time Spreading in the presence of Multiple Access Interference when using two, four and eight transmit antennas. A system is developed in simulation using modules provided by MATLABs Simulink program. It is then shown that using low correlation Wysocki spreading code set results in an improved BER performance compared to the more often used Walsh Hadamard spreading code set. A Simulink Ultra Wide Band Pulse Position Modulation Single Input Single Output system is developed and validated against published peer reviewed material. This is then modified to consider the use of Space Time Spreading in a Single Input Single Output system and it is shown that improved performance over an Ultra Wide Band Pulse Position Modulated Single Input Single Output is possible. It is also shown that this improvement allows the transmission of two symbols in the same time that the original system only transmits one symbol.The thesis also investigates a system which uses two transmit antennas but a hard decision is made on a chip by chip basis. Its performance, compared to an equivalent Single Input Single Output comparable system, is suboptimal. It does, however, have the advantage that it sends two symbols in the same time that the equivalent Single Input Single output Ultra Wide Band Pulse Position Modulation system sends one, and its implementation is simpler to codify. Also, it has the feature that both symbols are sent simultaneously on each antenna link.The simulator is then modified to make a hard decision after all chips of a spreading sequence for two antennas are received and it is shown that this system, in simulation and analysis, has a similar performance to that for a comparable Single Input Single Output system with the added advantage that both antenna links send the same two symbols simultaneously. It is further demonstrated in simulation and analysis that such systems can be affected by Multiple Access Interference. In addition, it is shown, using simulation, that the choice of spreading sequence set does have an impact on the average BER performance of the proposed Space Time Spreading Time Hopping Ultra Wideband Pulse Position Modulation system. The thesis finally proposes some extensions using the developed simulator which are outlined in future work.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mudrooroo: a likely story, identity and belonging in postcolonial Australia</field><field name="creator">Clark, Maureen</field><field name="description">In this study, postcolonial, postmodern and feminist critical theories are used as analytical tools to examine the life and work of black Australian author and long-time advocate of Aboriginal rights, Colin Johnson/Mudrooroo Nyoongah. The project acknowledges the broad scope and vigour of the authors literary production, but concentrates on his ten works of fiction. Readings of the novels proceed on the basis that the meaning of who Johnson is and what he once represented has changed. In the years leading up to the new millennium, the legitimacy of the authors claim to Aboriginality was publicly questioned. As a consequence, neither he nor his artistic product can be seen to inhere to the pre-existing discourses of identity that left his Aboriginal status unchallenged. Until now, there has been no sustained analysis of the authors novels following the 1996 refutation of his claim to belonging to the Nyoongar people of Western Australia, through a matrilineal link. This study seeks to fill that gap. It differs markedly from previous examinations of Johnsons oeuvre and asks where the man and his work now belong in Australias literary history. Against popular literary theory, one of the aims of this study is to show how Johnson and his texts are inextricably, if imaginatively, intertwined to such a measure that, at times, fiction and fact become almost inseparable. Whatever form it may take, literature does not exist in an independent domain or in some autonomous artistic universe outside society. It is argued here that the range of possibilities of meaning to be found in the authors novels emerges, to a large extent, from the complexities of his own life &#65533; from the drama of the personal and social worlds beyond his texts. The temptation to equate the alleged fiction of the authors life with what he writes does not dismiss his accomplishments, however. The significance of his admirable contribution to Australian contemporary literature is undeniable. Rather, it is argued here that this new scenario offers the potential to open up a further range of readings and invites a different critical approach to Johnsons backward looking, yet visionary writings. Underlying the notion that a shift in critical commentary is called for, is the reality of Johnsons institutionalisation as a child and the trauma of separation from his mother and siblings this likely entailed. Given the autobiographical nature of much of Johnsons fiction, the possibility that his mother was white, not black as he consistently claimed &#65533; and has neither confirmed nor denied &#65533; is crucial to any serious contemporary analysis of his work. The prospect that, for whatever reason, the author has consistently misrepresented his mother is also critical to any explanation for the ever-increasing level of misogyny he articulates in the course of his literary trajectory. Discussion develops in the context of Johnsons writing as his means of giving expression to a sense of loss and betrayal engendered by the mother figure and manifested in a symbolic alignment with the female as the source of the worlds ills. It also turns on Johnsons recent claims that the conditions that made his career as an Aboriginal author possible were governed primarily by the colour of his skin as the marker of identity in a priori discourses of race in Australian society. In other words, his appearance was a contributing factor to any personal complicity in what he claims was the textualisation of his identity by his mentor, the late Dame Mary Durack in unequal black/white relations of power. The project concludes by suggesting that Johnsons lasting message is that the colonial-will-to-dominate remains unchanged. It also proposes that the authors silence regarding his mothers real identity and thus his own, may be read as an act of rebellion &#65533; a refusal to bow to the sceptre of subordinating white power and ideology that is similarly reflected in his anti-authoritarian writing.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Textual intimacy: ethical education for characters and readers in Jane Austen's novels</field><field name="creator">Lebow, Lori Karen</field><field name="description">This project examines four of Jane Austen's novels, focusing on narrative technique that positions readers to experience ethical dilemmas similar to those which serve to educate the heroines. Jane Austen's texts explore the epistemological issues of how subjectivity and imagination distort perception. Of particular importance is the communication process. Attention to language in all of its forms suggests Austen's acute awareness of the linguistic nature of human experience. Because Austen valued honesty and integrity, her texts demonstrate the necessity of cultivating these qualities to achieve enriching, intimate relationships. Language becomes the means through which characters are able to evaluate each other and to discover 'truth'. While the characters in the novels gain understanding, readers are similarly instructed because the narrative positions readers to become intimates of the characters. Since novels selectively create a textual reality, they become examples of the problems they raise. Characters and readers are taught to value compassion, and to maintain a generous, open-minded attitude in relating to each other. Narrative technique and reader response in Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma and Persuasion, indicate that as Austen's skill developed, her narrative manipulations of reader response gained subtlety. While readers may be aware of the education process occurring within the text, Austen's creation of a mirroring experience for readers may be overlooked.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the synthesis, characterization and properties of colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) materials</field><field name="creator">Gao, Feng</field><field name="description">Metal oxides constitute an interesting class of materials with a wide range of properties. They exhibit a variety of phenomena such as ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. In the last few years, a new aspect of the metal oxides has come to the fore. This is colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) exhibited by certain manganese oxides, in particular rare earth manganites of perovskite structure. Due to their CMR, there have been many investigations on perovskite manganese oxides, especially A(subscript 1-x)B(subscript x)MnO(subscript 3) (where A is a lanthanum series element and B is a divalent element such as Sr or Ca) compound. These recent investigations, both theoretical and experimental, contribute to an improved understanding of the fundamental science of these materials. This project was aimed at studying this novel material. Samples were produced by bulk materials synthesis using the solid state reaction method and by thin film growth using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. We have carried out X-ray diffraction measurements and electrical-magnetic transport measurements to determine the crystal structure and resistivity of CMR samples of different doping. The structural properties, transport properties, and magnetic properties in different samples have been observed and analyzed. In spite of many interesting physical phenomena discovered in recent years, optical properties of ABMnO(subscript 3) compounds have not been investigated in detail. Far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopy is sensitive to lattice vibration modes and so is an appropriate probe of CMR materials, in which the lattice vibration plays an important role. By using FIR techniques, the materials phonon vibration modes have been determined and analyzed for all the samples studied. The major results from the PhD study are: (1) CsI as a carrier (or matrix) is for the first time used for CMR materials in the FIR transmission experiment. The CsI transmission range is wilder than the traditional carrier KBr, and the FIR transmission data area similar to reflection data while only needing little material. The FIR results on different materials samples prepared by using CsI have been published in five papers. (2) La(subscript 1-x)Ca(subscript x)Mn(subscript 09)Li(subscript 0.1)O(subscript 3) compounds, when 10% Li ions are doped on the Mn site, are of orthorhombic structure with lattice parameters that decrease with increasing Ca concentration. The FIR spectra indicate the Li ions occupy the Mn site - while the Li ion is too light to be detected by EDS. (3) The FIR transmission spectra of A(Co(subscript 05)Mn(subscript 05)O(subscript 3) [or (A(subscript 2)CoMnO(subscript 6)] (A = La, Nd, Dy, Ho, Yb) revealed the phonon modes systematic shift and split and the appearance of new modes as the mass of the lanthanide elements increases. The data suggests a strong correlation between the phonon modes and the magnetic properties of these compounds, most likely through the electron-phonon interaction. Also the spin glass state was observed in these materials. (4) The surface and interface of La(subscript 0.7)Ca(subscript 0.3)MnO(subscript 3) thin film on MgO substrate were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and secondary ions mass spectroscopy (SIMS). By comparing study thin film and the bulk target, it was found: (i) The transition temperature (T(subscript MI)) is around 150 K for thin film, about 100 K lower than the target. We explain that from theory of weak localization and additional carrier scattering caused from possible diffusion. (ii) The resistivity of the thin film decreases much faster in the insulating regime because the activation energy is smaller than in the target, assuming the carrier transport in the insulating regime is of the activation type. (iii) From the FIR refection spectra of thin film, a new surface mode was observed. [Note: this abstract contained scientific formulae that would not come across on this form.

This involves the identification of the criteria for an effective OHS. The research questions are what content, structure, functions and aesthetics this OHS should have. The research will also provide guidelines about how to evaluate the usability of an OHS. To learn unfamiliar features or functions of a Nursing Information System (NIS), nurses need effective and efficient assistances. An OHS, which aims to bridge the gap between the complexity of a NIS and nurse-users&#8217; need for simplicity, is one effective solution. However, systematic research on the design and evaluation of an OHS is not common. There is a lack of a comprehensive quality framework that could provide guidance on the design and evaluation of an OHS for a NIS. As nurses are important healthcare workers, their acceptance and usage of a NIS is important for the improvement of quality of healthcare data, it is imperative to conduct this research with strong potential to impact on the adoption of NIS by nurses. Research Methodology: Two phases of investigation were carried out. Guided by a grounded theory approach, we first proposed a quality framework of an effective OHS for a NIS. In order to prove the validity of this framework, an experiment was carried out in which an OHS for an authentic NIS (the Care Planning and Assessment Tool) was developed and evaluated. Various research methods were employed in collecting data, i.e. laboratory-based usability testing, focus group discussion and questionnaire survey. Results: The proposed framework was consisted of the five criteria (i.e. content, structure, functionality, aesthetics, and usability. The CPAT Online Help was designed according to the results of the needs assessment and the forty-three guidelines that reflect the quality indicators in the framework. The results of the heuristic evaluation of the CPAT Online Help shows that the help system highly reflect on the proposed framework. The results of the usability testing suggest that the usability of both online help and hard-copy help manual is similar (i.e. no significant group difference was found for the results of both laboratory testing and the answers to the user satisfactory survey between online help and hard-copy help manual). However, in the laboratory experiment, the overall performances of the participants who used the CPAT Online Help were obviously better than those of the participants who used the hardcopy user manual. In addition, the survey responses from the former were more positive than those from the latter. Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed quality framework and their indicators were validated and supported by our research results and findings. Our research suggested that 1) nurse users&#8217; basic computer skills, knowledge about an NIS, knowledge about procedures of nursing documentation should be covered in an OHS; 2) function-oriented and task-oriented structure are the effective structures of an OHS; 3) table of contents, frequently ask questions, search engine and video demonstration are effective functions; 4) visual-effectiveness can facilitate a nurse-user&#8217;s problem solving 5) the indicators of the usability of an OHS is the 5Es: effectiveness, efficiency, error-tolerance, engaging and ease of learning.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/9</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time operating system in Java</field><field name="creator">Lu, Qinghua</field><field name="description">Real-time operating systems (RTOSes) are required to run for years, and never fail, without human intervention. Safety is the primary concern for RTOSes because they usually control physical equipment. One strand of real-time operating system (RTOS) research is looking at the question: can developing an RTOS in a safe language result in a system that an errant process can&#8217;t crash?  Choosing a good programming language can significantly improve the safety of the RTOS.  In this thesis, we examine the advantages and associated problems of writing RTOSes in a safe language, namely Java.  We design an RTOS named JARTOS that schedules processes on a micro-controller called TINI. The code of the JARTOS system is mainly written in Java, since Java provides both static and dynamic safety. The Java compiler handles potentially unsafe operations rather than the programmer.  Also, Java includes run-time support to catch and handle run-time errors.JARTOS is designed to be a time-sharing system, where cooperative multiprocessing is used to schedule real-time processes. JARTOS switches processes on a timer interrupt. Each process is required to execute quickly and then give up the processor. Otherwise it will be timed out. To implement a timeout, JARTOS supports a timer interrupt that regularly updates a clock and checks for timeouts. To keep the number of interrupts to a minimum, input/output is done using polling where possible.  Also, interrupts code is designed to be transparent to the processes. An interrupt handler sets flags and values, and then returns to the process it interrupted.In the context of achieving real-time performance, we look at the issues of implementing our system design in Java. We introduce how we used Java constructs to implement the design of JARTOS, and how we solved the low-level issues. RTOSes have to guarantee that real-time processes execute within specified time dead-lines. Loss of synchronization can occur when deadlines are not met. Timing problems are often very difficult to find. In JARTOS, we designed a set of performance measurements to investigate timing problems. These performance measurements are carefully designed to provide the right information at minimal cost in performance. Performance of TINI and JARTOS are measured and discussed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the performance of optical feedback self-mixing interferometry for vibration measurement</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yi</field><field name="description">Optical feedback self-mixing interferometer (OFSMI) is an optoelectronic system that makes use of the self-mixing interferometric effect of semiconductor lasers (SLs). When a small portion of the light emitted by a laser diode (LD) is reflected or back scattered by an external object and re-enter the laser cavity, the reflected light will interfere with the light inside the cavity which causing the variance of the overall laser intensity emitted by the LD. During the past decades, this physical phenomenon has been studied extensively and many possible applications have been investigated. A major application is the measurement of metrological quantities associated with the external object, including the displacement, the speed, the vibration parameters, and so on. A well known conclusion regarding the OFSMI based measurement is that the accuracy or resolution is limited by   with the simple OFSMI setup with constant driving current for the LD and without adding other extra optic components. This thesis aims to report on the research work which tries to improve the performance in terms of accuracy of OFSMI systems. In particular, novel techniques are demonstrated that enable simple OFSMI systems to higher accuracy beyond the limitation   for displacement measurement. Also new techniques for measuring the linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) and feedback level factor (C) of the LD are developed. In order to achieve these target, various novel techniques have been proposed and implemented, including the data-fitting principle for displacement estimation, genetic algorithms for estimating multiple parameters of OFSMI systems, phase-unwrapping algorithm for OFSMI signals and data preparation methods.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding biology of Gould's petrels pterodroma leucoptera: predicting breeding outcomes from a physiological and morphological appraisal of adults</field><field name="creator">O'Dwyer, Terence W</field><field name="description">1) The breeding biology of Goulds petrels Pterodroma leucoptera was studied at Cabbage Tree Island, New South Wales over three successive breeding seasons from 2000/01. I sought to identify better reproductively performing individuals and to identify indicators of breeding success through a physiological and morphological appraisal of adult characteristics. 2) Goulds petrels exhibit no sex linked plumage dimorphism, however, knowledge of the sex of both adults and chicks was an integral component of this study. Blood samples were taken from 209 adults and 206 chicks and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular technique was used to determine their sex. With the knowledge of the sex of individuals a discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on several skeletal measures was developed. The DFA could predict the sex of adults with an accuracy of about 85% and chicks with an accuracy of 66%. 3) Relationships between egg laying characteristics and hatching success were assessed. Egg laying occurred over a four week period from early November to early December. Egg volumes ranged from 30-42 ml and averaged approximately 37 ml in both years. Hatching success was 76% (78 of 102) and 65% (60 of 93) in 2001/02 and 2002/03 respectively. Incubation periods ranged from 42 to 64 days with an average of approximately 49 days. There were no significant relationships between either laying date and hatching success or egg volume and hatching success. There was, however, significant interyear repeatability in individual laying dates and in egg volumes, and egg volume significantly influenced hatchling mass and size. 4) The influences of circulating levels of prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (T) on hatching success were examined. Throughout incubation females tended to have higher levels of PRL than males. After the onset of incubation, PRL concentration increased significantly from pre-laying levels of 2.7 &#65533; 0.6 ng/ml in males and 3.1 &#65533; 0.6 in females to 26.3 &#65533; 0.7 ng/ml and 28.8 &#65533; 0.5 ng/ml, respectively. PRL levels were significantly higher in breeding pairs that successfully hatched an egg compared to those whose egg failed to hatch. The pattern of male T secretion was typical for a species with high levels of male parental care and low male-male aggression, with T levels decreasing after the onset of incubation and then remaining relatively low up to chick fledging. Although not statistically significant, failed breeders had a tendency to have higher T levels than successful breeders. 5) Adult body condition and blood haemoglobin levels were measured throughout the breeding cycle. A body condition index (BCI) was calculated for each individual based on its body mass relative to structural size. The influence of BCI on hatching success was examined and interyear repeatability in BCI was assessed. There was no relationship between parental condition and egg hatchability. There was, however, a significant positive relationship between female body condition and egg volume and between male body condition and PRL level. There was also significant interyear repeatability in the body condition of both males and females. 6) Interannual variation in feeding frequencies and meal sizes were determined and the influence of parental body condition on provisioning rates was investigated. Mean meal sizes varied significantly between years, which suggest there are variations in food availability within Goulds petrels foraging range. On average, foraging trips averaged approximately three days and chicks were fed every second day. Parents that went on longer foraging trips provided larger meals to their chicks. However, parents that went on shorter trips provided more food per day spent foraging, which suggests they were more effective foragers. Moreover, in 2001/02 when meal sizes suggest food was less abundant, parents that were in better body condition during incubation were the more efficient foragers. These results suggest that parental condition has an important influence on chick provisioning rates, especially when environmental conditions are suboptimal. 7) Interannual variations in chick growth and nestling blood haemoglobin accumulation were examined in relation to parental body condition. Chick mass and skeletal growth rate varied significantly between years. The mean age of fledglings was 90 &#65533; 1 days in both years and fledging mass was 175 &#65533; 2 g and 177 &#65533; 2 g in 2001/02 and 2002/03, respectively. There was a significant positive relationship between the body condition of parents and the body condition of chicks at their peak mass (BCI(subscript pm)) of their chick. Parental body condition also influenced chick growth rate (g/day) and was inversely related to fledging age of the chick. There were significant positive interyear correlations between the body condition of chicks from the same parents. Also, if parents produced a good quality chick in 2001/02 they were in relatively good body condition during incubation in 2002/03. Furthermore, these parents went on to again produce a good quality chick in 2002/03. These results suggest that good parental body condition is important for reproductive success and that certain parents are consistently able to acquire more resources that can be allocated to both self-maintenance and reproduction and are, consequently, better reproductive performers.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of granular filters and constriction-based filter design criteria</field><field name="creator">Raut, Ashok K</field><field name="description">In geotechnical engineering, a filter is designed to protect soils, called base, within or behind a structure from erosion due to seepage. As water flows through the soil, fine particles can be washed out, leading to internal erosion and eventually, the failure of the structure. A correctly designed filter retains loose soil particles, thus preventing erosion. In contrast, it allows unobstructed seepage, preventing build-up of detrimental pore pressure. A filter is commonly a natural or manufactured sand and gravel. Filters are used in dams, agricultural drainage, road pavements, retaining walls, canal linings, coastal protection, landfills and so on. First time in early 1920s, Terzaghi suggested two filter design criteria through laboratory investigations on uniform sands. These criteria involved ratios of some specific sizes of filter and base materials. Most subsequent studies ended up either merely investigating validity of or extending these criteria to other soil types. Current professional guidelines are still empirical and based on particle sizes. However, within filters, it is pores (i.e. constrictions) that govern filtration. Consequently, these particle-based guidelines exhibit some serious limitations. In this thesis, limitations of current professional guidelines are comprehensively discussed. A detailed mathematical procedure is developed to determine constriction sizes, and subsequently, constriction-based criteria are proposed to describe filter effectiveness in various types of soils. The proposed criteria are verified using several large-scale tests carried out at the University of Wollongong including several test data available in the literature. Finally, an enhanced filter design guideline is suggested for the professional practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and functional characterisation of the extracellular chaperone clusterin</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Elise M</field><field name="description">The incidence of protein conformational disorders is a problem affecting the aging population and is an increasing cost on the health system. These diseases involve the breakdown of control mechanisms within and outside of cells leading to accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. The control of protein folding, both inside and outside the cell, is important to maintain the integrity of all proteins. Dysfunctions in this control may lead to the development of protein conformational disorders. Intracellularly the mechanisms monitoring the correct translation, modification, assembly and transport of synthesised proteins are very well studied. However, in the harsh extracellular environment, mechanisms to control protein folding need further investigation. Extracellular chaperones have recently been proposed as an important part of extracellular quality control for protein folding. The ubiquitous glycoprotein clusterin has been implicated in this extracellular quality control mechanism. A primary aim of the work described in this thesis was to examine the relationship between clusterin structure and function. This was done using three different approaches; characterisation of mutant clusterin expressed in transfected CHO cells; characterisation of enzymatically deglycosylated clusterin; and characterisation of bacterially expressed recombinant clusterin domains. Initially a panel of mutants was designed to disrupt predicted features of the protein, consisting of five point mutants and five truncation mutants. The clusterin molecules were expressed in CHO cells and were proteolytically processed with two subunits and appeared to be normally glycosylated. The mutant clusterin molecules appeared to be chaperone-active to some degree also, evidenced by their copurification with non- specific media proteins. In a rolling culture proteins in the media would be exposed to sheer stress and one of the actions of clusterin is to bind to exposed hydrophobicity on stressed proteins. A decrease in the amount of contaminating proteins copurified with clusterin when static cultures were used instead of rolling cultures supports this argument. In an effort to understand the importance of the glyscosylation of clusterin, the conjugated sugars were enzymatically removed to determine their effects on clusterin function. The success of the deglycosylation process was first verified using SDSPAGE and mass spectrometry. Structural features of the deglycosylated molecule were tested, with no change seen in the secondary structure of the deglycosylated protein compared to the native protein. A shift to slightly acidic pH produced no change in secondary structure as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Exposed hydrophobicity was seen to increase with the removal of the sugars but the Kd of the interaction with bisANS was not significantly different. At slightly acidic pH both the wild type and deglycosylated molecules exposed a greater amount of hydrophobicity to solution. Binding to the known clusterin ligand megalin was also tested with a similar binding affinity seen for both molecules, however the removal of sugars increased the rate at which the molecule bound to and dissociated from megalin. Binding of the deglycosylated molecule to known native ligands (IgG and GST) and stressed protein ligands (lysozyme and BSA) was not affected by the absence of sugar moieties. The chaperone activity of the deglycosylated molecule was also not different to the wild type molecule. Following the determination that the sugars appeared to have little effect on the activity of clusterin, a series of domains was cloned into bacterial expression vectors. Two domains (&#945;N: D23-E112 and &#946;C: R306-E449) were purified and their structure and function was examined. In the presence of a polar solvent both domains exhibited alpha helical secondary structure as expected based on amino acid analysis, though in aqueous buffer the domains had very little or no significant structure. The domains alone did not have any effect on the heat stressed precipitation of citrate synthase. Neither domain alone bound to heat-stressed lysozyme, however the &#945;N domain bound to the native protein ligand IgG and this was enhanced at slightly acidic pH, as seen with native clusterin. The &#945;N domain also bound with high affinity to LRP indicating that this domain of clusterin is likely to be involved in binding interactions of the entire molecule. Interaction between the &#945;N and &#946;C domains was also observed and further investigation is required to determine binding and chaperone activity of the interacting domains. Understanding the functional relationship between the structure and function of clusterin is important in understanding the role of clusterin in protein folding control. This knowledge may also be important in the development of novel treatments for the prevention or slowing of protein conformational diseases. The work in this manuscript showed that the deglycosylated form of clusterin is as potent a chaperone as the entire clusterin molecule. This indicated that a bacterially expressed form of clusterin may be used to further investigate the function of the molecule. Recombinant domains of clusterin were also studied to localise the regions of the molecule important in clusterin binding and chaperone function. Further investigation is needed, however the use of bacterially expressed recombinant proteins allows the potential development of recombinant chaperone-active clusterin which may ultimately be used as a therapeutic for protein conformational diseases. This research has gone some way to showing the best methods of characterising the structural relevance to the binding and chaperone activity of clusterin, and to providing a knowledge base for future investigations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the modelling of the distributional properties of financial time series - An application of dynamic models within the context of conditional variance of basis risk</field><field name="creator">Biondini, Riccardo</field><field name="description">The thesis investigates the problems involved in effectively modelling the (time-varying basis risk (the risk of large movements in the relationship between the spot price and the derivatives price) and the subsequent calculation of effective hedge ratios. The specific purpose of this research involves the identification of conditional variance models that accommodate the time series properties commonly encountered in many spot and futures return series, by targeting changes in basis volatility over time. The research analyses the problem of incorporating conditional basis variance into the time series model by extending popular specifications to include long-run (cointegration) information. The analysis investigates whether the omission of cointegration information in the underlying econometric time series model leads to inappropriate modelling of long-run and short-run time series behaviour. Cointegration information, through the squared spread between spot and futures rates, may potentially provide predictive power in modelling volatility of asset returns, volatility that is not captured effectively by GARCH (1,1) model. Consequences of omitting dynamic adjustments include inadequate modelling of the time series behaviour, sub-optimal decision making and the possible progressive degeneration of such modelling and decision making over time. The research determines hedging criteria that enables the comparison of the effectiveness of different constant hedge ratios. The comparison of conditional variance measures of various hedge ratios is of interest to the hedger who would like to implement a constant hedge but does not wish to be constrained to choosing either the na&#65533;ve or minimum-variance hedge. An alternative constant hedge ratio to the na&#65533;ve and minimum-variance hedges, termed the forecasted hedge, is proposed. The forecasted hedge ratio is based upon the forecasting curves of both the conditional covariance between spot and figures returns and the conditional variance of futures returns, extracting information embedded in the time-varying distribution of spot and futures returns. Dynamic hedges are compared to constant procedures to determine the conditions under which allowance for conditional variance substantially increases hedging effectiveness. Hedging effectiveness is subsequently defined as the percentage reduction in the variance of the portfolio achieved by implementing a hedged rather than and unhedged position. Where dynamic variance-covariance matrices are effectively modelled, hedge ratios may be constructed that subsequently minimise basis risk. Another major objective of the research involves the determination of the conditions where periodic re-balancing of the optimal hedge ratio leads to increased hedging effectiveness. The analysis determines criteria that must be triggered in order for an alternative hedging strategy to be better (in terms of risk-reduction) than the strategy currently in effect. The most important contribution of the thesis is to ensure that in time series modelling of financial series, the basic model adopted is capable of accounting for any significant short-run and long-run characteristics found to be typical of these series. Concentration is focussed on the calculation of optimal hedge ratios in order to simplify that analysis, by using a very common example of the conditional variance situation. However, the fundamental contribution involves attempting to ensure the basic econometric specification is appropriate in modelling typical time series behaviour so it does not need further adjustment.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and function studies of recombinant clusterin</field><field name="creator">Gonzalez Cendales, Yvonne T</field><field name="description">Clusterin is a ubiquitous secreted glycoprotein that acts as an extracellular chaperone. It effectively inhibits stress-induced protein aggregation by an ATP independent mechanism, binding to partially unfolded proteins and forming soluble high molecular weight complexes with them (Wilson and Easterbrook-Smith, 2000).  A model proposed by Yerbury et al. (2005) suggested that if clusterin mediates the clearance and degradation of misfolded extracellular proteins in vivo and this action is anti-inflammatory, a recombinant form of clusterin might be therapeutically useful to clear protein debris from sites of disease and inflammation and in this way suppress pathology. The expression of recombinant mammalian proteins is often performed using mammalian or insect cells because some post-translational processes (glycosylation, phosphorylation, oligomerization, specific protein cleavage and disulfide bond formation) are not performed by bacterial cells (Sambrook et al., 1989). However, since Stewart et al. (2007) showed that clusterin retains its chaperone function when deglycosylated and that deglycosylation did not induce major structural changes in the molecule, the possibility of producing chaperone-active human clusterin in bacteria became apparent. This thesis describes an attempt to produce a chaperone-active recombinant clusterin expressed in bacteria to provide a large scale supply of protein useful in therapeutic applications. In addition, two different commercially available recombinant clusterin proteins were compared in structure and chaperone function with human serum clusterin to provide additional insights into any functional limitations of recombinantly expressed clusterin proteins and to supply the information to the manufacturer. Firstly, the expression of clusterin - MBP fusion protein was attempted in E. coli TBI but full length recombinant clusterin - MBP fusion protein was only detected as a minor species; a large part of the product  was cleaved from MBP during expression and most of the MBP-clusterin fusion protein was degraded with time. Thus, because it was not possible to obtain a source of stable clusterin - MBP fusion protein, the expression of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein was attempted. Gateway&#174; cloning technology was used for cloning and expressing clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein in E. coli. After expression, the protein was extracted and purified under denaturing conditions. The purified protein was subsequently refolded in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% azide, alkylated with 50 mM IAA and dialyzed prior to developing functional and structural analyses. After expression in E. coli TBI, clusterin &#8211; 6xHis Tag fusion protein was detected along with disulfide-bonded high molecular weight aggregates and putative truncated products. While structural studies by CD revealed that the predicted secondary structure content of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein and plasma-derived clusterin were similar, functional analysis revealed that the former had little if any chaperone activity (its limited effects on the heat-induced precipitation of fibrinogen were not dose-dependent). Structural (SEC, CD) and functional analyses (chaperone assays and IgG binding test) of Flag-Tagged full-length recombinant human clusterin (expressed in human embryonic kidney cells) and His-Tagged partial-length recombinant rat clusterin (expressed in E. coli, not post translationally processed, thus not cleaved into &#61537; and &#946; chains and not glycosilated) (both commercial proteins from BioVendor- Laboratory Medicine, Inc.) indicated that the recombinant proteins tested had (i) an increased proportion of high molecular weight species when compared with plasma-derived clusterin, (ii) predicted secondary structure content similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin, (iii) chaperone activity but were less effective than plasma-derived clusterin (recombinant human 28%, recombinant rat 48% less effective) and (iv) were able to bind IgG, the IgG binding activity was dose-dependent and similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin. Furthermore, the results obtained for recombinant rat clusterin suggested that the expression of chaperone active clusterin in bacteria is possible and that cleavage into &#61537; and &#946; chains and the C-terminus of the beta chain (residues 22-145) are not required for chaperone or IgG binding activity. Further studies will be required to optimize production of a chaperone active form of human clusterin in bacteria.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of nutrient variability and the consequences for benthic communities on the Coral Coast fringing reefs, Fiji</field><field name="creator">Tamata, Ulukalesi B</field><field name="description">The Coral Coast region, in south-western Viti Levu, Fiji, is the &#8216;hub&#8217; of tourism development in Fiji, and is one of the fastest developing areas in Fiji. Since the 1980s, development along the Coral Coast has occurred at a rate never previously seen in this area. Large resorts and smaller backpacker facilities emerged from the once coconut-tree lined coastal stretch, from Serua, to Natadola. Village populations have also increased. Anecdotal information and the few, sporadic studies conducted in this area have indicated that the water quality and the biological communities on the fringing reefs have deteriorated dramatically since the 1980s. Live corals which used to feature prominently on the fringing reefs (hence the name &#8216;Coral Coast), have been replaced by weedy macroalgae, the most common of which is the brown algae Sargassum. The Coral Coast fringing reefs were apparently undergoing phase shifts (like other reefs around the world), and anthropogenic factors have been blamed. The need for scientific information on the effects of anthropogenic activities on the Coral Coast water quality and fringing reef communities prompted this study. The study had several objectives. Two major components addressed the need to establish baseline scientific information on the variability of dissolved nutrients in the water column, and the status of biological communities on the reef flats of the fringing reefs, for control sites (away from human impacts), and impacted sites (close to villages and resorts).  Nutrients from anthropogenic sources on land have been identified as one the major bottom-up controlling factors for phase shifts on coral reefs. Control, village and resort sites were monitored for nutrient concentrations from 2003 &#8211; 2006, and sampling times covered seasonal as well as weather effects, particularly the effects of storm-associated rainfall. Benthic surveys were also carried out in control and impacted sites several times over the period 2004 &#8211; 2006. To complement the results from the longer term monitoring of water quality and reef benthic communities, a number of short-term, targeted experiments were conducted in the laboratory and in the field, to examine nutrient uptake by algae, herbivory impacts and nutrient sources. A combination of the Line Transect and Quadrat Point Intercept methods were used for the assessment of the abundances and distribution of the main species on the fringing reefs, especially Sargassum sp. Nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted in the laboratory and also in the field to assess uptake of nutrients by Sargassum sp.  Herbivore-exclusion caging experiments were conducted in the field to assess influence of herbivory in a &#8216;tabu&#8217; or marine protected area (MPA) as well, as in non-&#8216;tabu&#8217; or open-fishing sites. Samples of Sargassum sp. and a few other dominant macroalgae species from the study sites were analysed for tissue nitrogen and phosphorus contents and for &#61540;15N content, to aid nutrient source identification.Nutrient concentrations were highly variable, showed little association with season, but were strongly linked to rainfall. The results indicated the clear influence of pulse (storm runoff related) events on the nutrient concentrations in the water column. Control sites generally recorded lower nutrient concentrations than impacted sites, confirming the anthropogenic effects on water column nutrients. The biological communities on the fringing reefs reflected the status of nutrients in the water column, i.e., reefs close to human impacts recorded higher abundances of macroalgae, especially Sargassum sp., and lower abundances of live corals.  The nutrient enrichment experiments showed the ability of Sargassum sp. to take up nutrients very quickly from the water column, but the rhizoids showed greater responses than the leafy shoots used in the experiments. The &#8216;low growth&#8217; season for Sargassum sp. during the Cool season (May to October) may be the explanation for the differential responses between the rhizoids, and the leafy parts of the Sargassum plants used in the experiment. Caging experiments showed the significance of herbivory in the control of Sargassum sp., and the &#8216;tabu&#8217; sites appeared to show a greater intensity of herbivory (lower suvivorship for uncaged shoots). Both tissue nutrient and &#61540;15N contents in macroalgae samples matched the findings from the water column nutrient studies, i.e., the human-impacted sites exhibited nutrient enrichment in the water column and in the macroalgae on the reef flats. Sargassum samples from impacted sites had higher tissue % N and higher &#61540;15N contents compared to the control sites confirming that human activities were enriching the coastal waters with nutrients. On the basis of the results from this research, recommendations are proposed for better management of nutrient sources on land for the protection of the water quality, and therefore promote healthier coral reef systems. The significance of protecting herbivorous species is also important, and the setting aside of &#8216;tabu&#8217; sites is encouraged. Areas of further research are also identified, for better understanding of the interrelationships among all the factors involved in the phase shift occurring on the fringing reefs along the Coral Coast of south-western Viti Levu, Fiji.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of superconducting and electromagnetic properties of un-doped and organic compound doped MgB2 conductors</field><field name="creator">Al-Hossain, Shahriar</field><field name="description">In this thesis I emphasized on the organic compound doping (specially carbohydrate group, malic acid, C4H6O5) and heat treatment effects on the superconducting properties of MgB2. I also focused on the basic and fundamental properties of un-doped MgB2 wires in different temperatures for comparison purpose. And finally I have proposed another new dopant which avoids some problems using carbohydrate in some aspects.Firstly, I have studied the effects of sintering temperature on the phase transformation, lattice parameters, full width at half-maximum (FWHM), strain, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and resistivity (_) in MgB2/Fe wires. All samples were fabricated by the in situ powder-in-tube method (PIT) and sintered within a temperature range of 650&#8211;900 _C. I have showed that why I have taken such sintering temperature range by analyzing with differential thermal analysis (DTA). The increased FWHM and decreased Tc at low sintering temperature region suggested the smaller grain size and poor crystallinity. Strain values also higher at low sintering region. That&#8217;s why it was observed that wires sintered at low temperature, 650 _C, resulted in higher Jc up to 12 T. The best transport Jc value reached 4200 A cm&#8722;2 at 4.2 K and 10 T. This is related to the grain boundary pinning due to small grain size and poor crystallinity due to strain defects. On the other hand, wires sintered at 900 _C had a lower Jc in combination with better crystallinity due to higher Tc.The effect of carbohydrate doping on lattice parameters, microstructure, Tc, Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2 has been studied. In this work I used malic acid, C4H6O5 as an example of 2 carbohydrates as an additive to MgB2. We have described the advantages of carbohydrate doping include homogeneous mixing of precursor powders, avoidance of expansive nanoadditives, production of highly reactive C, and significant enhancement in Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2, compared to un-doped samples. The defects due to the C substitution into boron site lead to the enhancement of Hirr and Hc2. The decrease of a-axis lattice parameter and reduction of Tc indicates poor crystallinity due to C substitution. The microstructure was shown both for un-doped and doped samples which were well consistent with FWHM. The Jc for MgB2+30 wt% C4H6O5 sample was increased by a factor of 21 at 5 K and 8 T without degradation of self-field Jc due to C substitution into B sites.During the evaporation process of the C4H6O5 with B and solvent, freshly and highly reactive C is produced and C substitution for B can take place at the temperature same as the formation temperature of MgB2. By using this chemical route I again evaluated the doping effects of C4H6O5, from 0 to 30 wt% of the total MgB2, on the lattice parameters, lattice strain, amount of carbon (C) substitution, microstructures, weight fraction of MgO, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and irreversibility field (Hirr) of a MgB2 superconductor. The calculated lattice parameters show a large decrease in the aaxis lattice parameter for MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples from 3.0861(6) to 3.0736(1) &#197;, with even a 10 wt% addition. This is an indication of C substitution into boron sites, with the C coming from C4H6O5, resulting in enhancement of Jc and Hirr. Specifically, the Hirr of the MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples prepared by the chemical solution route reached around 7 T at 20 K, with a Tc reduction of only 1.5 K. In addition, the self-field Jc of the MgB2 + 3 C4H6O5 samples was only slightly reduced at an additive level as high as 30 wt%. The interesting thing I found here is maximum C-substitution and the maximum enhancement of all the superconducting parameters up to 10 wt% addition, after that the improvement rate is saturated. From these data I can claim 10 wt% addition is enough for maximum Csubstitution and enhancement of superconducting properties. However, residual oxygen after evaporation processing contributed to a large amount of MgO in our MgB2 + 30 wt% C4H6O5 samples. These problems can be further controlled by the amount of C4H6O5 additive or different evaporation temperatures.After the successful doping effects of C4H6O5 into MgB2, then I investigated the behaviour of C4H6O5 as a dopant with different sintering temperatures. All the samples were prepared by the chemical solution route. I report the carbon (C) substitution effects of MgB2 + 10 wt% C4H6O5 on the lattice parameters, critical temperature (Tc), upper critical field (Hc2), and irreversibility field (Hirr) as a function of sintering temperature in the range from 600 to 900 _C. The additive C4H6O5 as the C source resulted in a small depression in Tc, but significantly increased the C substitution level, and hence improved the Hc2 and Hirr performance at a low sintering temperature of 600 _C in conjunction with a short sintering period of 4 h. In addition, the low-temperature sintering process resulted in small grain size and higher impurity scattering compared to a pure MgB2 superconductor which promotes the flux pinning significantly.Very recently, I have chosen another solid hydrocarbon dopant named pyrene (C16H10) in to MgB2. There are few reasons behind this decision. Firstly we know all the carbohydrates consist of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). During the 4 evaporation process of C4H6O5, I noticed that the MgO amount is gradually increased with increasing doping level. So our group suggests such special solid hydrocarbon without O content which may reduce the MgO content within the matrix. In this work, we report on significantly enhanced Jc in MgB2 superconductor that was easily obtained by doping with a hydrocarbon, highly active C16H10, and using a sintering temperature as low as 600 &#176;C. The processing advantages of the C16H10 additive include production of a highly active carbon C source, an increased level of disorder, and the introduction of small grain size, resulting in enhancement of Jc.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reform of Indonesian law in the post-Soeharto era (1998-1999)</field><field name="creator">Hosen, Nadirsyah</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses on law reform in Indonesia during 1998-1999 when BJ Habibie took over the presidency from Soeharto who was forced to step down by the students&#65533; movement.

The thesis takes the position that since good governance and the rule of law had been absent during the thirty-two years of Soeharto presidency, law reform in the post Soeharto era should fulfil the characteristics of good governance and promote the rule of law. Therefore, the main question addressed here is: did the seven laws produced under Habibie government achieve the standard of the promotion of good governance and the rule of law? In order to answer the question, I evaluate those laws at three levels: drafting process, content, and implementation. The thesis also considers demands for reform, Habibies motivation/interest, political tension and compromise, along with national and international pressures, as additional explanations.

At present the situation in some developing countries is that communication and exchange of information between the government agencies are still paper-based. It can often take weeks or months for one government agency to obtain the records it requires from another agency. The lack of communication between these agencies often results in duplication of efforts and inefficiencies. This lack of communication also means that agencies often produce more of the irrelevant albeit sophisticated information (such as the Statistics Division) than the essential information that is critical and actually needed by other agency for decision making. (World Bank report, 1998) In order to bring people into information society, to have access to information, it is crucial to have appropriate technology and applications that compatible with both old and new technologies&#8212;given that majority can not afford to keep up with new technologies being introduced everyday--as well as quality programming in indigenous languages, To create an information society in developing countries, we must first have knowledge of their past, understand their present. Only then participating in their future can be more probable and possible (Matsepe-Casaburri 1996) The overall aim of this study is to add value to the process of information sharing among the government departments in Thailand. It does this by analyzing the opportunity to integrate existing technology with the data available in existing databases and make it more valuable for future use. A case study of the Department of Local Administration, under the Ministry of Interior, and the Royal Thai Police Department is used to develop an understanding of how the utilization of data to a full extent can be beneficial in the government service. In Thailand, every Thai citizen is required to carry a national identity card. Personal data of each person such as date of birth, height, blood type, religion and occupation, including registered address and individual photograph image, are kept in the Central Registration Database Systems (CRDS). The CRDS is operated by the Department of Local Administration under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior. In order to maximize the benefits from this database, the CRDS is shared by other authorized government agencies. The Royal Thai Police Department is one of the government agencies that also share the information from the CRDS. Frequently, the individual registration database and photographs from CRDS are needed to support crime investigation. This research therefore, investigates how the Thai government could utilize the existing database system to aid in the crime investigation process. It then suggests an effective method of image retrieval to support police officers when searching criminal records from a Central Registration Database Systems.The research begins with an exploratory study of the use and sharing of information amongst the government agencies in developing countries. It examines the use of existing technology and how the Government uses technology to access information. There are two major objectives in this research. The first one addresses how value can be added to the present data in the existing system.

The cleaning workers in this study were from three sectors of the workforce &#8211; government schools, hospitality and commercial office space. The vacuum cleaning tasks were divided into those performed with a back pack style vacuum cleaning machine and those using a canister/barrel machine. Three observational risk assessment tools were selected to measure the risk of these tasks to cleaning workers. The selected tools were the Manual Tasks Risk Assessment Tool (ManTRA) version 2.0; the Quick Exposure Check (QEC) (Li &amp; Buckle, 1998); and the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tool (RULA) (McAtamney &amp; Corlett, 1993). Results of this thesis study demonstrated that vacuum cleaning is a risk to the musculoskeletal health of cleaning workers, with some variation between the tool ratings, reflecting the specificity and/or sensitivity of each tool. Differences were found between the three cleaning sectors in terms of overall risk posed by vacuum cleaning tasks. The sector with the greatest risk was found to be the government school cleaners, followed by the hospitality and then commercial office space cleaning sectors. The &#8216;risk experience&#8217; difference between the sectors cannot be attributed only to vacuum cleaner characteristics, but also, the environment and length of shift worked by the cleaning staff. Further research is required to determine the difference in risk exposure between the two types of vacuum cleaner (back pack and canister).</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of binaural ultrasonic sensing systems</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Benjamin D</field><field name="description">Autonomous robotic systems have been under development for a number of years. This development is being driven partly by the need to explore the processes and logic that humans use in accomplishing repetitive tasks and partly by the need to provide probes and vehicles in environments that present threats to humans. It is this need to send robots into harsh environments which has provided the impetus for this thesis to explore the use of binaural ultrasonic sensors for robotic agents thereby enabling them to take the place of living agents. In all, five sensor systems were built and investigated. Two systems were based upon matched filters with Barker codes. The first used quadrature demodulation while the second used unsynchronised demodulation. The remaining three systems used continuous tone frequency modulated signals. The first was implemented with a discrete Fourier transform spectral estimator, the second with a Yule-Walker spectral estimator and the third using a least squares modified Yule-Walker spectral estimator. The construction, implementation and testing of these five sonar systems reveals that there is no clear preferred system despite the significantly different methodologies adopted to determine the basic time of flight and received power information. The more classical matched filter systems have superior distance of flight precision compared to the newer continuous tone frequency modulated class. However it is clearly demonstrated that the continuous tone frequency modulated class is able to insonify a larger area and operate with a better signal to noise ratio. Once calibrated, this class of sonar is able to at least equal the performance of the matched filter class. The thesis focuses on the rigorous determination of the range and bearing tuple from both the theoretical or model viewpoint and the experimental viewpoint. A rigorous theoretical development of both the inter-aural distance difference and the inter-aural power difference methods of computing bearing and the resolution of the correspondence problem are included. Experimental work was undertaken to validate the models and to provide data on which comparative study may be based. The conventional metric quantities were acquired with a large level of redundancy thereby allowing the determination of strong statistics associated with accuracy, precision and resolution. This thesis shows that, while there are performance differences between the systems, the se-lection of the best system is application dependent. In this work the aim is to equip a robotic agent with a sensory system enabling it to function in the place of a living agent, especially in a harsh or dangerous environment. For this purpose the system suggested by this thesis is a continuous tone frequency modulated sonar system with a least squares modified Yule-Walker spectral estimator.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Securing digital images</field><field name="creator">Kailasanathan, Chandrapal</field><field name="description">With the advent of the Internet and World Wide Web, images are being transferred over insecure channels from different parts of the world. Those who receive images may not exactly know where they have originated from or who their sender was. In those circumstances, determining the authenticity of received images would be extremely difficult and therefore providing authenticity to images has been considered as an essential area of image security research. On the other hand, processing images for storage reduction, noise removal, or quality enhancement, is also essential in many computer applications, because images are inherently larger than text and are subject to noise or transcoding. The authentication of image is achieved either by appending a Message Authentication Code or a Signature to an image or by embedding a watermark into the image which is fragile to any modification. On the other hand, storage reduction for images is mainly achieved by lossy compression techniques such as JPEG or MPEG, and the quality enhancement or noise reduction for images is accomplished by employing filtering techniques such as Median or Gaussain. In this thesis, we propose hash functions which extract essential image features that survive acceptable level of JPEG compression while distinguishing other modifications using statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, hypothesis of testing, and k-mean clustering, and wavelet/discrete cosine transform. For the proposed transform based hash functions, we optimise performance by fixing some essential parameters such as the size of hash, the value of the threshold and the low-pass filter used. We also propose two oblivious fragile watermarking schemes. The first one embeds a logo on feature points or critical point extracted using wavelet or discrete cosine transform, and the next one embeds a logo on image blocks based on polarity of pixel points. For the proposed schemes, after analysing the security level, the possibilities of embedding multiple logos for secret sharing have also been investigated. The appendix of the thesis addresses some of our early work on combined compression and encryption scheme based on adaptive Huffman coding, compression performance of a proposed JPEG encryption scheme, and cryptanalysis of Huffman coding with four symbol alphabet.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of MgB2 superconductors</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Sihai</field><field name="description">Several projects are reported in this thesis. These projects deal with the processing of MgB(subscript 2) bulk samples and metal-sheathed wires or tapes. The main focus is on the fabrication aspects. The correlation between fabrication parameters and superconductivity properties is studied extensively. MgB(subscript 2) tapes and wires were prepared by the Powder-In-Tube (PIT) method. Ag, Cu and Fe were chosen to act as sheath materials. The interaction between the sheath materials and the MgB(subscript 2) core was studied. It was found that the MgB(subscript 2) superconducting tapes sheathed in copper exhibited a higher critical current density than Fe-sheathed tapes if prepared at temperatures below 850(degrees)C. However, in term of the core composition and microstructure, the Fe sheathed tapes had the most pure MgB(subscript 2) phase only with a few micro cracks regardless of the heat treatment conditions. Increases in the overall mechanic deformation rate did not influence the J(subscript c) value of the Fe-sheathed tapes, whereas the J(subscript c) of the Cu-sheathed tapes grew by up to an order of magnitude with an increasing thickness reduction rate. The Ag-sheathed tapes usually showed very poor performance in term of the core microstructure, composition and critical current density, indicating that Ag is not appropriate for sheathing MgB(subscript 2). MgB(subscript 2) Fe-sheathed wires were made by both in-situ and ex-situ approaches. The wires made using the ex-situ method did not show such high I(subscript c) as those made by the in-situ method. In the case of 7-filament wires, the adoption of an additional mechanic deformation in in-situ method can increase J(subscript c) by a factor of 2.7 compared with the initial single filament wires. After further sintering, J(subscript c) can increase by 4.3 times. However, in 19 filament and 49 filament wires, after second sintering, I(subscript c) was blocked by micro cracks and impurities. Effects on the wire induced by exposure to air were studied, with J(subscript c) decreasing by 20% after aging in air for 4 months. The decrease was attributed to the oxidation of the remnant unreacted Mg oxidation after long time exposure to air. Different mechanical deformations were adopted to make Fe-sheathed MgB(subscript 2) wires. It was found that square rolling is more beneficial than drawing in term of improving I(subscript c). The mass density of the MgB(subscript 2) core was improved after further mechanical deformation, but the I(subscript c) did not increase accordingly. The cracks caused by mechanical deformation are very difficult to heal with post annealing. The formula (MgB[subscript 2])(subscript 1-x): (Mg+2B)(subscript x) was used to fabricate MgB(subscript 2) bulk (where x varies from 0 to 1). The critical current density as a function of the applied field is larger over the entire field range for samples with x?0. An addition to the un-reacted Mg+2B mixture to the MgB(subscript 2) powder enhances the transparency of the grain boundaries, introducing an MgB(subscript 2) matrix that is formed in-situ with embedded small MgB(subscript 2) ex-situ particles (for 0?x?1). The grain boundaries are found to be responsible for the pinning of vortices. The larger x is, the smaller the amount of pinning boundaries, so that J(subscript c)(B) decays faster. MgB(subscript 2) was doped with nanometer size SiC particles. Si and C were introduced into the MgB(subscript 2) crystal lattice due to the counter balanced atomic sizes of Si and C, on average nearly coinciding with the size of B. T(subscript c) was reduced slightly by the doping. However, the doping was shown to strongly improve J(subscript c)(H) dependence at high applied fields. A pinning mechanism explaining this improvement is suggested, in which the main intra-granular ingredients are the dominant contribution of a larger number of dislocations induced by the substitution effect and a secondary contribution due to the nano-inclusions. The processing parameters for SiC doped MgB(subscript 2) wires have been studied systematically. The sintering temperature and time have strong effects on the T(subscript c) of the superconducting material. Higher temperatures and longer dwell times are beneficial to the T(subscript c) but not to the J(subscript c). Samples sintered at 750(degrees)C and 850(degrees)C exhibit higher J(subscript c) than those sintered at 680(degrees)C and 950(degrees)C. Sloww cooling has a beneficial effect on J(subscript c) field dependence. Uniaxial pressures (250 and 680 Mpa) improve the mass density but have a negligible effect on J(subscript c). The doping effects of C, Si and C+Si particles on J(subscript c)(H) have been studied. Nano-Si, C or (Si+C) dopant particles can improve J(subscript c)(H) performance at higher fields compared with undoped MgB(subscript 2). At 20K and 4T, J(subscript c) of the nano-Si doped sample reached 10(superscript 4)A/cm(superscript 2) which is 100 times higher than that of the coarse-Si doped sample. The J(subscript c) of nano-C doped samples is 10 times higher than that of the coarse-C doped sample. The nano-(Si+C) co-doped samples show similar behaviour to the nano Si doped sample whatever the ratio of Si to C. Coarse C or Si doping decreased J(subscript c) at all fields and all temperatures measured. MgB(subscript 2) wires have been synthesised with different B and Mg powders as well as different Mg: B ratios. The effects of B powder on the J(subscript c) and T(subscript c) of this superconductor are noticeable. Impurities in the B powder can suppress both the T(subscript c) and J(subscript c). Oxidizing the Mg powder did not have a strong influence on T(subscript c), although the effects on J(subscript c) are significant when the Mg powder is severely oxidized. The influence of lightly oxidized Mg powder on both T(subscript c) and J(subscript c) is negligible. If the MgB(subscript 2) composition fluctuates from the normal stoichiometricity of 1:2, T(subscript c) decreases with excessive Mg composition. A minor Mg deficiency (x?0.1 in Mg[subscript 1-x]B[subscript 2]) did not influence T(subscript c) strongly. J(subscript c) did not change dramatically with the variations in composition. A two-step sintering was used to synthesize MgB(subscript 2). However, although the mass density achieved in higher value, the critical current density dropped dramatically after the second grinding and sintering. The higher the first sintering temperature, the smaller the critical current density. The magnetic screening of the superconducting MgB(subscript 2) filaments in single and multifilament wires by means of an iron sheath has been directly visualized. The observations showed that the magnetic flux induced inside the iron sheath is higher than the applied field. The superconducting filaments exhibit an extended Meissner state and are free from the induced magnetic flux at least up to B = 0.2 T for both kinds of wires. This was observed by the magneto-optical technique used. Global magnetization measurements showed that the screen effect could be dominant up to B= 1.5 T and that it is much more effective in increasing fields than in decreasing fields.

This is done by undertaking a study into the extent to which these error correction codes can reduce the bit error rate across the space time spreading channel. Both the turbo codes and space time channel have been developed in Matlab&#65533;s Simulink. The thesis starts with an introduction to turbo codes which is presented on the basis of classical turbo codes introduced by Berrou et al in 1993 (Berrou et al., 1993). This is illustrated by some examples of their performance across the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGN). Then a detailed description of the Space Time Spreading (STS) channel and the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) turbo codes. Using the UMTS turbo codes this thesis produces simulation results showing to what extent they reduce the bit error rate of the STS channel. A description of the system in Simulink and Matlab is presented. The simulation results show that UMTS turbo codes applied on the top of the STS channel can improve the bit error rate performance by approximately 5dB. This is done at the expense of increased complexity and reduced effective data rate.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical studies for evaluating dynamic behaviour of prestressed concrete sleepers subject to severe impact loading</field><field name="creator">Kaewunruen, Sakdirat</field><field name="description">Rail operators are consistently demanding higher axle loads to compete effectively with other modes of transport, particularly for heavy haul freight of minerals. However, high axle loads can only be achieved by ensuring that the existing rail infrastructure can cope with the greater static and dynamic loads associated with the wheel-rail interactions. Premature cracking of prestressed concrete sleepers is often the result of high-intensity dynamic loading caused by wheel or rail irregularities. The high-magnitude wheel loads produced by a small percentage of &#8220;bad&#8221; wheels or rail head surface defects are crudely accounted for in the Australian Standard AS 1085.14 by a single load amplification factor. In addition, there is a widespread perception within the railway engineering community that the carrying capacity of the existing track infrastructure is not fully utilised, and concrete sleepers possess significant amounts of untapped reserve strength. This can be attributed to the current design philosophy for concrete sleepers, outlined in AS 1085.14. This is based on the assessment of permissible stresses resulting from quasi-static wheel loads and essentially the static response of concrete sleepers, making it unduly conservative and very costly for the railway organisations. This thesis addresses the identified deficiencies of the current design method through an in-depth analysis of the dynamic response of concrete sleepers under realistic loading conditions and proposes a more rational design procedure.In order to shift the conventional methodology to a more rational design method that involves more realistic dynamic response of concrete sleepers and performance-based design methodology, a significant research effort within the framework of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Railway Engineering and Technologies has been carried out to perform comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the dynamic response, and the dynamic resistance of prestressed concrete sleepers. The collaborative research between the University of Wollongong (UoW) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has addressed such important issues as the spectrum and amplitudes of dynamic forces applied to the railway track, evaluation of the reserve capacity of typical prestressed concrete sleepers designed to the current code AS 1085.14, and the development of a new limit states design concept.The comprehensive literature review highlighted the extremely limited research work that previously had been done in this field of research. In order to enhance an understanding of the dynamic performance of railway tracks, the first part of this thesis investigates the dynamic characteristics of the global railway track and its individual components with particular reference to rail pads and prestressed concrete (PC) sleepers. The experimental techniques for extracting dynamic properties of track components, developed in the laboratory, have been successfully applied in field trials. Moreover, this thesis provides an intensive review aimed at predicting wheel impact loads due to the wheel/rail irregularities at different return periods (based on the field data from wheel impact detectors).The experimental and numerical investigations into the dynamic behaviour of prestressed concrete sleepers subjected to severe impact loading are then presented. The impact tests were carried out using the prestressed concrete sleepers manufactured in Australia. A track test bed was simulated in the laboratory and calibrated against the frequency response functions obtained for real tracks. A series of incremental impact loading tests for the prestressed concrete sleepers was performed, ranging from a typical design load to a severe wheel load. The cumulative impact damage and crack propagation in concrete sleepers were identified. The effects of track environment together with the relationship between the bending moment of prestressed concrete sleepers and the applied impact force are also presented.The later part of this thesis identifies the responses of prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under both single and repeated impact loads associated with different probabilities of occurrence. The residual capacities of the damaged prestressed concrete sleepers are studied in order to clarify the notion about the reserve strength of the concrete sleepers. The numerical investigations of the static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under static and dynamic loads were also undertaken to supplement the experimental findings in this thesis.A proposal for the reliability-based design concepts and rationales associated with the development of limit states design procedures for the conversion of AS 1085.14 to a limit states design format is one of the key outcomes of this thesis. The new limit states design concepts and procedures for railway prestressed concrete sleepers are presented as the design guidelines for the railway engineers. The new methodology is aimed not only to save the material resources to achieve financial gains, but also to reduce the amount of cement production which would otherwise emit carbon dioxide as a contributing factor towards global warming.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New music composition for live performance and interactive multimedia</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Thomas A</field><field name="description">The focus of this DCA thesis is the development of original creative audio and audio-visual work.

The study explored the curriculum areas of citizenship education and foreign language education within the Human Society and Its Environment Key Learning Area in NSW primary schools, focusing on how the curricula contribute to the goals of intercultural understanding, and examined the potential of applying Japanese language learning education as one of the tools to serve the development of students&#8217; interculturality.The methodology used for this study is a qualitative paradigm.  The study is a case study with multiple contexts including two primary schools, a high school and a university. The methodology and analysis are framed by grounded theory. The researcher&#8217;s position in conducting this study is underpinned by cultural theory.  Literature on globalisation, citizenship, language education and interculturality were explored.  The participants were thirty primary school students from two different schools, five high school students and the teachers of their Japanese language classes, five university students who are studying the Japanese language as their major, and other stakeholders.  The researcher explored the participants&#8217; perceptions and beliefs regarding the multiple issues of identity, Japanese language teaching and learning and the development of interculturality. In addition, classroom observations were conducted and recorded over several months, curriculum documents were analysed, and teacher seminars and professional development courses were attended.  The data analyses, coding and classifying, were conducted in three phases, each building upon the results of the other, as revealed in the grounded theory approach. The results of this study are discussed around three key themes: self-identity construction through Japanese language learning experiences; schools as sites of cultural production and reproduction where the students&#8217; development of self-identity is crucially influenced; and language education for interculturality.  The students&#8217; school is a crucial location for the development of interculturality, where the curriculum can be planned to stimulate their subjective awareness of self, which is an important process in the development of this quality. The result indicates that Japanese language education can be a tool to promote and develop interculturality. Recommendations have been proposed in three major areas: the position of language education in the school curriculum; teachers&#8217; professional development to enhance their interculturality; and future research. Language education should be a compulsory subject within any primary school curriculum. It is revealed that the importance of developing interculturality has to be manifested, not as a by-product of schooling, but should be purposefully directed. The notion of intercultural competency while learning a foreign language opens up new dimensions for the language teaching arena. Professional development of teachers, and longitudinal research to follow the outcomes of new language teaching approaches are crucial for today&#8217;s society.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between parental divorce and the psychological well-being of children with AD/HD: differences in subtypes, age, gender and comorbidity</field><field name="creator">Heckel, Leila</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) results from a dysfunction of the central nervous system, which has led to a commonly-held belief that environmental factors play little role in the behavioural problems of these children. However, this perspective has been poorly investigated. This thesis examined the relationship between parental divorce and the psychological well-being of children with AD/HD. Subjects were aged 6 to 18 years and were diagnosed with either the inattentive or combined subtype of the disorder. Firstly, the relationship between parental divorce and the symptom profile of children with AD/HD was investigated. Differences in children&#8217;s behaviour between (a) divorced and non-divorced families, (b) single-parent households and step-families, and (c) single-divorced and multiple-divorced parents, were examined. A possible relationship between the quality of family relationships and children&#8217;s symptom profile was investigated. Subtype, age, and gender differences were evaluated in terms of symptom severity and comorbid conditions. Secondly, parents&#8217; perceptions of the impact of their children&#8217;s behaviour on marital status and family/parental functioning were examined. The major results were that (a) parental divorce was associated with greater symptom severity, more externalizing/internalizing behaviours, and poorer social functioning, but less with academic underachievement, (b) children living in step-families presented with greater impairment than those in single-parent households, (c) differences in psychological well-being between children with AD/HD of single- and multiple-divorced parents were minor, (d) poor relationships with family members correlated with children&#8217;s overall behaviour, (e) parental divorce was related to adjustment differences in AD/HD subtypes, age, and gender, and (f) the correlation between behaviour problems of children with AD/HD and marital/family dysfunction was weak. It may be concluded that parental divorce was associated with the psychological well being in children with AD/HD, and there is some suggestion to view AD/HD as a bio-psychosocial disorder.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling, analysis and control of linear feed axes in precision machine tools</field><field name="creator">Moscrop, Jeffrey W</field><field name="description">The precision control of linear feed axes in machine tools is examined in this thesis. Al&#172;though high precision in machining has been a focal point for engineers for over 200 years, the traditional solutions have often been based on complex mechanical designs. In this thesis, two aspects of feed axis controller design are examined: i) the use of appropriate mathematical models and ii) the signi&#64257;cance of three of the most common performance limiting factors that have traditionally affected precision in linear feed axes. The three particular performance limiting factors considered are: i) dynamic stiffness, ii) torsional vibrations and iii) backlash. The most effective way of obtaining knowledge about a control system is through appro&#172;priate mathematical modelling. A new two-body model for a simple motor-transmission&#172;load system is presented in this thesis. This new model is shown to provide a more accurate representation of both the total inertia and lowest natural frequency of a system, when compared with the two-body model that is traditionally used by researchers and system designers. A new model to represent backlash in a two-body system is also pre&#172;sented. These new models are then extended to provide accurate mathematical models of four common linear feed axis drive con&#64257;gurations: i) a rotary motor driving a rack and pinion transmission, ii) a rotary motor directly driving a ballscrew transmission, iii) a rotary motor driving a ballscrew transmission via a synchronous belt, and iv) a linear motor directly driving the axis. Different control solutions to the problems of dynamic stiffness, torsional vibrations and backlash are examined in this thesis, with each controller implemented on specially con&#172;structed test-beds. An approach using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented xxi for systems with inherently low dynamic stiffness. This QFT approach is shown to pro&#172;vide a transparent design process, which results in high dynamic stiffness. Different controllers for torsional vibrations are compared both theoretically and experimentally, with many previously published solutions shown to be theoretically equivalent. A new backlash controller is also presented, which is shown experimentally to provide dynamic stability and good tracking performance at both high and low velocities. The importance of treating these performance limiting factors simultaneously is also ad&#172;dressed in this thesis, with the control solutions developed to address some factors shown to also affect the other factors. The QFT approach is shown to provide a suitable inte&#172;grated design process, where the implications of any compromises, on the control of each factor, are clearly visible.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managers' stereotypes and their relation to employment decision-making in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Partridge, Barry R</field><field name="description">This study set out to establish the type and nature of decision-making that managers displayed at work, and ways in which those decisions may be related to managers&#8217; stereotyping of their colleagues. Ninety nine managers, drawn from six age-gender categories, made 594 employment decisions on six different age-gender categories of workplace colleagues. Managers&#8217; employment decisions were found to vary according to differences in the managers&#8217; own age-gender category with younger female managers more negative in their decision-making and younger male, older male and older female managers more positive in their decisions.The study made innovative use of a Personal Construct Theory-based (PCT) methodology (Kelly, 1955), to gain insights into managers&#8217; decision-making. A process of measuring manager-colleague social proximity determined managers&#8217; perceived differences from colleagues, and provided a means of comparing social distance measures with managers&#8217; employment decisions. Research aimed to establish whether managers&#8217; perceived social proximity with colleagues could vary according to differences in managers&#8217; or colleagues&#8217; age-gender categories, and if colleagues perceived more socially proximate would be assigned positive decisions by managers and those colleagues more distant, negative decisions. Study results confirmed managers&#8217; perceived social proximity with colleagues varied according to differences in managers&#8217; and colleagues&#8217; age-gender categories and managers were positive in their decisions on socially proximate, younger colleagues and negative in their decision-making, on more socially distant older ones.Stereotype research in the study sought to determine levels of abstraction with which managers held information in their stereotypes, and uses to which managers put that information in making employment choices between colleagues. A PCT-based methodology helped identify managers&#8217; workplace stereotypes and established relations between managers&#8217; stereotypes and their employment decisions. The managers&#8217; more meaningful interpretation of colleagues, expressed through superordinacy of constructs and commonality of usage of salient constructs, helped describe managers&#8217; stereotyping processes and identified those stereotypes managers were most likely to act on in their decision-making. The managers&#8217; stereotypes were found to hold both positive and negative prejudicial perceptions of the same person and to vary according to colleagues&#8217; age-gender category. Stereotype research results showed positive superordinate constructs associated with managers&#8217; stereotypes on younger age-gender categories as significantly related to managers&#8217; positive decisions on younger male and female colleagues. On the other hand, negative superordinate constructs associated with stereotypes on older female colleagues were significantly related to managers&#8217; negative decisions on the older female category. Positive stereotypes on younger colleagues, describing them as helpful and hardworking, were related to more positive employment decisions on younger males and females while negative stereotypes describing older females as traditional in approach and not being a good training investment were related to more negative decisions made on their category.Stereotype and decision research carried out in the study established the nature of managers&#8217; discriminatory decision-making and relation to managers&#8217; stereotyping of colleagues.

However, due to the difficulty in differentiating thermoregulatory functions of the spinal cord from those of higher centres in humans, the role of the spinal cord in certain aspects of thermoregulation remains unclear. Subjects with spinal cord injury have unique neural changes providing an opportunity to evaluate the role of the spinal cord, independently of higher thermoregulatory centres. Subjects with (N=11) and without (N=11) spinal cord injury were studied in a series of experiments, in which a wide range of local and whole-body temperature changes and postural manipulations were imposed. During these trials, various physiological (skin temperature, core temperature, local sweat rate and sweat expulsion frequency - a measure of central sympathetic drive), and psychophysical variables (thermal sensation and discomfort) were investigated. Six key observations arose from these experiments: (i) Subjects with spinal cord injury had a lower thermoafferent capacity (secondary to neural damage) and a corresponding reduction in thermoefferent drive (sudomotor sensitivity of 4.2 versus 8.8 expulsions&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#61616;C-1 in able-bodied; P=0.03). (ii) Equations used to approximate thermoafferent drive in able-bodied subjects, overestimated thermal feedback in subjects with spinal cord injury. However, this could be corrected by modifying the skin area weightings to include only the sensate areas. (iii) No subjects with physiologically-confirmed thermoefferent spinal cord injury displayed sweating from insensate skin sites, indicating that a spinal cord that has been isolated from higher centres cannot induce thermal sweating. (iv) Subjects with spinal cord injury had higher forehead sweat rates (0.77 versus 0.52 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1; P=0.03), but an equivalent sweat sensitivity (1.24 versus 1.27 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#176;C-1; P=0.94), indicating the presence of a peripheral adaptation to sustain thermal homeostasis, and secondary to reduced thermal afferent and efferent flow. (v) Respiratory frequency increased more for a given increase in body temperature in subjects with spinal cord injury (2.4 versus 1.1 breaths&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#176;C-1; P=0.042), but this did not provide a thermoregulatory benefit. (vi) Subjects with spinal cord injury demonstrated greater changes in behavioural thermoregulatory indicators (thermal sensation and discomfort) in response to standardised local and whole-body thermal loads. Collectively, these observations indicate the unique nature of thermoregulation in people with spinal cord injury and the adaptive ability of the human thermoregulatory system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The larrikin subject: hegemony and subjectivity in late nineteenth century Sydney</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kylie</field><field name="description">The problem of social disorder has figured prominently in Australian historiography and in contemporary social theorising. However, the traditional categories of historical analysis provide a limited set of tools through which to understand the complexities of human behaviour in the past. By writing a social ontology into history, it is possible to rethink how &#8216;ways of being&#8217; in the world are both constructed and represented, and to reconsider the consequences of this for our understanding of both history and the present.The way in which certain types of social disorder have been analysed in Australian history has meant that some social groups, or behavioural types, have been marginalised and excluded. This is the case with the figure of &#8216;the larrikin&#8217;, a common type in Australian historiography, yet represented in such a way that our understanding of them today bears little resemblance to the way in which they were understood in their own time. This discrepancy has been brought about through the tendency of some historical approaches to focus on the institutions and structures of nation building, or on the recognisably political forms of &#8216;organised labour&#8217;. This type of analysis can only take our understanding of human behaviour so far.Psychoanalytic theory as developed by Freud and Lacan helps to show the way in which &#8216;civilised society&#8217; relies on the repression and sublimation of &#8216;instinctual&#8217; types of human behaviour, but that in so doing, a part of the human self is excluded. This exclusion occurs at both the personal and the social level, as the &#8216;civilised&#8217; self, the &#8216;civilised society&#8217;, can only exist against what it has excluded. This psychoanalytic theory is linked with the work of Antonio Gramsci to show that what is excluded, and the process of exclusion, is related to the process of establishing hegemony, and that the resultant exclusion is the basis of subalternity.In late nineteenth century Sydney, the term &#8216;larrikinism&#8217; came to represent a particular set of behaviours which were considered problematic for the development of &#8216;civilised society&#8217;. An examination of the hegemonic mechanisms by which the exclusion of larrikin behaviour could occur, demonstrates that the imagination of a civilised society in late nineteenth century Sydney was centred around certain hegemonic principles which required a particular kind of human self &#8211; a disciplined worker, a desiring consumer &#8211; and suggests that larrikins resisted this process. Larrikins were made subaltern because they were a form of &#8216;subjectivity&#8217;, or a way of being in the world, that sought to challenge the making of a kind of human self considered necessary for industrial capitalism. In this way, larrikin behaviour can be understood as a type of &#8216;excess&#8217;, a frontier in the battle for hegemony around notions of youth, respectability and discipline.This historical process did not stop in 1899 but continued into the twentieth century and beyond, and continues to have ramifications for the way in which we think notions of politics and agency, and for the ways in which subaltern groups in contemporary society continue to be marginalised and excluded.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Membrane lipid composition and its effect on sodium pump molecular activity: a comparative study</field><field name="creator">Turner, Nigel</field><field name="description">The basal metabolic rate (BMR) or energy turnover of animals varies dramatically, being several fold higher in endotherms compared to ectotherms, and much greater, on a mass-specific basis, in smaller vertebrates compared to larger vertebrates. Despite this large variation in metabolic rate between vertebrate species, a significant and relatively constant proportion of metabolism is associated with membrane-linked energy consuming processes, regardless of the absolute level of BMR. The majority of these membrane-linked processes are mediated by membrane-bound enzymes, and in general, membranes with increased levels of polyunsaturation are associated with elevated activity in these processes and subsequently increased metabolism. It has therefore been suggested that membranes, specifically their amount and composition, may be playing a role in determining the pace (or rate) of metabolism, via an effect on the molecular activity of membrane-bound proteins. In this thesis, the relationship between membrane lipid composition and molecular activity of the sodium pump (Na(superscript +)K(superscript +)ATPase) has been assessed via comparisons of a large range of different animals. The sodium pump was chosen as a representative protein, as it is ubiquitous, has been well characterised, and accounts for a major proportion of resting energy metabolism (20%). Furthermore recent comparisons of endotherms and ectotherms, have suggested that the molecular activity of the sodium pump is highly dependent on the lipid composition of the surrounding membrane bilayer. The aims of this study were firstly to examine sodium pump molecular activity and membrane lipid composition in tissues of mammals and birds of different body size. The mammalian species examined ranged in body mass 7500-fold and had an 11-fold difference in mass-specific BMR, while the avian species ranged 3000-fold and 22-fold for body mass and mass-specific BMR respectively. These species were chosen to try and maximise metabolic differences, and represented an ideal model to examine whether variations in membrane lipid composition may have been determining the metabolic activity of these vertebrates, through an effect on membrane-bound proteins (i.e. sodium pump). The second major aim of this study was to examine sodium pump molecular activity and membrane lipid composition in tissues from two ectothermic species, the bearded dragon lizard, and the octopus. These species were chosen as the bearded dragon has been shown to have very monounsaturated membranes, which are typical of ectotherms, while membranes from the octopus tend to be very polyunsaturated. Sodium pump molecular activity has been shown to be low in a large range of ectotherms and this study was designed to examine whether the high level of polyunsaturation in octopus membranes was associated with an increased molecular activity in their sodium pumps. In the mammals and birds membrane fatty acid composition showed substantial variation, with higher unsaturation index (number of double bonds per 100 fatty acid chains) observed in heart and kidney phospholipids from the smaller species. In these tissues the most important finding was the significant and substantial allometric decline observed in the content of the highly polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3). Brain phospholipids from the mammals and birds however, showed no allometric trends and were highly polyunsaturated (especially 22:6 n-3) in all species. Sodium pump molecular activity was generally higher in all three tissues from the smaller mammals, while in the birds higher molecular activity was observed in the hearts of smaller birds, while no allometric trends were seen in the kidney and brain. There were no differences observed in sodium pump molecular activity between the tissues of the bearded dragon and the octopus, in spite of the fact that the octopus had very polyunsaturated membranes. A significant contributing factor however, may have been that the octopus membranes contained high levels of cholesterol, which has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the sodium pump. To determine the relationship between sodium pump molecular activity and membrane lipid composition, linear correlation coefficients were determined between lipid parameters and sodium pump molecular activity, using a combined data set from all fifteen species and six tissues examined in the current study, plus literature values for tissues from the ectothermic cane toad. While several lipid parameters were correlated with molecular activity, the most significant relationship was observed for docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3), with high concentrations of this fatty acid associated with high sodium pump molecular activity. This fatty acid provided not only the strongest correlation for the combined data set, but was also significantly correlated within the mammals, birds and ectotherms, indicating that it may potentially play an important role in metabolism. Further research is required to determine the mechanistic basis of this relationship, however the physical properties of this fatty acid may be a major contributing factor.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless ad-hoc control networks</field><field name="creator">Bu, Shengrong</field><field name="description">Control systems have gone through major changes over the last decades, evolving from fully analogue systems to distributed digital controllers. The initial architecture of the computer control systems was central, as all the sensors and actuators were connected to a high performance computer. As the number of sensors and actuators deployed in the control systems increased significantly, this approach revealed many weaknesses such as high cost, poor reliability, poor maintainability, and limited extensibility. With the emergence of low cost microprocessors, the computer controlled system adopted a more distributed architecture. Direct Digital Control (DDC) was the first distributed control system formally recognised in the literature and industry. Currently, control networks represent the latest development of the control systems architecture in industry. They combine localized intelligent digital controllers networked to a supervisory computer for data exchange and synchronization. A new concept called Wireless ad-hoc control networks (WACNets), as the next stage in the evolution of control systems architecture is studied in this thesis. Such systems consist of a large number of nodes with sensing and/or actuation, local intelligence and control, and data processing and communication components. The size, number, density, capabilities and location-dependency of such nodes are determined by the specific application for which the nodes are employed. The protocols and algorithms that run on the nodes could also provide self-organizing and cooperative capabilities for random deployment of the nodes. In addition to the development of a conceptual model for WACNets, a test-bed for validation of the concept based on IEEE 1451 compliant Smart Sensor and Bluetooth standard is designed and developed. In order to validate the test-bed and the concept, a monitor is also developed which provides interaction and communication with the nodes in the network from a host computer. The other contributions of the thesis include the design and development of a service discovery protocol based on Bluetooth Standard, a suite of software driving the test-bed, and validation of the test-bed. The results of the validation as presented in the thesis are quite encouraging and strongly indicate that the approach is feasible.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of weed invasion and control on plant-bird interactions and bird communities</field><field name="creator">Gosper, Carl R</field><field name="description">Introduced plants can have a variety of impacts in ecosystems in which they become invasive. These impacts can include the disruption of interactions between native plant and animal species, such as seed dispersal and pollination. Subsequently, other interactions and mutualisms can be affected, both at the site of the plant invasion and elsewhere. Interactions can also become established between the invasive plant and native and invasive animal species. The removal of an invasive plant has the potential to disrupt these newly formed interactions, thus disadvantaging some fauna and potentially affecting subsequent interactions involving these species. While control of invasive plants is typically a goal of conservation management, the consequences of control for other species are rarely fully considered or investigated. In this study, I have tested several hypotheses regarding the interaction of an invasive plant with fauna, and the effects of the plant&#8217;s invasion and control on plant-animal interactions.Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata) is an invasive plant in coastal New South Wales (NSW), Australia. South African in origin, it has now spread to occupy at least 80% of the NSW coastline. Fruit production in C. monilifera is prolific and fruits are consumed and dispersed by vertebrates, especially birds. In addition to other effects of C. monilifera, this plant-animal interaction has the potential to affect the seed dispersal of other  vertebratedispersed plants and also the composition of the bird community, which may subsequently affect other plant-bird interactions. In order to quantify the magnitude of these possible effects, I designed this study with the following five major components: (i) comparison of the fruiting characteristics of C. monilifera with those of co-occurring birddispersed native plant species; (ii) description of the plant-bird interactions that involve flowers and fruits in vegetation that has been invaded or is at risk of invasion by C. monilifera; (iii) measurement of the rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits and those of some co-occurring bird-dispersed plant species in: habitat dominated by C. monilifera, where C. monilifera had been eliminated by the application of herbicide, and uninvaded vegetation; (iv) assessment of the effect of C. monilifera removal by herbicide application on the species composition and abundance of the bird community; and (v) assessment of the effect of dominance of the vegetation community by C. monilifera on the species composition and abundance of the bird community. I found that the fruits of C. monilifera are within the range of physical dimensions and nutrient composition of those of co-occurring native species. The greatest distinction in fruit  characteristics is in phenology and the combination of phenology and morphology, as peak production of C. monilifera fruits occurs when native fruits are scarce. Consequently, C. monilifera fruits are attractive to vertebrate dispersers, especially birds. At least 25 species of birds feed on C. monilifera fruits in NSW, most of which are indigenous and are likely to disperse viable seeds.In an experimental study using feeding stations, I found that the rate of removal of fruits of native plant species was unaffected by either dense infestation of C. monilifera, or its elimination. This is likely to be due to highly facultative relationships between frugivorous birds and plants, combined with differences in phenology and, in some cases, the morphology of fruits of native plants and C. monilifera. Consequently, in this system there has been little impact of an invasive plant on this plant-bird interaction. The rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits, however, was less in herbicide-treated habitat. This has implications for long-term C. monilifera control, because herbicide treatment often leaves scattered individual plants alive, which would have poorer seed dispersal than plants in dense C. monilifera stands.The removal of C. monilifera affected the bird community, with the overall abundance of birds declining in herbicide-treated areas after the C. monilifera died. Only those birds that consume C. monilifera fruits were affected, while other groups of birds that do not directly use C. monilifera resources were unaffected. Although this impact was minor, it illustrates that removal of an invasive plant can affect bird communities, and these impacts should be considered before control programs are implemented. Dominance of the vegetation by C. monilifera also affected bird communities, with overall bird abundance, specifically that of insectivorous birds, and at some locations nectarivorous birds, being lower in C. monilifera than native habitat. The quantity of remaining native vegetation, particularly of nectar-producing plants widely used by birds, appears to be important in determining bird community composition in invaded areas.In this study, I have demonstrated that both dominance of the vegetation by an invasive plant, and the control of an invasive plant, can induce change in fauna communities, and disrupt some plant-animal interactions. These changes will need to be considered carefully in planning management actions to conserve coastal bird communities and their interactions with plants. While continued efforts to control C. monilifera are clearly justified, these should form part of a broad strategy for coastal community conservation, including consideration of other threats to native communities that act independently or in concert with C. monilifera invasion. These considerations should include the potential impacts of other invasive plant species, targeted sites and species for control efforts, and other forms of habitat loss and degradation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A morphodynamic model of atoll-islet evolution</field><field name="creator">Barry, Stephen J</field><field name="description">A morphodynamic model of atoll-islet evolution, the Sediment Allocation Model (SAM), was developed based on the assumption that islets are equilibrium landforms. The assumption that islets are equilibrium landforms implies that the volume of sediment sequestered in an islet reaches stability when considered over the time-scale of islet evolution. Stability of the islet implies that the maximum volume of an islet (accommodation) can be quantified. Morphodynamic feedback between the islet and sediment transport processes is manifest in the rate of sediment sequestration by the islet. Initial increase of islet volume is rapid, sediment sequestration slows as islet volume increases, and stops when accommodation is full. The rate of islet development is constrained by antecedent morphology, sediment supply, and sediment transport. The constraints and accommodation for islet evolution are difficult to measure directly. Estimates of the accommodation, sediment supply, the effect of antecedent morphology, and the morphodynamic feedback between islet volume and sediment sequestration are generated using measurements of islet volume in an inversion algorithm. Experimentation carried out using a hypothetical test-case indicated that errors in the measurements of islet volume used in the inversion algorithm would result in a damping of the morphodynamic feedback and overestimation of both sediment supply and accommodation. The SAM was implemented using published radiocarbon-dated samples for surveyed islets transects. A data-model template was developed to incorporate the published data into the SAM. In the data-model template an atoll-islet was represented by a xvii combination of morphological sub-units with sub-unit sequestration dominated by either lagoon processes or ocean processes. The input to the SAM was a series of sediment volumes representing islet evolution. Sediment volumes were calculated using isochron patterns that represent a hybrid of lateral accretion and vertical accretion, recognized modes of sediment accumulation on atoll-islets. Sediment volume measurements calculated using the hybrid-accretion patterns were consistent with the assumption of morphodynamic feedback between islet morphology and sediment accretion processes. Comparative metrics are required to test and refine models of islet evolution, however, suitable comparative data are not currently available. The hybrid-accretion pattern of islet evolution formed the basis for the development of a metric to determine islet location on the reef platform. Islet location was measured on four atolls as the distance from the reef crest to the oceanward beach-toe. The results of the measurement procedure were evaluated in the context of three factors that influence islet evolution: energy-exposure, sediment supply, and antecedent morphology. The results indicate that the distance from the reef crest to the oceanward beach-toe is a measurable response to the influence of the three factors.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming perceptions of Islamic culture in Australia through collaboration in contemporary art</field><field name="creator">Tzavaras, Annette</field><field name="description">My creative work investigates the negative space, the &#8216;in between space&#8217; that leads to new knowledge about other artists and other cultures.

The baseline for this research involved the secondary data published by ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and TIO (Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman) involving ISP numbers, Internet issues/complaints data. As many relatively new services are being offered, ISPs are finding it difficult to cope with varying customer expectations and their future technology expectancy. Access to infrastructure, avoiding anti&#8212;competitive behaviour from large players and service differentiation has become more important than ever for their survival. A number of challenges such as lack of provision of good quality service, lack of ability to cope with increasing (or varying) customer demands and expectations and lack of flexibility in providing services need to be overcome. The service environment in networking has focused heavily on the technical side and very little attention has been given to functional variables such as complaints handling, aligning technical and functional service quality processes and effective service recovery during service failures. Relying fully on the technical side obscures the nature of service. This research identified the fact that end users&#8217; perspective of quality of services need to consider not only the inherent quality of the network, but also the service quality provided by the ISP. Users perceive poor service quality provided by their ISP if they do not get help desk support required from using the ISP services. This can turn a complaint about a problem in to a complaint about the company.  The research question is answered by this thesis &#8220;What is it that the use of discrete event simulation technique can contribute to the understanding and managing service quality data for different ISP service operations?&#8221;The research methodology chosen was discrete event simulation methodology. The discrete event technique involves building up models based on the dynamic behavior of a network system as the time progresses. The appropriateness and effectiveness of this technique was tested by modelling technical service elements (modelling policy based networks using differentiated service schemes, alarm based network management system for effective service level agreement monitoring) and key functional elements that determine ISP non-technical service performance (ISP complaints handling, ISP call centre performance variables). The scenarios led to the development of an integrative simulation framework that addresses both user level service quality issues and network system oriented service quality issues. In the past user level service quality issues have been provided with negligible importance. The framework developed can help ISPs to model service attributes and use the results from such simulation studies to make competitive marketing decisions. The issues raised before and after simulation can be compared for effective service design. To achieve service excellence ISPs have to understand the interrelationship between various service quality dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy and how these dimensions affect customer perception of ISP service quality. In conclusion the research found that discrete event simulation can be used to understand and manage service quality data by internet service providers involving different ISP service operations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimising attainment deficit: a grounded theory of the leadership process in a large, public sector bureaucracy</field><field name="creator">Kriflik, George</field><field name="description">This thesis explains the concept of Minimising Attainment Deficit. This is a leadership process whereby leaders help workers fulfil their expectations of achieving their potential in their work. The purpose of the research was to generate a theory of the leadership process within a large, slow change, public sector, engineering bureaucracy. The aims were to discover the main concern of workers and to explain the leadership processes that resolved this main concern. The substantive processual theory of minimising attainment deficit has been presented as the basic social process which resolves the main concern of workers wishing to minimise the gap between their current work reality and that level which they perceive themselves to be capable of attaining. A qualitative approach to the collection and analysis of data was adopted through the use of orthodox grounded theory. Its aim was to generate rather than to test theory. This research has contributed knowledge relevant to practitioners in the substantive area by identifying the main concerns of participants and the process by which these concerns can be resolved. It has also identified opportunities for further research that may significantly progress the continually evolving understanding of the leadership process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent knowledge acquisition using case-based reasoning: knowledge sharing and reuse</field><field name="creator">Kang, Seung Hwan</field><field name="description">This research aims to investigate the feasibility of using techniques in case-based reasoning for the knowledge acquisition phase in the development of knowledge management systems to allow knowledge sharing and reuse.

The application of case-based reasoning techniques allows the knowledge management systems to acquire new knowledge by adopting the knowledge gained in new cases and reusing the old ones in the case repository. This way, it allows old knowledge to be shared and new knowledge to be added in the knowledge repository. This research also proposes an ontology-driven mechanism that provides standardised vocabularies and conceptualisation of knowledge domain. A prototype for a student admission enquiry system is developed on the Semantic Web to demonstrate the application of case-based reasoning cycle so that knowledge sharing and reuse can be achieved autonomously.

A substantial improvement in flux pinning and reduction of anisotropy in uranium doped Bi-2223/Ag tapes has been achieved due to thermal neutron irradiation. However, the radioactivity of the silver sheath is too high for practical application of this technique. This work aimed at minimising the detrimental effects of doping to allow for later irradiation and fission to create columnar defects for strong flux pinning. A number of uranium containing compounds, U[subscript3]O[subscript8], U(Ca,Sr)[subscript2]O[subscript5], and U(Ca,Sr)[subscript3]O[subscript6] have been identified in the U-Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system. These equilibrium compounds have been synthesised and added to Bi-2223/Ag composite tapes in progressively greater amounts. The effects on the transport critical current density of Bi-2223/Ag of doping with a variety of uranium compounds up to 2 at% was determined. The compatibility and interaction between uranium compounds and the Bi-2223 matrix was systematically studied under various thermal processing conditions. Bi-2223/Ag doped with compounds using compositions closer to the equilibrium composition was shown to have superior superconducting properties to that doped with uranium oxide compounds. The effects of chemical degradation by uranium compound dopants via strontium and calcium removal from the Bi-2223 structure have been indirectly determined by critical current density (J[subscriptc]) measurements. Losses in J[subscriptc] can be minimised by stabilising uranium into appropriate compounds. Uca[subscript1.5]Sr[subscript1.5]O[subscript6] shows a remarkable compatibility with Bi-2223 phase, with critical current density reduced by about 15% at a doping level of 1.1 at%, compared with the 85% reduction in critical current density at the same doping level of pure uranium oxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that Uca[subscript1.5]Sr[subscript1.5]O[subscript6] has no effect on Bi-2223 formation, while U[subscript3]O[subcript8] caused degradation of Bi-2223 phase up to 50% at a doping level of 1.1 at%. The uranium compound doping also widens the processing window to 15 [celsius degrees]. Microstructural changes due to doping were investigated. Removal of elements from the Bi-2223 matrix by uranium compound dopants was studied by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that Uca[subscript1.5]Sr[subscript1.5]O[subscript6] least degraded electrical performance and microstructure, as it removed the least elements from the matrix. It would appear that Uca[subscript1.5]Sr[subscript1.5]O[subscript6] most closely approximates an ideal Bi-2223 compatible uranium compound, but it still removes some amount of copper.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface engineering of sheet metal forming dies</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Tamara</field><field name="description">Zinc coated steel is an attractive material for the manufacture of automotive body panels due to its excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. It does however pose problems during sheet metal forming operations due to zinc pick-up on the die surfaces which changes the original forming characteristics of the part and increases maintenance of the die. The hypothesis presented here is that the severity of the problem may be reduced through surface engineering of the critical areas of the die so as to modify the frictional and chemical properties of the die surface. The critical area of the die to be investigated is the drawbead region. Drawbeads are added to deep drawing sheet metal forming dies to control the flow of metal into the die to eliminate wrinkling. The surface engineering involved coating experimental drawbeads with thin, hard coatings of TiN, TiCN and TiC using filtered arc physical vapour deposition. Uncoated Steel drawbeads of varying hardness were also investigated. Frictional forces of the drawbeads were determined using a Drawbead Simulation Test. Zinc pick-up on the drawbeads was assessed through ICP analysis. All results were correlated with hardness, roughness and chemistry of the drawbead surface. Hardening and polishing the surface of the uncoated steel drawbead reduces the average coefficient of friction between the sheet and the bead. Over time however as more sheets are drawn, a steady increase in friction coefficient occurs. Changing the surface chemistry of the drawbead by coating not only reduces the average coefficient of friction but also acts to reduce friction as more sheets are drawn. Thus, the minimisation of zinc pick-up when using galvanneal steel depends on a complex interaction between increasing die surface hardness, decreasing die surface roughness and changing die surface chemistry in the regions of high forming forces (i.e. the drawbead). Thin, hard, smooth ceramic-like coatings of alloy carbides (in particular) and alloy nitrides deposited onto the drawbead section of sheet metal forming dies effectively reduced the coefficient of friction between the die and galvanneal sheet. The reduction in the friction contribution of the forming forces in the drawbead region assists in maintaining forming characteristics of the die and may also assist in reducing the powder/flaking of the zinc-alloy coated sheet. The hardness of the coated drawbead together with the reduced affinity between the carbides and nitrides in the drawbead coating and the Fe in the zinc-alloy coating also reduced the amount of zinc-alloy pick-up.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry of biomolecular complexes</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Rajesh</field><field name="description">Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been used to study the non-covalent interactions in dsDNA-drug complexes, a protein-protein complex of DNA polymerase III of E. coli and binding specificity of cisplatin in the formation of bifunctional adducts with DNA. ESI conditions have been developed to maximise the detection of dsDNA and drug-DNA complexes in the positive ion mode, with comparable and/or superior results to those achieved previously using negative ions. The gas phase stabilities of complexes of dsDNA with different classes of drugs have been examined. Different classes of drugs exhibit differences in sequence selectivity, modify DNA in various ways and are also known to stabilise or destabilise dsDNA. ESI-MS/MS, desolvation temperature variation, and in-source collision-induced dissociation experiments have been employed to examine the relative stabilities of drug-dsDNA complexes. The binding of complexes of a new class of metallointercalators containing Ru with dsDNA has also been examined by ESI-MS. Conditions were developed for optimal detection of these complexes in the negative ion mode and their stoichiometries and sequence selectivity have been probed. The relative order of binding affinities was found to correlate with solution studies carried out with related ruthenium compounds containing the extended planar ligands dpq, dpqC and dppz. ESI-MS has also been used to supply a snapshot of components of mixtures of two proteins (?)186 and (?) that form a complex in DNA polymerase III. The stability of the (?-?)186 complex has been studied under various solution and instrumental conditions. The behaviour of this complex was consistent with significant contribution of hydrophobic interactions to its stability, and contrasted with the previously reported behaviour of the Tus-Ter complex. In addition, ESI-MS experiments suggested that the (?) subunit is involved in stabilisatioin of (?)186. This is consistent with earlier experiments in which (?) was shown to stabilise (?) against thermal inactivation. Finally the thesis has examined binding specificity of cisplatin in the formation of bifunctional adducts at three well-characterised binding sites on ssDNA. A novel method for better reaction conditions and purification of ssDNA-cisplatin adducts HPLC has been developed. The bifunctional ssDNA-cisplatin adducts at 5-GG-3, 5-AG-3 and 5-GA-3 sites have been characterised by enzymatic digestion followed by ESI mass spectrometry for identification of binding sites.

View point dependent theories, on the other hand, do not have a parts-focussed approach and instead propose that objects are represented as a collection of 2D images. However, research on simple 2D objects suggests that configural information may be processed differently to shape information. Thus, the aim of the current thesis was a systematic investigation of how visual object property information is extracted, encoded and utilised. This was achieved by examining how the following types of information are utilised in detecting changes to 3D novel objects: (i) the global configuration of the parts of an object, (ii) the arrangement of those parts, and (iii) the identity or shape of an objects parts. Previous studies or visual object processing have typically employed tasks such as matching tasks, visual search and delayed recognition. The change detection paradigm, in which the objective is to detect changes to objects or scenes, has emerged relatively recently. The rationale behind this paradigm is that the types of changes detected reflect the information that is encoded by the visual system. As such, change detection tasks can be used as an effective tool for further investigating the processing and employment of visual object properties. The data reported in this thesis demonstrates that configural information is important for novel object perception and recognition, more so than the shape or relative arrangement of parts. Specifically, changes to the configuration of an objects parts were detected quicker and more accurately than changes to either the shape or arrangement of an objects parts. This pattern of results was obtained regardless of whether the object was 2D or 3D, whether attention was focussed on the location of the change or was distributed, or whether configural information was defined in terms of categorical or coordinate relations. The configural advantage was found using objects or different size, orientation, and complexity, and was found at all levels of object processing (eg, change detection, across object rotation in depth, and recognition). In conclusion, the current research suggests that perception and recognition of novel objects utilises similar types of object property information. Not only is configural information attended before part shape or relative location, but also, configural information is utilised quickly and accurately over a wide range of tasks. This consistency in the pattern of results suggests that configural information plays an important role in the processing of visual information in general. In particular, global configural information may be encoded quickly and used as a framework for further analysis of detail features such as shape.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solar activity and recent climate change: evaluating the impact of geomagnetic activity on atmospheric circulation</field><field name="creator">Palamara, Daniel</field><field name="description">Solar-climate studies have a long and controversial history and the relevance of solar activity to recent climate change remains unclear. Despite prevalent scepticism and uncertainty, recent developments in both solar and atmospheric sciences warrant the reinvestigation of possible solar-climate relationships. The advent of public access to enormous databases of solar and atmospheric variables encourages the reinvestigation of possible solar-climate relationships, particularly those involving solar-modulated geomagnetic activity variations. If further studies demonstrate that climate change has been influenced by geomagnetic activity then research can progress to predicting, modelling, and quantifying the effect. Conversely, if a geomagnetic-activity influence on climate change can be comprehensively disproved researchers can focus on alternative solar or terrestrial climate explanations. This thesis has evaluated the potential role of solar variability in recent climate change through the statistical examination of the impact of solar-modulated geomagnetic activity on atmospheric circulation. Geomagnetic activity was parameterised using the AA index, while atmospheric circulation was parameterised using the Antarctic, Arctic, and North Atlantic Oscillation indices. These atmospheric circulation indices correspond to the leading causes of variability in the extra-tropical troposphere. Changes in these indices result from large-scale climate changes that are centred on the mid-latitudes. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis sea level pressure data were also used to examine the spatial signature of geomagnetic activity effects at the earths surface. The link between geomagnetic activity and atmospheric circulation was evaluated at daily, annual, and decadal timescales. The analyses were performed on monthly and three-monthly averages of the atmospheric indices to investigate seasonal patterns. The results indicate that geomagnetic forcing of atmospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere is temporally and seasonally restricted. Moreover, it is controlled by a stratospheric phenomenon known as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and it is reliant on the interaction of stratospheric and tropospheric circulation. When the data are restricted to January values after 1965, for years in which the January QBO is eastwards, the correlation coefficient between geomagnetic activity and the Arctic Oscillation is strong (r = 0.85; ? = 0.05). In the southern hemisphere, statistically significant correlations are evident during March (r = 0.39) and are strongest after the early 1960s, though the QBO plays no part in the relationship. For both hemispheres the relationships are evident at annual as well as decadal timescales and are therefore of practical significance. Solar-modulated geomagnetic activity is therefore an important forcing mechanism for recent climate change. Specifically, many of the unexplained aspects of the recent changes in northern hemisphere climate, including the climate regime shift of the early 1960s, can be attributed to the effects of geomagnetic activity in the upper atmosphere. Interannual variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation should no longer be considered as climatic noise, while the strong positive trend and decadal variations evident since the 1960s can be attributed, in part, to solar forcing. The results also have implications for the relevance of atmosphere-ocean coupling to the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations and the importance of solar activity in southern hemisphere atmospheric circulation. Contrary to claims in the literature, the results of this study indicate that geomagnetic activity is not a viable proxy for solar irradiance variations or the solar-cycle length index. Long-term changes in land temperature are not well correlated to geomagnetic activity and the results of superposed epoch analysis indicate that there is no evidence of geomagnetic forcing of the atmosphere at daily timescales. This indicates that there must be a cumulative effect in the mechanism linking geomagnetic activity to atmospheric circulation that is not discernable in daily data. Potential mechanisms, coupling geomagnetic activity variations to the lower atmosphere, were evaluated by examining the spatial signature of geomagnetic activity in NCEP/NCAR reanalysis zonal wind and temperature data and by comparing geomagnetic activity to solar irradiance, stratospheric aerosol, and total-column ozone data. The reanalysis data extend from the surface to the lower stratosphere in both hemispheres and are available for 17 geopotential heights ranging from 1000 hPa to 10 hPa and 2.5(degree) intervals of latitude and longitude. Through a process of elimination, the results indicate that solar-modulated geomagnetic activity is relevant to tropospheric circulation through the coupling of the upper and middle atmospheres, and the subsequent propagation of stratospheric circulation anomalies to the troposphere through planetary wave activity.

The TIFL tertiary curriculum materials were produced by a project which was initiated by the Asian Studies Council, funded by the then Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training, and implemented at the University of New South Wales in 1992-1994. This study is the first research related to the TIFL materials.The TIFL materials are the most wide-ranging and comprehensive instructional materials that have ever been produced for tertiary Indonesian. They are also highly innovative materials for teaching Indonesian at tertiary level because they are designed according to the communicative approach to language teaching (CLT). The available curriculum materials in the past have been based on either the grammar-translation or the audiolingual approach.Communicative competence theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. Canale and Swain&#8217;s adaptation of Hymes&#8217; original formulation of the theory has been accepted as the theoretical base of this study, in which  communicative competence consists of grammatical, sociocultural, discourse and strategic competence, as overlapping and interactive rather than discrete components. The implication for language pedagogy is that teaching communicatively entails the inclusion of skills that were previously not included in language curriculum design. Littlewood&#8217;s identification of four domains of skill that equate to the four components of CC has been accepted in this study as the basis of CLT. These are skill in manipulating the linguistic system, awareness of the social meanings of language forms and ability to choose appropriate ones, an understanding of language forms as a communicative system, and skills and strategies for using language to communicate meanings as effectively as possible in reallife situations. A communicative methodology (CM) has been developed by theoreticians and practitioners to teach these skills which has five unique characteristics that constitute innovations to the repertoire of language pedagogy. These have been identified by Johnson and Johnson as emphasis on sociolinguistic appropriateness, message-focus rather than focus on linguistic correctness, activation of psycholinguistic processes favourable to language acquisition, encouragement of risk-taking rather than  thoroughness and correctness, and free practice techniques to provide opportunities for learners to marshall subskills in holistic combination. Littlewood&#8217;s and Johnson and Johnson&#8217;s criteria have been used as the basis for evaluating the TIFL materials as communicative teaching materials.A critical evaluation of the materials in terms of theory was considered to be insufficient for this study because of two considerations. First, as the design of the TIFL project made no provision for evaluation, this was to be the first and possibly the only investigation of it. Therefore it was thought important to provide a historical record of how the project was conceived and implemented, and in particular how the problems and compromises that eventuated impacted on the final result. Second, as the TIFL materials are for classroom use, it was thought necessary to include observations of how they are actually used in universities and of their effectiveness as communicative curriculum materials in practice. There are thus historical and empirical as well as theoretical aspects to the study.The study has two research questions: (1) Do the TIFL materials embody a coherent application of communicative competence theory and the communicative approach to language teaching? (2) Do the TIFL materials, in use, promote communicative teaching and learning of Indonesian?The research design is case study method. This was chosen because it is a robust and flexible method suited to studies such as this that are exploratory in nature, and in which the phenomenon under investigation is embedded in a real-life situation with many variables that cannot be controlled. A further advantage of case study method is that it allows a variety of different types of data. In addition to the analysis of the TIFL materials in terms of CC theory and the pedagogical practices of CLT, this study includes data from archival materials, interviews with TIFL materials designers and users of the TIFL materials, ie, lecturers and students from eight universities, and classroom observations. The classroom observations include ethnographic observations and observations using the COLT (Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching) observation scheme. ISLPR (International Second Language Proficiency Ratings) assessments were also obtained from students at three universities where the TIFL materials form the basis of the Indonesian curriculum.It is found that the materials do in the main embody a coherent application of CC theory and CLT. The way that they are implemented at the University of NSW, where they were developed, was however found to contain elements such as drilling that are not normal components of CM. There are a number of other findings that are of interest as well. One is that the outcomes in terms of proficiency ratings are very similar in three universities where the TIFL materials are used as the basis of the curriculum. Another is that students learning Indonesian have extremely varied interests and learning preferences, but that the thematic nature of the TIFL materials made them acceptable to learners with a wide variety of interests and learning styles. The implications of these findings are that the TIFL materials are highly suitable as the basis for tertiary Indonesian programs because they produce reliable proficiency outcomes and are well-liked by students.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Indigenous sovereignty-never ceded": sovereignty, nationhood and whiteness in Australia</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Angela M</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the connections between Whiteness, sovereignty, and nationhood in Australia in relation to the issue of Indigenous peoples' sovereignty. The thesis has two basic premises. The first is that, before White people arrived in the 1770s, Indigenous peoples exercised sovereignty over the continent now known as Australia. The second premise is that their sovereignty has never been ceded.  Recognition of Indigenous sovereignty raises fundamental and unresolved questions about the legitimacy of non-Indigenous people's occupation of the continent and claims to sovereignty over it, because these claims are based on the mistaken belief that this place was terra nullius before non-Indigenous people arrived. Accordingly, in this thesis, the issue of legitimacy is central to the analysis of sovereignty and of White responses to assertions of Indigenous sovereignty. The thesis argues that understanding the relationship between Whiteness (understood as the hegemonic norm and thus as the source of power and privilege in Australian society) and dominant conceptualisations of sovereignty and nationhood is central to understanding why issues of sovereignty and legitimacy remain unresolved and substantially unaddressed. The theoretical framework employed draws on recent critical literature on Whiteness and theoretical work on hegemony to critique dominant conceptualisations of sovereignty and the discourses of nationhood on which these conceptualisations are based.The thesis examines the relationship between sovereignty, nationhood, and Whiteness by analysing the ways in which non-Indigenous responses to Indigenous peoples' assertions of their inherent sovereignty are mediated by Whiteness and by dominant conceptualisations of sovereignty and nationhood. Specifically, the thesis examines White responses to the demands for recognition of Indigenous sovereignty that have been made by the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, situated on the lawns outside Canberra's Parliament House, since 1972. The thesis also analyses the High Court of Australia's judgments in Coe v. Commonwealth (1979) and Coe v. Commonwealth and NSW (1993), in which Paul Coe and his sister Isabel sought to have Indigenous peoples' sovereignty recognised by the Australian judicial system. It goes on to examine the Australian government's response to the Barunga Statement, presented to then Prime Minister Hawke in 1988. This statement called on the Australian Parliament to negotiate with Indigenous people a treaty that recognised Indigenous peoples' sovereignty. The thesis further scrutinises White responses to the assertions of Indigenous sovereignty made by the Aboriginal Provisional Government (APG) since 1990 - in particular, it considers responses to the model for the recognition of Indigenous sovereignty that the APG has proposed. Finally, the thesis contains a comparative analysis of sovereignty, nationhood, and Whiteness as it is played out in the treaty-making process currently underway in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC). This comparative analysis demonstrates that, despite the apparent promise of the BC process as a potential alternative to the processes in which Indigenous-non-Indigenous relations are currently framed in Australia, the BC process is more limited and conservative than its proponents suggest.  Subsequently, this analysis shows how the conclusions the thesis draws about the relationship between sovereignty, nationhood, and Whiteness are applicable beyond the Australian context.The thesis reveals that, in White responses to Indigenous peoples' assertions of their sovereignty, there are various tools and strategies that function to marginalise, silence, ignore, and/or make invisible Indigenous people and groups who argue that their inherent sovereignty should be recognised by White people. Consequently, these tools and strategies work to reinforce Whiteness as the hegemonic norm in Australian society and to preserve the White race privilege that hegemonic Whiteness itself maintains. Accordingly, the thesis demonstrates that, if we are to come to terms with the important questions about sovereignty and legitimacy raised by Indigenous peoples' never-ceded sovereignty, we must interrogate and undo White race privilege. In turn, this requires a critique of and challenge to the conceptualisations of sovereignty and nationhood upon which White race privilege depends.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of climate change on Antarctic terrestrial flora</field><field name="creator">Wasley, Jane</field><field name="description">Climate change is expected to affect the high latitudes first and most severely, rendering Antarctica one of the most significant baseline environments for the study of global climate change. The indirect effects of climate warming, including changes to the availability of key environmental resources, such as water and nutrients, are likely to have a greater impact upon Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems than the effects of fluctuations in temperature alone. Water availability is the focus in this thesis for two main reasons; firstly, there is a wealth of evidence to suggest water is currently limiting to Antarctic plant distributions and productivity, and secondly, availability of this key resource is predicted to change with the onset of climate change. Nutrient availability is a second variable considered in this work, as there is evidence to suggest that nutrients also play a role in determining plant species distributions, and changes to nutrient balance and turnover rates are also expected in response to climate change. This work was conducted in the floristically important Windmill Islands region of East Antarctica, with the three Windmill Islands moss species Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Grimmia antarctici forming its focus. A combination of field ecology, ecophysiology and laboratory studies were used to determine fine-scale patterns of present species distributions and their relationship to naturally occurring water and nutrient resource gradients, the impact of increased water and nutrients on a range of cryptogamic communities, and tolerance of desiccation biological profiles. A survey-based approach was used to determine species level patterns in bryophyte species distributions, and identify correlations with resource availability. Ten replicate transects, along community gradients, from pure bryophyte stands, through transitional moribund bryophyte zones, to lichen-dominated communities, were surveyed at two sites. The physical environment at each site was characterised by measurement of site soil properties, along with individual transect aspects and slopes. To determine the relationship between resource gradients and community patterns water and nutrient availability, along with a range of plant biochemistry measures indicative of the growth environment, were measured using a series of quadrats along each transect. Percent abundance for each species and/or vegetation category was determined for each quadrat by microscopic examination of field samples. The community gradient, covering the entire ecological range of past and present bryophyte occupation, was found to be accompanied by resource gradients that operated in opposing directions. Pure bryophyte communities existed under conditions of high water availability and low nutrient availability. Crustose lichen-dominated communities persisted under opposing environmental conditions, of low water availability and high nutrient availability. Grimmia antarctici dominated the wettest habitats but its distribution extended into the dry moribund zones, albeit in low levels of abundance. Bryum pseudotriquetrum occurred in consistent levels of abundance across the entire gradient, whilst C. purpureus was restricted to the driest habitats. Live bryophyte material was found to occur in moribund turf, supporting the potential for bryophyte regeneration under a future wetter climate. Regenerating turf showed potential to support high species diversity, as all four bryophytes survive in this zone. To investigate the likely impacts of a wetter climate on Antarctic terrestrial communities, four cryptogamic communities, pure bryophyte, moribund bryophyte, crustose and fructicose lichen-dominated communities were subject to a multi-season manipulative field experiment. Within each community type, eight replicate quadrats received increased water and/or nutrient availability over two consecutive summer seasons. A range of physiological and biochemical measurements were conducted in order to quantify the community response to the treatments and determine the extent of any nutrient and water limitation. Few multi-season manipulative field experiments have been conducted in continental Antarctica. Whilst an overall increase in productivity in response to water and nutrient additions was supported, productivity appeared to respond more strongly to nutrient additions than to water additions. Pure bryophyte and fructicose lichen communities also showed stronger positive responses to additions, identifying some communities that may be better able to adapt and prosper under the ameliorating conditions associated with a warmer, wetter future climate. Using a range of morphological, biochemical and physiological techniques, biological profiles related to desiccation tolerance were developed for the three bryophyte study species, providing measures of relative abilities to avoid, tolerate, recover from and survive desiccation. Ceratodon purpureus showed good desiccation avoidance characteristics, its photosynthetic efficiency remained high at low water contents and it was lipid rich, suggesting that this species is well adapted to survive a drying climate. Bryum pseudotriquetrum is also likely to survive drier conditions, as this species showed good desiccation avoidance, had a plastic response to desiccation, and contained stachyose, which is likely to assist in its survival of desiccation events. Conversely, G. antarctici showed poor desiccation avoidance, as photosynthetic efficiency required highest water contents and it contained few protective substances, this species is therefore least likely to survive a drying environment. This study provides a baseline from which future changes to the Windmill Islands cryptogamic communities can be monitored. A baseline incorporating fine-scale bryophyte species patterns is particularly useful, as this component of the cryptogamic community is likely to be highly sensitive to even small shifts in water availability and detection of change is likely to be more sensitive at fine- rather than broad-scales. Both water and nutrient resource availability was found to underlie regional bryophyte species distributional patterns. The dynamics of the Windmill Islands flora is therefore likely to shift in response to climate change as the availability of these key resources is altered. Under a wetter future climate, productivity is overall likely to increase but only certain cryptogamic communities are likely to thrive. Regeneration of moribund bryophytes appears likely only if the future moisture regime creates consistently moist conditions. Bryum pseudotriquetrum is most likely to survive both a drying climate and also a fluctuating climate, which is a highly likely scenario for the region. Under a drier climate, the Antarctic endemic, G. antarctici, is likely to be most adversely affected, as it dominates only the wettest communities and generally shows poor tolerance of desiccation. Conservation issues are therefore raised for this species, if the current drying trend continues, creating overall biodiversity concerns.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transfer of manipulation skills from human to machine through demonstration in a haptic rendered virtual environment</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yuxin</field><field name="description">Robots are widely used as automation tools to improve productivity in industry. Force sensitive manipulation is a generic requirement for a large number of industrial tasks, especially those associated with assembly. One of the major factors preventing greater use of robots in assembly tasks to date has been the lack of availability of fast and reliable methods of programming robots to carry out such tasks. Hence robots have in practice been unable to economically replicate the complex force and torque sensitive capability of human operators. A new approach is explored to transfer human manipulation skills to a robotics system. The teaching of the human skills to the machine starts by demonstrating those skills in a haptic-rendered virtual environment. The experience is close to real operation as the forces and torques generated during the interaction of the parts are sensed by the operator. A skill acquisition algorithm utilizes the position and contact force/torque data generated in the virtual environment combined with a priori knowledge about the task to generate the skills required to perform such a task. Such skills are translated into actual robotic trajectories for implementation in real time. The peg-in-hole insertion problem is used as a case study. A haptic rendered 3D virtual model of the peg-in-hole insertion process is developed. The haptic or tactile rendering is provided through a haptic device. A multi-layer method is developed to derive and learn the basic manipulation skills from the virtual manipulation carried out by a human operator. The force and torque data generated through virtual manipulation are used for skill acquisition. The skill acquisition algorithm primarily learns the actions which result in a proper change of contact states. Both optimum sequences and normal operation rules are learned and stored in a skill database. If the contact state is not among or near any state in the optimum sequences stored in the skill database, a corrective strategy is applied until a state among or near a state in the optimal space is produced. On-line incremental learning is also used for new cases encountered during physical manipulation. The approach is fully validated through an experimental rig set up for this purpose and the results are reported.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributing to learning to change: developing an action learning peer support group of professionals to investigate ways of improving their own professional practice</field><field name="creator">Allen, Dianne</field><field name="description">Learning to change is difficult, complex, and takes time. This raises two questions for me: Why is this so? How can such learning to change be facilitated? This study explores the issues involved in learning to change. It undertakes the study from a viewpoint which values having an explanatory conceptual understanding (theory) that will inform action (practice), both for learners seeking to engage with change for their own practice, and for a facilitator of such learning with others. My first focus was on testing the efficacy of a professional development activity. The design for the activity was based on my conception of reflective research of practice, developed from the work of Kenneth Kressel, and what would be involved in developing such an approach to learning about practice, in-practice. My testing involved two processes: (1) exploring whether the professional development activity, when used with two different groups of professionals, encouraged them to engage in such an approach in their own practice; (2) engaging with my own practitioner experience and comparing my theorising about the experience with that reported in the literature. Consequently, I have at least two stories to tell. And I share these stories on the basis of one of my findings: sharing reflective stories prompts reciprocal sharing, and shared reflective thinking may challenge perspectives and perceptions, triggering additional learning. Practitioners, by engaging with these stories and using their own active compare-and-contrast, and their own values, may be stimulated to undertake further thinking about their own practice, and its rationale. From such a process may come ideas for change which they are prepared to try in-practice; or a deeper, firmer understanding of why they value their own approach over this other. Either result tends to revitalise intentional action in-practice. The first story concerns the outcome of conducting the professional development activity design with two groups of professionals: the outcomes of the activity, while not reaching my intended target, indicate the design&#65533;s merit. The second story concerns the change wrought in myself by the conduct of the inquiry: the first focus on testing the efficacy of a professional development activity shifted to the progressive deepening of my understanding of the theories and practice of &#65533; learning to change, for an adult learner &#65533; inquiry, especially inquiry into practice issues, in-practice &#65533; evaluation, by beginning to enunciate how, and on what basis I was evaluating, and &#65533; the nature of the relationship between learning, inquiry, and evaluation that constitutes much of intentional action in-practice: its intricate interactivity. In developing my understanding of theory and practice, I draw on the work of scholar-practitioners who have a longstanding engagement with the field, including Argyris, Bateson, Heron, Mezirow and Sch&#65533;n. I conclude that reflective research of practice, or self-study of practice for improvement of practice, can be enhanced. Tools that enhance it include: (1) developing self-awareness; (2) developing reflective work to move progressively into the subtle and the contextual elements of practice; and where possible (3) engaging in this enterprise with a group of peers in a collaborative or cooperative context (4) where participants are focused on taking intentional action developed from inquiry into the thinking-action complex of in-practice activities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research as a professional development model for the teaching of writing in early stage one/stage one classrooms</field><field name="creator">Kervin, Lisa K</field><field name="description">The literature addressing the professional development of teachers is abundant, presenting many different components of what constitutes successful professional development. An investigation of the literature suggests that the overwhelming tendency has been to provide professional development opportunities for teachers external to their classroom and school setting, and frequently neglecting to consider the individual teachers professional needs. The purpose of this inquiry was to investigate how the various components of successful professional development could be used to support the professional development of teachers as they focused on their teaching of writing within their own classrooms. Specifically, it sought to explore: Action Research as a Professional Development Model for the teaching of writing in Early Stage One/Stage One classrooms. The way writing has been taught within the inquiry school over the past ten years was investigated, as was the previous professional development experiences of each of the six participant teachers. The principles of the action research process (Kemmins and McTaggart, 1988:11) were used to frame the professional development opportunities provided for each participant teacher in their classroom. The nature of the relationship between each teachers professional development experiences and their professional growth were explored. Throughout this process the teachers engaged with the researcher through semi-structured interviews and reflective journal entries. The researcher compiled field notes from classroom visits to support such data. In response to Pattons (1982, 1990) call for methodological appropriateness several research methodologies have been drawn upon in the design of this inquiry. Ethnographic principles (Merriam, 1998; Bogdan and Biklen, 1992; Van Manen, 1990) were used when investigating the current practices of the school with regard to the teaching of writing. A case study research design (Sturman, 1999; Burns, 1998; Stake, 1995; Guba and Lincoln, 1981) was employed for each of the six participant teacher case studies, which allowed for contextually embedded analysis employing multiple methods. One such method was Narrative Inquiry which involved transforming the collected data into field texts which then allowed the individual teacher narratives to be told (Connelly and Clandinin, 1998, 1990). The constant data analysis not only informed the research focus but also continued to guide the ongoing professional development experiences. The grounded theory that emerged from the inquiry identified key components of a successful in-school professional development experience. These components are mutually inclusive. The importance of the school professional culture was found to be critical, along with the components of time, relationships, the location for professional development, external influences and the need for an in-school facilitator. The grounded theory also highlighted the importance of focusing firstly on practice before pedagogy. In the beginning the teachers needed outside support as they focused on their practice: the what of teaching writing. Once participants felt more in control of their immediate situation they then presented the need to focus on pedagogy: the how of teaching writing. The teachers all responded to having someone work with them in their classrooms on their individual professional needs through purposeful interactions. The relationships between those involved in the experience moved from mentoring to coaching. Whilst each of the participant teachers worked with the researcher at an individual mentoring level within their classroom, eventually a community of learners emerged amongst the teachers within their grade groupings as they expanded their employment of personal tools and network for professional coaching, dialogue and support.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of a supportive context for distributed learning: a case study of the implementation of a new degree</field><field name="creator">Lefoe, Geraldine</field><field name="description">In 2000, the University of Wollongong opened a new campus and two education access centres on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The Faculty of Arts implemented a new degree, the Bachelor of Arts (Community and Environment), as part of this initiative and the first year of implementation of this new degree is the focus of the study. The purpose of the study was to inform policy and practice at the University of Wollongong and to contribute to the small body of research in the area. A qualitative case study approach was used to investigate the experience of teaching and learning in this context. The broad research question was: What are the characteristics that could constitute guiding principles and strategies for a supportive context for distributed learning? There were two sub-questions for the study: (1) What were the perceptions of the students, tutors, and subject coordinators in the Bachelor of Arts (BA) program of teaching and learning in a distributed learning context? (2) What organisational factors promoted or constrained teaching and learning for students and staff in a distributed learning context? Data was collected through observations, interviews, focus groups and subject surveys, and from records and documents of the institution. Data analysis involved determining the themes, which the researcher interpreted to determine the lessons learned and to make recommendations for policy and practice. The study indicated that the distributed learning context is affected not only by the local implementation of teaching and learning, but also by the context of the wider university. The study revealed the need for an institutional response to the distributed learning context with documented procedures and policy developments to reflect the changing needs of the staff and students. In addition, the increased workload of academic staff implementing such initiatives needs to be acknowledged and rewarded through these changes. The study provides recommendations to improve the implementation process during subsequent years to ensure the sustainability of the initiative. In addition, a preliminary framework has been developed to identify the characteristics of a supportive context for distributed learning. The study may also have relevance to other institutions embarking on similar ventures, and areas for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competitive industry policy for economic development in Sri Lanka: lessons from East Asia</field><field name="creator">Agalewatte, Tikiri Bandara</field><field name="description">This study evaluates the current position of Sri Lanka in terms of Newly Industrialized Country (NIC) status, and explores the lessons which it can learn from the successful East Asian economies. Accordingly, it develops a policy strategy to enable Sri Lanka to converge into a more dynamic growth path leading towards the NIC status in the foreseeable future. This exercise was deemed useful because Sri Lanka had a superior position over many less developed countries (LDCs) including the East Asian NICs four decades ago, but having attempted various economic policy regimes over this period, it still remains a LDC. The study undertook a lengthy literature review of various economic policy regimes which can be used to achieve economic development. East Asian NICs are distinguished by their use of competitive industry policy (CIP)- a mixture of trade policy and industry policy. To examine the relation between CIP and economic development, two case studies were carried out on Taiwan and South Korea. While different processes and policy timing occurred in these countries, both emphasized the importance of outward orientation in their economic activities. Their experience is distinguished by the flexibility, coherence, and consistence of policy making with the state undertaking a role of a developmental state. The study considered the importance of identifying the key elements of their policy approach and the institutional context in which those elements have interacted when learning from their experience. Based on the literature review and the two country studies, the study developed an analytical framework highlighting a growth path to the NIC status. Under the framework, two types of economic policies were identified as useful for rapid growth: trade policy, and industry policy. It also emphasized two necessary conditions for its success: macroeconomic stability; and a developmental state. A statistical test was used to examine how the two types of policies have worked in Sri Lanka after the 1977 reforms. It was found that Sri Lanka has not used appropriate competitive industry policy measures as did by the East Asian NICs in the past. This was followed by a detailed analysis of Sri Lankas policy during the period after 1977. The study compared Sri Lankas post-1977 policy performance with those of South Korea and Taiwan in detail. The main thrust of the rapid industrialization and growth in these countries was identified as originating from the CIP strategy they used. Their superiority over other LDCs including Sri Lanka was attributed to the way they used policies such as sector targeting, directed credit, foreign investment, export processing zones, infrastructure development, human resource development, and R&amp;D along with trade reforms. It was noted that Sri Lanka has shown some progress in implementing more or less similar policies, yet there is still an unfinished agenda for it to reach their level of achievement. The study identified the areas where Sri Lanka needs improvements to achieve the NIC status. First, it discussed a course of actions in order to create a developmental state and a stable macroeconomic environment. Secondly, it identified a few key industries to be targeted by using CIP measures such as credit allocation, FDI, R&amp;D, and EPZs for rapid industrialization and growth. Other CIP measures such as human resource development, infrastructure development, trade and exchange rate policies can also be used to improve resource allocation in all sectors in the economy including the specific industries selected. It is assumed that the targeted industries would generate competitive advantage within a short period of time and, thereby, enhance economic growth though increased exports. While previous studies have examined the applicability of the East Asian model for other LDCs, few have attempted to assess its relevance to Sri Lanka. Besides filling a gap in the trade and industry policy literature, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development approach whereby Sri Lanka can become a NIC. It believes that given Sri Lanka&#65533;s superior position in terms of human development indicators compared to other LDCs, Sri Lanka is in a better position to become a NIC than many other LDCs in the foreseeable future.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of energy utilities based on depreciated optimised replacement cost (DORC), valuation of assets</field><field name="creator">Spence, Cecilia</field><field name="description">This study was prompted by the 1988 introduction by the Commonwealth Government, and later on by both Federal and State regulators, of a philosophy of wanting to achieve a target rate of return within the public sector to emulate private sector efficiency. At the core of the reforms was the adoption of replacement values for assets. This resulted in inflated prices to the users of public services and regulated monopoly assets such as energy utilities, while asset owners enjoyed windfall gains. In developing a form of regulation for natural monopolies the regulators initially looked to Accounting. However Finance Economics provided a structure called the Building Block approach to regulation that had at its center the notion of Depreciated Optimised Replacement Cost (DORC). Capture by Finance Economics, has meant that regulation has developed under the rules of Net Present Value based on the DORC value for assets. Net Present Value calculations are based on the timing and amounts of future cash transactions. This is the meat of regulation. The regulators have addressed the problem of circularity by developing a notion of Optimised Replacement Cost (ORC), and calling on the notion of Tobins Q to transform ORC to ORC used, or DORC. Deprival Value has been endorsed as a valuation principle by the Council Of Australian Governments; however Deprival Value conflicts with DORC in the valuation of sunk assets. This research has critically examined the regulators use of DORC and its inherent circularity and finds that DORC is a flawed concept. It is argued that actual or previously agreed values for assets would produce a better regulatory outcome and fairer prices for consumers. The International Financial Reporting Standards contain in their 2003 Framework notions of Fair Value and Capital Maintenance that address the aims of the regulators and are compatible with Deprival Value. Audited financial reports based on the regulators approved asset valuations and prepared in accordance with International Standards would provide cohesion between regulatory decisions and the financial results of natural monopoly companies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade liberalisation and manufacturing performance in Thailand 1990-2000</field><field name="creator">Phan, Phalla</field><field name="description">Thailand initiated trade liberalisation in the early 1970s by reducing import restrictions. These liberalisations were not consistently implemented because the government used tariffs to correct trade deficit and impose fiscal constraint. However, the breakthrough in liberalisation came in the early 1990s, as the government was under pressure from both external factors, such as participation in WTO, AFTA and APEC, and internal factors, such as demands to promote competitiveness and efficiency of the manufacturing sector. The tariff rates of many products were reduced significantly, and both nominal and effective rates of protection began to decline for the first time. The major objective of this thesis is to study the impacts of trade liberalisation in the 1990s on manufacturing performance in Thailand. The main hypothesis is that trade liberalisation has had positive impacts on the Thai manufacturing sector. To test this hypothesis, sub-hypotheses were formed and appropriate methodologies adopted to enable research at both industry and firm levels. For the industry level study, a number of performance variables were identified, namely, total factor productivity growth, labour productivity growth, change in price-cost margins and export growth. Two periods were selected, 1990 to 1994 and 1990 to 1999. Use of the short period, 1990 to 1994, allowed capture of the immediate impacts of trade liberalisation, while use of the longer period, 1990 to 1999, allowed capture of long-term impacts. The performance variables were regressed with trade policy variables and other control variables, such as structural characteristics and technological characteristics that influence performance. The Ordinary Least Squares was used. The result of the study shows that reduction in protection rates increased productivity growth and reduced price-cost margins. Output and export growth were also found to be important determinants of productivity growth. Impacts of trade liberalisation on manufacturing performance at the firm level were studied for three reasons: (1) to complement the industry level analysis; (2) to show performance after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-8; and (3) to study the impact of liberalisation at a disaggregated level. Two manufacturing performance indicators were identified at the firm level, technical efficiency and price-cost margins. Technical efficiency was estimated by using stochastic frontier production function. One-year data of about 3005 firms in ten different industries is used in this estimation. Technical efficiency was then regressed with trade and other control variables. The results show that firms in the majority of industries have performed fairly well as the levels of technical efficiency were around 70 and 80 per cent. The results further reveal that the share of foreign investment, exported output and imported input positively influenced firms&#65533; technical efficiencies. The price-cost margins variable at the firm level was regressed with the import penetration ratio, market share, capital labour ratio and concentration ratio. Standard Least Squares and pooled data from 1998, 1999 and 2000 were used. The result reveals that capital intensity and the import penetration ratio were the most important determinants of price-cost margins. Overall, support for the hypothesis that trade liberalisation in the early 1990s has had positive impacts on the manufacturing sector in Thailand has been obtained.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of vortex dynamics of (T1,Pb)(Sr,Ba)2Ca2Cu3Oy and an alternative method for determination of the lock-in angle in twinned superconductors</field><field name="creator">Keshavarzi, Shokat</field><field name="description">Magnetic moment measurements performed on a single crystal sample of (Tl,Pb)(Sr,Ba)[subscript 2]Ca[subscript 2]Cu[subscript 3]Oy reveal an increase in magnetic moment at intermediate and high fields over a wide temperature range below H[subscript c2] Magnetic hysteresis (m-H) loops were taken at different constant temperatures using either a MPMS-5T SQUID magnetometer or a PPMS-9T magnetometer and within the temperature range 0.1 &lt; T/Tc &lt; 0.85. The main objective of this thesis was to study the mechanisms involved in the emergence of the peak in the magnetic hysteresis loops in the two samples (the so-called peak effect). It is argued that point disorder in the form of oxygen vacancies or substitution is responsible for pinning at intermediate and high field. Vortex dynamics at fields below and above the peak in hysteresis loops for the sample are shown to be well explained by a quasi-lattice Bragg Glass state and elastic Collective and Plastic Vortex Creep, respectively. For this purpose, relaxation in magnetic moment was measured at different fields and temperatures. Following that, the field and temperature dependence of the normalized relaxation rate, S, the effective activation energy, U, and the critical exponent were calculated. Analysis of all these quantities in the material led to the conclusion that the transition from a highly ordered vortex lattice (Abrikosov lattice) to an amorphous vortex lattice is responsible for the rise in magnetic moment at low fields, and subsequently the crossover from this amorphous state to a plastically deformed vortex lattice, which is assisted by dislocations, is responsible for the suppression of the peak effect in m-H loops. The investigation of flux pinning by twin planes has attracted considerable attention, since naturally-formed twin planes occur regularly in Y123 crystals. One of the characteristic properties of vortex pinning by twin planes is a cusp-like dependence of the irreversibility field (H[subscript irr]) on the angle (?) between the twin plane and the magnetic field. The cusp appears around (?) = (?), within the angular range (?). The angle (?) is called the lock-in angle. The measurement of the angular dependence of H[subscript irr] has been the principal method used to study the locking of magnetic vortices by twin planes and the determination of (?). However, due to the high irreversibility field of 123 systems, such measurements could be conducted only at high temperatures, close to T[subscript c], at which the irreversibility field is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, H [subscript irr] is defined by an arbitrary value of magnetization, at which the ascending and descending branches of the magnetic hysteresis loop, or the zero-field cooled and field-cooled branches of the temperature dependence of the magnetization, are seen to merge. Because of this, it is highly desirable to develop an alternative method for obtaining (?), which relies on universal physical principles instead of arbitrary definitions. Such a method is presented in this work. This method was developed for an off-stoichiometric Sm123 single crystal. Due to the global behaviour of the hysteresis loop at high temperatures close to T[subscript c] for twinned superconductors this method is not restricted to this compound and can be used for all twinned superconductors irrespective of their microstructures or oxygen contents. This method for determining the lock-in angle (?) for pinning of the vortices on extended defects, i.e. twin planes here, was employed without any pre-assumed criterion for defining (?). Appropriate scaling of the hysteresis loops for different angles close to the c-axis led to a clear discrimination between the two vortex dynamics regimes. From this scaling the lock-in angle was determined to be 6 degrees &#65533; 0.1 degrees, which means that the uncertainty in determining the lock-in angle using this method is considerably less than with other existing methods.[Note: this abtract contained scientific formulae that would not come across onthis form.

It consists of dealing with a number of different factors, such as the number of lectures, subjects, classrooms, working time slots, and various other constraints. The problem consists of a set of subjects to be scheduled in timeslots, a set of rooms in which time can take place, a set of students who attend the subjects, and a set of subjects satisfied by rooms and required by timeslots. The heart of the problem is the constraints that exist as regulations within each resource and between resources. The problem exhibits the unwelcome nature of combinatorial explosion. There are various solution approaches to solve the timetabling problem. This research applies constraint satisfaction programming approach to address the problem. Constraint satisfaction programming is a paradigm in Artificial Intelligence, which has been used successfully to solve many scheduling problems. Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is defined by a set of variables, a domain of values for each variable, and a set of constraints between each pair of variables. A solution of a CSP is a consistent assignment of all variables to values in such a way that all the constraints are satisfied. Backtracking with arc consistency is the basic of the search algorithm for applying constraint propagation. Strategies of variable and value ordering play an important role in solution efficiency. This research focuses on developing a CSP model for a university timetabling problem. A sample case study problem is investigated and a constraint satisfaction programming approach is implemented using ILOG Scheduler and ILOG Solver. We have used various goals in ILOG to investigate the performance of the CSP approach. Our results have shown that enforcing tight constraint level and ranking the constraints by positioning the constraints at the beginning of the activities can lead to better result.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journalism at risk: Factors influencing journalistic coverage of the GM food and crops debate (Australia, 1999-2001) and prospects for critical journalism</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Anna</field><field name="description">This thesis examines factors shaping journalistic coverage of risk debates involving new technologies, using the Australian debate over genetically modified/manipulated (GM) food and crops during the period 1999-2001. It argues for a more thorough application of constructivism in risk journalism scholarship, and a more sophisticated application of the conflict frame in risk journalism practice. Theoretical tools for analysing risk journalism are developed from empirical research and a broad range of literatures. Prospects for one particular type of critical risk journalism, which is based on insights from science and technology studies (STS), are explored. The thesis first documents the forceful communication effort by institutional proponents of GM, which tends to foreclose debate over the problem of unforeseen consequences arising from the technology. It argues journalism, which challenges such powerful interests, is central to democratic debate over the risks and benefits of new technologies. The thesis explores opportunities for, and barriers to, such a journalism by drawing on interviews probing the beliefs, values, experience and output of 11 Australian journalists, textual analyses and other scholarship on science, society and journalism (with a focus on science, risk and uncertainty). The practice and theory of risk journalism is organised into two ideal types. One plays down the significance of unforeseen consequences of technological innovations and promotes the dominant institutional response to risk. This ideal type of journalism relies on positivist approaches to knowledge and scientific consensus. By contrast, the other ideal type, which challenges the dominant institutional response to risk, relies on constructivist approaches to knowledge and journalistic notions of conflict and criticism embedded in the professional ideal of the fourth estate. The practices of the journalists interviewed demonstrate various combinations of features from the two ideal types and are better represented by four modes of journalism. The thesis evaluates existing approaches to constructivist risk journalism scholarship and calls for the development of an STS-informed critical risk journalism that frames risk debates as being about competing responses to uncertainty. A resonance between professional ideals of objectivity in both science and journalism is found to be a key barrier to this mode of journalism.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keeping one step ahead: tandem, an assessment and intervention programme for parents of adolescents at risk of problem behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Stoyles, Gerard J</field><field name="description">This research emerged from a recognised need arising from other research literature as well as clinical practice to identify and intervene with adolescent problem behaviour at its earliest stages. Working with parents as co-facilitators with the clinician was acknowledged as being the primary means of motivating and supporting adolescents to alter behavioural patterns that if left unattended would most likely lead to complications of a legal and self-harming nature. The importance of looking to parents as the main focus of intervention recognised both the major influence of parents in the life of the adolescent and the underlying prerequisite of a warm, supportive, and hence protective family environment to promote adaptive adolescent development. These essential aspects gave rise to the TANDEM programme, with &#8220;The Family Check-Up&#8221; (Dishion, Kavanagh &amp; Kiesner, 1999) providing the developmental model. As the focus of this research, this programme aimed to ameliorate dysfunctional adolescent behaviour through clear identification of harmful risk-behaviour, the involvement of the parent in this assessment process, and the supportive development of appropriate skills and self-attributes within the parent as a means of reducing problem adolescent behaviour and an improved parent-adolescent relationship. The principal theoretical orientation of this research was cognitive-behavioural. At the outset, an assessment instrument was developed to identify harmful adolescent risk-behaviour. This development also served to identify domains that reflected normal adolescent risk-behaviour. The development of the assessment instrument commenced with a preliminary investigation of adolescent behavioural patterns. Data for the preliminary investigation was obtained from a metropolitan sample of male and female adolescent high school students (n = 187) ranging in age from 12 to 17 years (M = 14.53 years, SD = 0.50 years). A factor analysis of this data suggested the ongoing development of this assessment instrument. Findings from the preliminary investigation led to the initial instrument being restructured prior to its further administration. A parent version was also developed for this second research phase. The final shape of the assessment instrument included a revised format of the original questionnaire used in the preliminary investigation, together with the inclusion of additional questionnaires. These additional questionnaires investigated the adolescent&#8217;s use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, and the adolescent&#8217;s self-perception of future harmful risk. A questionnaire investigating parental resilience was included in the parent version only. The final format of both versions of the instrument was entitled the Adolescent Problem Behaviour Assessment (APBA). The APBA was administered to a metropolitan high school sample of adolescents (n = 410), ranging in age from 12 years to 16 years 9 months (M = 14.32 years, SD = 1.31 years). Two hundred and one students were male and 209 students were female. Apart from 14 males, the APBA was also administered to the parents of these students. Four hundred and eighty five parents responded (60.9% of the total parent sample), including 282 mothers and 203 fathers. Apart from responses to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use, factor analyses were conducted in order to identify principal factors within each questionnaire of the APBA. Of particular note was the emergence of three factors that identified proneness towards problem behaviour in adolescence. These factors were entitled Peer Modelling, Parent/Family relationships, and Parental Monitoring/Limit Setting, and resembled the three factors describing adolescent behaviour resulting from the factor analysis of data from the preliminary investigation. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) was also conducted with adolescent data to determine the capacity of the APBA to classify adolescents&#8217; behaviour along a continuum of risk. Due to inconsistencies in parent data, the final parent version of the APBA was configured from the adolescent version. The implementation of the TANDEM programme for this research followed the development of the APBA. The running of this programme followed a linear process of adolescent risk assessment, feedback and discussion of assessment results, and the offer of a place in the six-week parenting course as a means of intervention. Parents were centrally involved at every point of this process. The APBA provided the principal means of risk assessment. Three further questionnaires were included with the parent version of the APBA as measures of parenting skill, perceived self-efficacy, and aspects of the family environments of participating parents. Parents and willing adolescents completed the APBA during the intake phase of the TANDEM programme. Sixteen mothers (M = 42.20 years of age, SD = 5.74 years) and 6 fathers (M = 43.29 years of age, SD = 10.40 years), together with 19 adolescents, completed the APBA and the commencement of the programme. Adolescent age and gender was not taken into account due to the small sample size. Measures of parents&#8217; depression, anxiety, and stress were also taken during the intake phase. During the intake phase, parents were also invited to describe the current quality of the home environment and parent adolescent relationship, as well as their chosen strategies for dealing with adolescent problems. Statistically significant differences were found for all assessment domains between the normative and TANDEM adolescent and parent samples, resulting in the total sample of 22 parents being offered a place in the TANDEM-parenting course. All parents accepted this offer and completed the parenting course. The researcher, drawing upon relevant research literature, qualitative data from a small normative parent sample, and prior clinical experience, also developed a 147- page parent manual for use by parents throughout the course. Due to the researcher&#8217;s familiarity with the manual contents, a presenter&#8217;s manual was not developed, with the manual itself being used by the researcher as a guide to presentation. Measures of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as measures of parent resilience, parenting skill, and self-perceived efficacy were taken once more at the conclusion of the parenting course, thus providing pre and post measures of intervention effectiveness. Apart from the latter three questionnaires contained in the APBA, the complete APBA was not administered again since notable positive shifts in adolescent problem behaviour were not anticipated over the relatively short six-week duration of the parenting course. Following the removal of one outlier, statistical analyses of remaining data indicated marginal improvements in resilience, and notable improvements in skill competency and self-efficacy. Parents&#8217; comments at the conclusion of the course supported these findings. In particular, parents reported noteworthy progress in relationships with their adolescents and partners, and a personally enhanced sense of well-being. Two booster sessions were provided, scheduled at four-weekly intervals. However, due to parents&#8217; requests, data was not obtained at these sessions. Alternative arrangements for gaining this data from future booster sessions have been considered. Strengths and weaknesses evident from this research in the TANDEM programme, together with directions for future research, have been discussed in the concluding chapter. The TANDEM programme was found to be a simple, affordable, readily adaptable, and effective means of identifying and ameliorating adolescent problem behaviour. Placing an essentially central focus on the parent in this process enabled the parent to become a successful role model and beneficially therapeutic source for the troubled adolescent. Parents who have participated in this and other TANDEM programmes have described the experience as providing them with a valuable means of supporting the difficulties of their adolescents. As a result, parents have been able to reestablish fundamentally protective family environments and more robust relationships with their adolescent son or daughter.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pointy shoes and pith helmets: dress and identity construction in Ambon from 1850 to 1942</field><field name="creator">Hulsbosch, Marianne</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores identity construction through an analysis of clothing during the last century of Dutch colonial rule in the central Moluccan islands of Indonesia. It addresses a gap in knowledge about dress and adornment in the main island of Ambon. This interdisciplinary investigation crosses sociocultural studies and history. It outlines the presence of Europeans in the eastern corner of the Indonesian archipelago since the sixteenth century when they secured trading routes of the fabled spices nutmeg, pepper and mace. Initially the Portuguese, and during the seventeenth century the Dutch, managed to establish a monopoly on the growing and purchase of cloves. The central Moluccan islands, and in particular Ambon, became one of the main trading posts. Thanks to the longstanding involvement of the Dutch East India trading company (VOC) and the Dutch government there is an exceptionally large amount of resources such as government documentation and reports, photographs, ethnographic and scientific information available for researching the life in the central Moluccan islands. However, sustained investigation into material culture and outward expression is notably absent.The Ambonese people occupied a special place in Dutch colonial times, and their unique social, political and religious position was registered on their bodies through specific items of clothing and dress combinations. Western superiority over local Ambonese was emphasised through technological advancement, religious sobriety, social sophistication, economic dominance and superior technologies of dress and body maintenance. This enforced a visual separation in appearance between the Ambonese and Europeans. Colonialism fostered a strong desire among indigenous Ambonese to nurture ethnic ideals of identity and in doing so both Ambonese and colonists continuously redefined position and class through clothing and adornment.This research describes unique items of clothing and their particular usage that clearly indicated membership of various layers of indigenous, ethnic Christian and ethnic Muslim Ambonese society, as well as social order within Dutch colonial culture.In this research I argue that the identity of the colonised and the coloniser was mediated by embodied social and cultural experiences. Intricate fashions of dress emphasised the relationship that links the body with the dynamic interplay of various power structures in, and between, dominant and subordinate colonial societies. Contemporary thought has shown how bodies are socially constituted and situated in culture. In contrast to Foucauldian concepts of societal response I argue that identity formation via dress practice is an interactive social construction that helps shape society. Drawing on the work of Entwistle (2000) and Wilson (1985) who argue for dress as a &#8216;situated embodied practice&#8217;&#8218; I use Arthur Frank&#8217;s &#8216;Typology of Body Use in Action&#8217; model (Frank 1991:54) as a conceptual framework to facilitate my approach. I demonstrate how this model provides an analytical theory as a basis of sociocultural enquiry into dress experience (embodiment) and intent (usage) in the context of space and time in order to define material identity construction in a colonial milieu.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics and ecology of two rare grevillea species</field><field name="creator">Llorens, Tanya M</field><field name="description">Small and isolated plant populations have a higher probability of extinction &#8211; they are more susceptible to a range of environmental, demographic and genetic processes that may reduce population viability. In recent times, the number of populations and species that are susceptible to these processes has increased as a result of world-wide, human-induced habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation typically reduces the formerly more continuous natural distribution of a species to a series of smaller and more isolated populations that occur in smaller and more isolated habitat patches. Such populations are often exposed to a range of additional processes that may threaten their viability, such as changes to disturbance regimes, environmental conditions and interactions with other species. However, our current understanding of the complex effects and interactions of these processes is poor. Species responses vary widely, studies are biased towards trees, herbs and self-incompatible species, and most studies investigate only one or two processes that may affect viability. Consequently, we are unable to make accurate predictions about the likely impacts of habitat fragmentation on population and species viability. I tested several hypotheses about the impact of habitat fragmentation, small population size, and population isolation on populations of two Grevillea species (Proteaceae) that occur in the Sydney region of New South Wales, Australia. These species provided an opportunity to investigate some of the ecological and genetic consequences of small population size and isolation, and to contrast them between a species for which the small size and isolation of its populations is the natural state (G. longifolia) and one for which it arose recently due to severe habitat fragmentation (G. caleyi). This comparative approach is important in identifying the processes involved in reducing population and species viability. The species share many aspects of their biology and ecology. Both are large, perennial shrubs that are self-compatible and naturally bird-pollinated. They are fire-sensitive and regenerate post-fire by mass germination from a long-lived, soil-stored seed bank. Both species consist of populations that vary dramatically in size and degree of isolation. I used microsatellite and AFLP markers to investigate aspects of the population genetics and mating system of these species, with the primary focus on G. caleyi. Both species showed a surprisingly large amount of genetic structuring among populations, although G. caleyi populations showed more structuring (FST = 0.46) than those of G. longifolia (FST = 0.33), despite being distributed over a much smaller area. In addition, for G. caleyi, most (63%) of the structuring was due to differences among recently-fragmented populations. By examining fine scale genetic structure within existing large populations, I determined that this was probably due to historic genetic structuring within formerly larger, more continuous populations. This has probably arisen due to both a lack of gene flow (no seed dispersal and limited pollen dispersal) and a large amount of inbreeding. Indeed, adult fixation indices were very high in G. caleyi (average f = 0.40, f &gt; 0 in 16/18 populations). For both species, genetic diversity was not strongly correlated with population size. Genetic diversity was significantly lower in more isolated populations of G. caleyi, but this was probably due to a historic lack of gene flow to the more isolated parts of the species&#8217; natural range, rather than to recent fragmentation. Levels of inbreeding (fixation indices) among adult plants did not vary with population size or isolation for either species. However, by genotyping fresh seeds from a range of small and large G. caleyi populations, I revealed that current outcrossing rates were much lower in small populations (t = 0.18 cf. 0.37). Observations of pollinator foraging indicated that this might be due to a very low visitation rate by birds and by a less diverse suite of species, resulting in a higher proportion of self-fertilisation. In contrast, even very small G. longifolia populations received many bird visits. In addition, G. caleyi plants in small populations were much smaller, had higher mortality, and produced fewer inflorescences and fruits, while this pattern was not apparent among G. longifolia populations. The contrast among the species in pollinator visits, plant vigour and reproduction may have been due to edge effects combined with the habitat degradation that was apparent at sites containing small G. caleyi populations. Small populations were typically found within very small and disturbed bush remnants, while small G. longifolia populations all occurred in relatively pristine habitat. Therefore, habitat quality rather than population size per se may be the most important factor that determines the mating system, plant vigour and fecundity in G. caleyi. The lack of obvious impacts of habitat fragmentation on the genetic  haracteristics of adult G. caleyi plants may have been due to the soil-stored seed bank, which can contain seeds produced by at least two adult generations. Various authors have hypothesised that a persistent seed bank has the potential to reduce the rate of genetic change in a population. The seed banks of both G. caleyi and G. longifolia do appear to have this ability. I found that the seed bank of each species maintains the genetic characteristics of populations and stores genetic diversity and alleles that were not expressed in the extant adult plants. Nevertheless, the seed bank also showed greater spatial structuring than adults, which indicates that genetic changes may be occurring within these small populations despite the buffering power of the seed bank. Finally, I investigated some aspects of the ecology of G. caleyi and G. longifolia seed banks, with the aim of increasing our understanding of this important conservation resource. Soil sieving revealed that the seeds of both pecies occur at very low densities beneath adult plants (1 &#8211; 6 m-2), were vastly outnumbered by seed fragments, and were not found away from adult canopies. This supports previous evidence that indicated a lack of seed dispersal and very high rates of post-dispersal seed predation, which will restrict population size and extent. To some degree, the seed bank may buffer demographic changes that affected the previous adult generation &#8211; monitoring of post-fire seedling emergence revealed that population size typically increased, often dramatically, after a fire. Germination experiments showed that smoke elicited the greatest germination response from intact seeds of both species, and that dormancy polymorphism in the seed bank may allow both species to survive two fires in rapid succession and long inter-fire intervals. However, germination was low in field fire experiments, which may have been due to low fire intensity, and hence smoke production, resulting from a winter prescription burn. For both species,  herefore, population viability may be compromised if the imposed fire regime includes fires that are too cool or too frequent. This study has demonstrated, for these species, that small populations that exist in recently fragmented habitat patches are far more likely to experience adverse ecological and genetic effects than those in continuous, relatively undisturbed, bushland. The process of demographic and genetic decline in small G. caleyi populations is likely to continue with the ongoing pressures of edge effects, habitat degradation and pollinator declines, and the increased isolation of some populations. The seed bank may buffer these declines to some extent, but this ability is limited by a lack of habitat for population expansion, which means that effective population sizes will remain very small or decrease further. The various differences detected between small and large G. caleyi populations emphasises the importance of large populations, and the ecological processes occurring within larger habitat patches, for the long-term conservation of the species.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depositional characteristics of recent and late Holocene overwash sandsheets in coastal embayments from southeast Australia</field><field name="creator">Switzer, Adam D</field><field name="description">Sedimentary evidence for large-scale washover deposition along the Australian southeast coast is found as sandsheets in estuaries and anomalous boulder accumulations on rocky ramps and headlands. Large imbricated allochtonous boulders found elevated up to 33m above present sea-level indicate high energy deposition on sheltered rock ramps and coastal headlands and attest to very high wave energy in the past. Analysis of the sedimentary structures within the boulders can in places be related to ramp lithology and identify significant transport distances where the original position of the boulder is identified. The most striking boulder deposits are found in the ambient location of a large bay and have been transported more than 30 m horizontally along a boulder ramp and elevated to a height of more than 7 m above present sea-level. Although this evidence is striking, it is impossible to identify if the boulders were moved in one movement or have been moved by several events over time.This study presents sedimentological evidence for a tsunami event(s) found in the upper fill of several embayments along the coast. Laterally extensive marine sandsheets are identified in back-barrier lagoons and elevated shell-rich sands are found on the margin of a large drowned river valley. These deposits exist up to 3km from the influence of modern coastal processes. The back-barrier sandsheets contrast with the finer confining sediments of the coastal lagoon and barrier estuary.Interpretation of the depositional history of the deposits is conducted with reference to a global review of overwash deposition and a modern analog from the southeast Australian coast. In the absence of any geological evidence for known tsunami events on this coast, the deposits are compared to two modern sandsheets that were deposited during two large storms in 2001. This study therefore allows direct comparison of the deposits of unknown source to the storm deposited sediments found Abrahams Bosom Beach.A large sandsheet is identified at Killalea Lagoon is composed of mixed marine sediment dominated by dune and beach sand but also containing platy heavy mineral assemblages indicative of nearshore to inner shelf sediments. This marine sediment is mixed with clumps of coastal vegetation and rip-up clasts of soil and lagoonal muds and clays.The marginal drowned river valley material in a small embayment at Batemans Bay includes a coarse shell-unit containing large, often articulated, bivalve shells and oysters, along with cobbles of mixed lithology in a matrix of marine sand suggesting deposition of predominantly seaward tidal channel material. The advantage of the sandy deposits lies in the analysis of their internal sedimentology and the presence of datable peat and shelly sands that confine the sand sheets and coarse shell-rich deposit respectively. The internal sedimentology of the deposit yields little structure and sediments consist of a series of massive, laminated and graded beds that often incorporate organic debris. These deposits contrast with storm washover deposits investigated at Abrahams Bosom Beach from the same coast that consist of thin graded beds of beach face and dune sediment only. These latter beds are a few centimeters thick and can be traced throughout the deposit. The storm deposits are the result of numerous wave-generated landward pulses while the larger more chaotic deposit is the result of several very large pulses capable of eroding and transporting shelf, nearshore, dune and terrestrial sediments landward followed by partial reworking by back flow. These characteristics are indicative of the chaotic reworking of such deposits by shortlived high-energy events attributed to tsunami. Dating of the Batemans Bay sequence was problematic and the shell-rich unit can only be confined to an age of around 1000 yrs At Killalea Lagoon optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz sediments from the sandsheets supplemented dating of the confining peat deposits by AMS radiocarbon.. Although affected by groundwater contamination, dates from the Killalea Lagoon site suggest that the depositional event is attributed to a large-scale inundation event around 1500AD adding to a considerable bank of published dates that cluster around this period. Possible tsunami sources include sediment slides off the continental slope of Australia or New Zealand, seismic events in New Zealand and the Macquarie Ridge and bollide impacts in the Tasman Sea or southwest Pacific.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of a subsurface lime-fly ash barrier in the mitigation of acid sulphate soils</field><field name="creator">Banasiak, Laura Joan</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of using a sub-surface lime-fly ash barrier to reduce the oxidation of a pyritic soil layer and to improve groundwater and surface water quality was investigated for land affected by acid sulphate soils near Berry in southeastern NSW, Australia. Prior to the installation of the lime-fly ash barrier, groundwater and surface water analyses indicated a highly acidic environment. High concentrations of dissolved aluminium, total iron and sulphate in the groundwater were a result of falling groundwater tables and biotic oxidation. Traditional management techniques of ground water manipulation, via floodgates or weirs, would be rendered ineffective in arresting biotic oxidation where the pyrite layer is submerged. The study combined field and laboratory analysis in order to determine the feasibility of the lime-fly ash barrier at the study site. A comprehensive field study incorporated the installation of piezometers and observation wells to determine the level of the phreatic surface along with the monitoring of water quality parameters at the site of the lime-fly ash barrier, and also floodgate sites and the site of the self-regulating tilting weir. The installation of the lime-fly ash barrier was undertaken by the pumping of a slurry through boreholes via pressure pumping. The subsurface lime-fly ash barrier, as an acid sulphate soil remediation technique, was shown to significantly improve groundwater quality. Groundwater pH increased to values between 4.5 and 5.5. The concentration of the pyritic oxidation products, acidic cations Al&#179;+ and Fetotal, basic cations Ca&#178;+ and Mg&#178;+ and anions Cl- and SO4&#178; -, also, on average decreased in the groundwater after the installation of the lime-fly ash barrier. A comparison between the average roundwater table elevations before and after the installation of the barrier also indicated a perched water table, which would reduce the exposure of pyritic soil to oxygen, and in turn reduce pyritic oxidation and the generation of acidic products. The Lime-fly ash barrier is effective in remediating acid sulphate soils in areas in which floodgates and weirs cannot be installed. A comparison of the result shows that the lime-fly ash barrier had greater success in increasing the groundwater pH than the self-regulating tilting weir. The lime-fly ash barrier treats acid sulphate soils and the related environmental problems before they occur, whereas, the floodgates treat the pyrite oxidation products generated after they have been discharged into the flood mitigation drains. Significantly greater concentrations of Al&#179;+, Fetotal and SO4 &#178;- were found in the groundwater at the floodgate sites.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endocrine correlates of social and reproductive behaviours in a group-living Australian Passerine, the White-Browed Babbler</field><field name="creator">Oppenheimer, Suzanne</field><field name="description">To investigate the evolutionary rationale for the seemingly altruistic behaviours commonly seen in cooperatively breeding Australian passerines, I examined alloparental behaviour in the White-browed Babbler Pomatostomus superciliosus (WBBA). Toward this end, I analysed behavioural, hormonal, and genetic factors in both free-living and captive WBBAs. Studies of free-living birds examined social and reproductive behaviours and hormonal correlates to reproduction. With captive birds, I performed both observations and manipulative experiments focusing on intragroup social structure, social behaviours, and the endocrine correlates to such structure and behaviours. The WBBA was selected as a study species as they live in sedentary, year-round social groups that engage in cooperative breeding. Field work was conducted in Back Yamma State Forest, in the central west region of New South Wales, Australia. In this population of WBBAs, groups included many close genetic relatives, and neighboring groups also shared several related individuals. There were multiple breeding pairs within most groups, and reproductive behaviours between breeding pairs were similar to those of many biparentally breeding songbirds. However, nest defense and postfledgling care were undertaken by large cooperative groups. In free-living WBBAs, plasma levels of testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), prolactin (Prl), and corticosterone (B) were measured, and laparotomies were performed to ascertain gonadal condition. Endocrine profiles in WBBAs were similar to those reported for a number of passerines and likely reflected physiological changes necessary for breeding, such as spermatogenesis and ovulation. Males&#65533; T profiles resembled those of some polygynous passerines, in that plasma T levels rose after the completion of the female partners&#65533; clutch. This may reflect the possibility for extra-pair copulations in WBBA groups with multiple breeding females. There was some indication that WBBAs&#65533; endocrine system may have been fine-tuned to support alloparental behaviour. In adult males that chaperoned fledglings and juveniles, elevated plasma Prl titres may have facilitated alloparental care. Furthermore, elevated plasma P levels in some adult females may have been related to non-breeding behaviour and perhaps also to care of post-fledging young. Unlike many temperate zone species, many WBBAs maintained recrudesced gonads for much of the year, reflecting their extended (if not perpetual) breeding season. Studies on captive WBBAs were conducted in aviaries at the University of Wollongong. Extensive observations were undertaken to investigate intragroup social structure and associated allofeeding behaviour. Despite an absence of aggression, intragroup social structure appeared stratified and was maintained by ritualised behaviours and vocalisations. In particular, allofeeding behaviour appeared to act as an important social signal within groups, indicating high social standing of the feeder and low social status of the receiver. Plasma levels of B and Prl were measured and compared to social factors, but I found no hormonal correlates to WBBA social status or behaviour in groups with stable social structures. To further examine the relationship between the endocrine system and social behaviours and structure, manipulative experiments were carried out on captive WBBAs. Removal of group members from socially stable groups elicited no overt aggression, and exchange of members between groups elicited little aggressive behaviour; however, both experiments resulted in significant social restructuring. Nevertheless, I found no significant hormonal correlates (T, E2, and B were measured) to social instability caused by these perturbations. Another social behaviour, roost nest building, was correlated with elevated plasma T and E2 levels, in some months of the year but not others. Field and captive studies of the WBBA supported hypotheses suggesting that (1) alloparental behaviours evolved via kin selection mechanisms and (2) alloparental behaviours are important signals of quality used to help select mates and/or attract collaborators. In WBBAs alloparental behaviours seem to be either directed toward kin or co-opted as a means of advertising social status.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holocene sea-level change and the aminostratigraphy of wave-dominated barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia</field><field name="creator">Sloss, Craig R</field><field name="description">The degree of aspartic acid racemisation measured in radiocarbon dated specimens of fossil molluscs collected from Holocene barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia is evaluated in the context of results of laboratory-induced racemisation established in heating (simulated ageing) experiments. The general kinetic trend of aspartic acid racemisation, in both heating experiments, and at ambient temperatures during diagenesis in the fossil molluscs Anadara trapezia and Notospisula trigonella conforms to a model of apparent parabolic kinetics. Using the apparent parabolic kinetic model, numeric ages based on the degree of aspartic acid racemisation in fossil specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella have been determined. Aspartic acid D/L ratios in Holocene specimens of A. trapezia and N. trigonella range from 0.049&#177;0.005 to 0.510&#177;0.009, representing an age range from &lt;50 yr to ca 8,000 yr. Accordingly, the Holocene amino- and chronostratigraphies of the wavedominated barrier estuaries Lake Illawarra, St Georges Basin, Swan Lake and Burrill Lake have been established based on the extent of aspartic acid racemisation measured in 290 specimens of fossil molluscs. For fossil material beyond the time span of the radiocarbon dating method (ca &gt;50 ka) and the calibration range of aspartic acid, relative ages have been determined based on the slower racemising acids alanine, valine, leucine and proline. The relative age determinations on older fossils indicate that Last Interglacial successions have been preserved at depth within the incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Aminostratigraphy, in conjunction with thermoluminescence dating, additional radiocarbon ages, and the litho- and biostratigraphic analysis of 141 vibracores, allowed the detailed assessment of the geomorphological evolution of wave-dominated barrier estuaries that formed in both broad, and narrow, incised valleys on the southeast coast of Australia. Results from the stratigraphic and geochronological analysis show that the estuaries investigated in this thesis have an evolutionary pathway that is different to previous models of barrier estuary evolution. In contrast to the earlier models of barrier estuary evolution, this thesis places a greater emphasis on the influence of the antecedent Late Pleistocene landsurface on hegeomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia. The Late Pleistocene sediments are represented by dense, mottled estuarine clays and/or by remnant barrier systems comprising medium-grained quartz sand with a clay matrix. The Late Pleistocene sediments preserved within the incised bedrock valleys represent sedimentary successions deposited during previous high-stands in sea-level that have undergone minor diagenetic alteration during subsequent sea-level lowstands. Therefore, the Late Pleistocene sediments now represent low-stand weathering profiles and provided the substrate over which Holocene sedimentary successions have been deposited. In particular, the preservation of remnant Last Interglacial barrier systems are found underlying the Holocene barrier systems and provide a core over which Holocene barrier sediments have accumulated.Results from this study have also shown that Holocene transgressive sands are more extensive than previously anticipated and form a basal, near basin-wide shell-rich deposit that extends almost up to present sea-level. The transgressive sandsheet facies lies unconformably over the Late Pleistocene antecedent landsurface and was deposited during the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT) when rising sea-levels breached Last Interglacial remnant barriers and inundated shallow incised valleys causing more open marine conditions to persist between 8,000 and ca 5,500 years ago. This contrasts with established models for barrier estuary evolution on the southeast coast of Australia where Holocene PMT sandsheets were restricted to the mouths of incised valleys and back-barrier central basin muds lie directly over the antecedent Pleistocene landsurface. This study also presents a database of 121 previously published radiocarbon ages obtained from fossil molluscs, organic material and fixed biological indicators from back-barrier sedimentary successions and the marginal marine environment on the southeast coast of Australia that have been used to constrain Holocene sea-level fluctuations. The database has been limited to fossil materials that have an accurate description of facies association and stratigraphic relationship to present mean sea-level (PMSL). An assessment of the uncertainty terms associated with the various proxy sea-level indicators is made and radiocarbon ages are calibrated to sidereal years. Additional radiocarbon ages and aspartic acid racemisationderived ages obtained on fossils preserved in the Holocene PMT sandsheets deposited inshallow incised valleys are presented in this thesis. A synthesis of the previously published radiocarbon ages and new data presented in this thesis has permitted a revised Holocene sealevel curve for the southeast coast of Australia to be delineated. Results show that rising sea levels during the most recent PMT attained an elevation of around -10 m by 10,000 cal yr BP and continued to rise to ca -5 m by 8,500 cal yr BP. Between 8,300 and 8,000 cal yr BP sealevel had risen to at least 3 m below PMSL and inundated shallow incised valleys, resulting in the deposition of shell-rich transgressive sandsheets. The most recent PMT sea-levels attained present levels around 7,700 cal yr BP, slightly earlier than a previously proposed culmination of ca 7,000 cal yr BP. Results indicate that sea-level continued to rise to between 1 and 1.5 m above PMSL by 7,400 cal yr BP during the culmination of the most recent PMT and was followed by a sea-level highstand that lasted to some time between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago. This was followed by a relatively slow and smooth regression of sea-level from ca +1.5 m to present levels. A series of minor negative and positive oscillations in relative sealevel associated with variations in ocean topography and/or climate change during the mid to late Holocene appear to be superimposed over the Holocene sea-level highstand and subsequent smooth sea-level regression.This study highlights the potential of aspartic acid racemisation as an important supplement for dating of fossils preserved in Holocene marginal marine deposits. This thesis also represents the most rigorous application of the aspartic acid racemisation dating method to the investigation of Holocene sedimentary infill of incised valley systems, and sea-level change during the most recent PMT. The evolutionary models of barrier estuary evolution developed in this thesis show that both the antecedent Late Pleistocene substrate and fluctuating Holocene sea levels have had a greater influence on the geomorphological evolution of barrier estuaries than previously anticipated. These revised models of estuary evolution can be applied to other shallow incised valley systems on tectonically stable, wavedominated coastlines, and provide a template for future studies in wave-dominated barrier estuaries on the southeast coast of Australia.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antecedents and consequences of the marketing manager and R&amp;D manager working relationship during new product development: an empirical study</field><field name="creator">Kyriazis, Elias</field><field name="description">The antecedents and consequences of 'interdepartmental working relations' have been examined in detail in the new product development (NPD) literature, however, less attention has been given to the relationship between functional managers at the interpersonal level.

By including interpersonal trust as a two-dimensional construct (affective and cognitive-based trust) and conceptualising it as a key mediating variable, the study provides great explanatory power regarding the interplay of important interpersonal dynamics such as communication frequency, quality of communication, functional conflict and interpersonal collaborative behaviour on the dependent variable of perceived relationship effectiveness. Further, the role that interpersonal politics play in shaping working relationships has not been previously addressed in the NPD literature and the new construct of 'Perceptions of the Marketing Manager as a Political Ally' was found to be one of the key antecedents of interpersonal trust and positive relationship dynamics. The data used to test the conceptual model was collected from 184 technically-trained respondents (e.g., R&amp;D Managers and Engineers) from Australian firms predominantly involved in manufacturing activities. The model tested was found to be rich in meaning and explained 80.5% of the variance in Perceived Relationship Effectiveness thus providing a greater understanding of the complexities of the working relationship at the Manager level than previous conceptualisations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into visual design in the development of educational Web-based projects</field><field name="creator">Knapp, Lesley</field><field name="description">The thesis describes a study of methods of developing online learning material by non-professional visual designers. The primary areas of investigation for the research were visual design and instructional design. It is the premise of the researcher that visual design skills and instructional design principles are interdependent for creating coherent educational resources. Academics are increasingly expected to design and develop projects for slide presentation and Websites. This is in part because the technology is available in the form of personal computers and development software. Access to the technology however doesn't mean access to design skills. Historically, graphic designers were responsible for making information presentable, legible and accessible. There is substantial evidence to support the theory that well presented information not only improves the learning experience but also facilitates deeper learning. Anecdotal evidence and texts acknowledge the problem of poorly designed interfaces in multimedia. Slide presentations frequently include distracting elements such as incongruous sound and animation. Web sites can be difficult to navigate requiring equanimity and patience. The proliferation of information delivered in formats other than print requires new skills and concepts to make sense of it. The combination of technology and the overwhelming amount of information readily available is creating an unprecedented challenge for the educator. Many studies have been undertaken to compare the learning outcomes of incorporating images, colour and other graphical representations into online learning material with inconclusive results. Educational theorists raise issues of the need to use the computer as a constructivist learning medium needing different instructional methods.

Pre-eminent among these measures is the particularly sensitive sea area (PSSA) concept; a tool that can be applied in an integrated manner, irrespective of maritime jurisdictional boundaries. However, despite the potential benefits that PSSA designation can deliver, recent practice both within the IMO and by individual member States, has considerably undermined confidence in this emerging concept, calling into question its whole basis as an effective management tool. Recent nominations by individual member States, for PSSA designation, have had the effect of dividing the IMO community over the scope and application of the PSSA concept, resulting in demands by several States to re-examine and constrain the concept. Some observers consider that the manner by which the IMO considers and decides upon applications for PSSA designation has aggravated this situation and have called for a review of the IMO approval process in its entirety. That this should occur at a time when many observers and coastal State members are increasingly realising the potential benefits of the PSSA concept is all the more cause for concern.The focus of this thesis is on the events within the IMO that have led to this lack of confidence arising. The central theme of the investigation is that the current situation can largely be attributed to the actions of certain member States, in their interpretation and implementation of the PSSA concept, and to the current mechanisms adopted by the IMO for reviewing and approving individual submissions for PSSA designation. A number of specific issues can also be identified with the PSSA Guidelines themselves. This thesis presents an examination of coastal State practice with the PSSA concept, and seeks to address how confidence in the measure can be restored, while satisfying both coastal and maritime States&#8217; interests. In undertaking this analysis, the research provides evidence of the value of the PSSA concept, but also demonstrates its limitations. In this regard, the thesis presents a &#8216;reality check&#8217; which seeks to rationalise some of the heightened expectations with the concept that are apparent in the current debate. The research argues that States may seek to designate PSSAs more for their &#8216;iconic status&#8217; than for any demonstrable environmental benefits that may be realised. Such an approach will contribute to the current lack of confidence in the measure and could conceivably result in a complete and irrevocable loss of confidence in the measure by the shipping community.On the basis of the empirical analysis presented and the comparison with alternative protection strategies, this thesis draws conclusions over the value of the PSSA concept and makes recommendations for the future development of the concept. A number of specific amendments are suggested for the PSSA Guidelines themselves, as well as changes to the institutional arrangements for reviewing and approving PSSA nominations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Verification of an independent monitor unit calculation program for IMRT quality assurance</field><field name="creator">Currie, Michael Peter</field><field name="description">Independent monitor unit (MU) calculations are a vital part of radiotherapy treatment planning quality assurance. In the case of complex treatment planning methods, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), traditional independent monitor unit calculations using tables of beam data and manual calculations are inadequate. Recently, computer programs have been developed that can perform independent monitor unit calculations for IMRT treatment plans using scatter summation methods. One such program is RadCalc, produced by Lifeline Software Inc. The purpose of this project was to test RadCalc, and determine whether it is suitable for routine use in IMRT treatment planning quality assurance.Once the software was installed, beam data measured on the treatment linear accelerator (linac) was imported into RadCalc, to be used in MU calculations. RadCalc was tested for data integrity to ensure that the correct data was accessed for its calculations. The interface between RadCalc and the treatment planning system, Pinnacle3, was set up so that treatment plan data could be imported directly from Pinnacle3 into RadCalc. Test plans were imported into RadCalc to ensure the Pinnacle3-RadCalc interface was working correctly.Test plans were created with open, blocked, segmented and IMRT fields, and delivered to a phantom on the linac to test RadCalc&#8217;s block correction algorithm. Doses were measured using a thimble ionisation chamber, and compared to the doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3. The agreement between RadCalc and measured doses for most situations was comparable to the agreement between Pinnacle3 and measured doses. However, a systematic difference between RadCalc and measured dose was shown to occur for asymmetric fields. In addition to this, an increase in the level of blocking of the calculation point for segmented and IMRT fields appeared to increase the difference between RadCalc and measured dose.Thirty-two patient IMRT plans at the Illawarra Cancer Care Centre (ICCC) were verified by reproducing the plan using a phantom CT dataset, and then delivering the fields to the phantom and measuring the delivered dose. This data was compared to the doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3. The doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3 for the plans created on patient CT datasets were also compared. In analysing the data, a systematic difference between RadCalc and measured dose was detected. Improved agreement was achieved by adjusting the MLC transmission parameter in RadCalc. The average percentage difference per field for the phantom plans between RadCalc and measured dose was 0.1% with a standard deviation 5.3%, while the average percentage difference between Pinnacle3 and measured dose was -0.2% with a standard deviation of 4.2%. The average percentage difference for total plan dose for the phantom plans between RadCalc and measured dose was 0.0% with a standard deviation 1.7%, while the average percentage difference between Pinnacle3 and measured dose was -0.3% with a standard deviation of 1.1%. For the patient plans, the average percentage difference per field between RadCalc and Pinnacle3 was 0.8% with a standard deviation of 5.6%, while the average percentage difference per plan was 1.1% with a standard deviation of 1.1%.The final recommendation is that RadCalc is accurate enough for routine IMRT treatment planning quality assurance. A physical measurement should accompany the RadCalc check to verify the transfer of data to the record and verify system and the dose delivery process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary school choice selection: examining parental school choice decision behaviour using the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="creator">Goh, Edmund</field><field name="description">Many studies have tried to identify why parents might choose a particular primary school for their children, but none have taken advantage of established behavioural theories to analyse school choice systematically. This study uses the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the theory of planned bhaviour (TPB) to gain insight into why parents choose government primary school in the Wollongong region, Australia. The research used a mixed methods approach comprised of a focus group (n=7), short surveys (n=40), long surveys (n=13), short interviews (n=10), long interviews (n=10) and a literature review to elicit salient beliefs of the parents. Based on the elicitation study, a questionnnaire was developed for a quantitative study (n=93) to predict parental behavioural intentions to choose a government school for their children. Results of the quantitative study showed that the TRA (R2=67.8 per cent) was more useful over the TPB (R2=66.9 per cent) in the prediction of government school choice intentions. Attitude emerged as the strongest predictor of behavioural intentions, while perceived behavioural control did not emerge as a significant predictor. The main factors that affected choice of a government school included the proximity of schools to homes and absence of religious teachings. The following important reference groups emerged as influential: husband and wife, relatives and school teachers. By demonstrating the significance of these predictors, this present study is helpful to public primary schools and policy makers in providing guidance which marketing measures could be taken to increase the probability of parents choosing a public primary school for their child.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fat flat feet: footwear for the obese child</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Annaliese</field><field name="description">Obesity is a global public health problem that affects both children and adults.

Previous studies have reported that obese children display different foot structural characteristics and generate higher plantar pressures, particularly under the midfoot and forefoot, compared to non-obese children. It has been speculated that these higher plantar pressures may potentially place the feet of obese children at risk of injury, although this notion has not been confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a shoe to cater for the unique structural and functional characteristics of the obese child and to examine whether the experimental shoe improved the level of shoe fit, comfort and decreased the high forefoot plantar pressures experienced by obese children when walking. To achieve this aim, the thesis was divided into two Experimental Sections, incorporating the development and assessment of the experimental footwear. In Experimental Section 1 foot shape, foot structure and function were evaluated in 437 children (aged 7-12 years) attending 27 primary schools in New South Wales to form a database of information regarding the feet of Australian children. Gender and age were found to affect the foot measurements obtained for these children, confirming that children&#8217;s feet develop at different rates and proportions. The boys displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the girls and, as anticipated, the older children displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the younger children. When these data were compared to adult foot dimension values they highlighted differences in proportion between adult and children&#8217;s feet, indicating the need to develop a children&#8217;s shoe last, as shoes manufactured as scaled-down versions of adult shoes will not correctly fit the foot shape of children&#8217;s feet. From this normative database the foot dimensions, plantar shape and plantar pressure variables for 45 obese children and 45 age and gender&#8211;matched controls were compared to establish the effect of obesity and gender on foot structure and function. The obese children displayed significantly greater values for 17 out of the 26 foot/leg dimensions, as well as an increased plantar contact area compared to their matched non obese counterparts. As no interaction was identified between gender and obesity, it was confirmed that the effects of obesity were not moderated by gender. In comparison to the non-obese children, the obese children generated higher forces, force-time integrals, peak pressures, pressure-time integrals and increased plantar contact area when walking compared to the non-obese children. Based on these results it was recommended that a shoe should be designed to cater for the larger foot dimensions characteristic of obese children and to cushion the larger plantar pressure distributions generated when these children walk. A survey was also undertaken to identify factors that influence the purchasing of children&#8217;s shoes. Parents indicated that fit and comfort were important factors influencing their footwear purchases for their child, even though few parents regularly had their child professionally fitted for shoes. It was anticipated that shoes would need to be replaced because the child had outgrown them, although there was also a high proportion of shoes being replaced because they had been worn out. An experimental shoe was designed to cater for obese children based on the foot structure, function and survey data. The two main design parameters included in the shoes were an increase in forefoot width to cater for the large foot dimensions of obese children and variations in midsole hardness to cushion the high plantar pressures. Six experimental shoes were evaluated by 14 children who were classified as either overweight and obese children or non-overweight children. Experimental Section 2 investigated how variations in shoe width and midsole hardness affected the fit, comfort, plantar pressures and gait in the two subject groups. A shoe fit assessment revealed no noticeable differences between the experimental shoes by the children. The shoe comfort and fit parameters, which were assessed via a visual analog scale, demonstrated that these parameters, when used in the evaluation of footwear, relied on individual perceptions of the wearer. The overweight/obese children did report slightly higher shoe fit and comfort values when wearing the wide shoe compared to the narrow shoe although this difference was not significant. However, the non-overweight children reported higher fit and comfort values than the overweight/obese children when wearing the wide shoes. In general, the plantar pressure distributions at the foot/shoe interface were lower than the previous barefoot values, indicating that footwear moderated the plantar pressure distributions generated during walking. Changes in shoe width and midsole density were found to to have negligible affect on the in-shoe plantar pressure variables and spatio-temporal gait parameters, which may be attributable to the small differences reported in shoe fit assessment. The soft shoes resulted in lower peak pressures being generated under the forefoot but higher peak pressures for the heel and midfoot. The overweight/obese children, regardless of footwear condition, altered their gait to cope with the stresses placed on their feet during walking. Clearly, further research is required to develop shoes to cater for the unique feet of obese children and to better dissipate loading during gait. It was concluded that a shoe based on the unique foot structure, shape and function of obese children is required by these children. However, the difficulty in designing such a shoe that is universally suitable for obese children because of differential foot development, are acknowledged. Further, perceptions of shoe fit and shoe comfort are highly subjective variables, compounding appropriate shoe design. This thesis highlighted that without good levels of shoe fit, it is difficult to achieve optimal shoe comfort. Although a shoe was developed based on the unique features of obese children&#8217;s feet, more modifications are required to the experimental shoes, especially in shoe width, in order to improve shoe fit.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reactions of zinc vapour with steel relevant to the Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si hot dip metal coating process</field><field name="creator">Williams, Joseph James</field><field name="description">Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel strip is manufactured by the continuous hot dipping process. An important difference in the processing of Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel when compared with galvanised steel is the higher temperature of the molten alloy bath &#8211;600&#186;C for Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coatings versus 450&#186;C for galvanised. This increase in temperature leads to an accelerated rate of evaporation of zinc into the pretreatment furnace, leading in turn to various processing difficulties. Zinc vapour in the pre-treatment furnace has long been implicated with defects known within the industry as pinholes and bare patches - uncoated areas where wetting does not occur between the strip and the molten alloy. Despite the association with zinc vapour, the exact mechanisms of pinhole and bare patch formation have not been clearly established. One possible mechanism of pinhole and bare patch formation is the direct reaction of zinc vapour with the strip surface. It has been suggested by industry experts that zinc vapour could condense on the strip, leaving a deposit that prevents wetting by molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy. It remains that little is understood of the fundamental nature of the interaction between zinc vapour and a steel substrate. The purpose of this research was to examine the rates and mechanisms of zinc vapour condensation on clean and oxidised steel substrates. Such information is essential for understanding the reactions that occur in the metal coating line furnace. It is intended that this research will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base upon which a solution to the problem can be developed. The experimental work conducted in this study was centred on condensing zinc vapour onto substrates under specific gaseous atmospheres at atmospheric pressure. A major part of the work involved the development of a technique for depositing zinc vapour onto a steel substrate and the design and construction of an experimental apparatus. Preliminary studies were undertaken to define the design criteria for an apparatus in which the rate of condensation of zinc vapour could be measured accurately and the interaction between zinc vapour and clean and oxidised steel substrates could be examined. In this probing exercise, modifications were made to a proven design of an apparatus designed to measure evaporation rates of metals in inert gas atmospheres was used. The preliminary experiments provided a wealth of essential knowledge required to design an experimental facility in which it was possible to accurately measure the rate of condensation of zinc vapour and to study the interaction between zinc vapour and the steel substrate, as well as their potential chemical reactions. This new apparatus was specifically developed for a quantitative assessment of zinc vapour deposition, and allowed the substrate and zinc vapour to be heated in independent, but interconnecting chambers. The exposure of the substrate to the zinc vapour could be controlled with precision, and it was possible to not only measure the zinc vapour condensation rates, but also to assess the effect of using oxidising and reducing gasses during preheating of the substrate. Under conditions of high undercooling, zinc vapour deposited by the island plus continuous thin film mode, while at higher substrate temperatures, close to that expected in the industrial process, the zinc deposited more slowly, and zinc islands did not form on the substrate within the first 60 seconds of exposure. Deposition of zinc vapour on an oxidised substrate occurred at a much higher rate than on a clean steel substrate. This increase in deposition rate has been attributed to a direct reaction occurring between the zinc vapour and the iron oxide without the formation of any liquid condensate. The reaction is: Fe3O4(s) + 4Zn(v) &#8596; 4ZnO(s) + 3Fe(s) This reaction will proceed to the right under sufficiently high partial pressures of zinc vapour, and at substrate temperatures both above and below the saturation temperature of the zinc vapour. It was observed that under sufficiently low partial pressures of zinc vapour, the above reaction is driven to the left. Zinc oxide has a determining influence on the wetting of the strip by the molten alloy. Immersion tests, wherein substrates deposited with zinc vapour were dipped into molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy, were carried out to examine the effect of various zinc vapour reactions on the quality of the coatings. Deposition of zinc vapour on both clean and oxidised steel surfaces had a detrimental effect on the coating quality. In cases where zinc was deposited onto a clean steel substrate prior to immersion in the coating alloy, pinholes resulted, while zinc vapour deposition on an oxidised surface prior to immersion led to large scale uncoated areas.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weld path optimisation for rapid prototyping and wear replacement by robotic gas metal arc welding</field><field name="creator">Siminski, Michael</field><field name="description">Rapid prototyping (RP) is a large and rapidly growing industry with many different processes either under development or already available commercially. These processes offer fast and flexible production of objects from a wide range of materials. They vary from being able to produce only prototypes of products, through to being suitable for production of finished products ready for service. Rapid prototyping by robotic gas metal arc welding (GMAW) uses metal deposited by the GMAW process to build metal products with engineering  properties suitable for service conditions. Wear replacement (WR) involves the repair of worn metal surfaces through the deposition of weld metal, and can also be performed using robotic GMAW. Since both rapid prototyping and wear replacement by robotic GMAW involve the building up of metal objects from metal deposited by the GMAW process, it is possible to combine research in this area. Rapid prototyping and wear replacement using the robotic GMAW process may however give rise to stability problems. Geometric and thermal instability can be an inherent feature of the process, resulting in relatively poor dimensional accuracy and surface quality. Various research directions have been taken in the past in order to address these problems, however the effects of weld path design on process stability have not yet been well researched. The objective of this thesis was to study what effects weld path design can have on the stability of rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW, in order to test whether weld path design could be used to improve process stability and performance. The hypothesis adopted in this thesis was that improved geometric and thermal stability should be possible if the material and heat input are optimised by control of the weld path through weld path design. It was found that the stability of the rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW process is very sensitive to weld path design and that optimised open-loop weld path design can be used to greatly improve process stability and performance. A number of different mechanisms were identified through which the weld path design impacts on the stability and performance of the process and corresponding recommendations for weld path design were presented. The suitability of various weld path designs for different types of applications was assessed and the most optimal weld path designs for an expected wide range of applications were identified. By using one of the most recommended path strategies, rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW systems can enjoy improved geometric and thermal stability and fewer problems with weld defects, through the choice of weld path. It was predicted that the most successful commercial rapid prototyping and wear replacement by robotic GMAW systems would utilise a flexible and multi-faceted approach, using a combination of technologies, in order to best address the various needs of the process as required for key areas of industrial application.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methodologies for information source selection under distributed information environments</field><field name="creator">Yang, Hui</field><field name="description">The information revolution is upon us. In fact, we are increasingly overwhelmed by the exponential growth of information on the Web. The profusion of resources on the Web has given rise to considerable interest in the research of information retrieval. Traditional information retrieval techniques are facing new challenges in distributed information environments such as the Internet. One of the more important research issues is information source selection, which is to select a small number of information sources that may contain most of the potentially useful documents when a user information need is presented. This thesis investigates new methodologies for information source selection in distributed information environments. We have identified potential selection cases within the context of distributed textual databases, and have classified the types of textual databases. The connection between selection cases and database types is analysed, and necessary constraints are given for each selection case. The above research results could be used as the guidance for developing effective database selection algorithms. A framework for a topic-based database selection system is proposed by the use of a topic hierarchy. In this framework, firstly, distributed textual databases are hierarchically categorised into a topic hierarchy for convenience of access and management. Secondly, two-stage database language models are presented to employ topic-based database selection within the context of the hierarchy of topics. At the category-specific search stage, a smoothed class-based language model is developed to determine the appropriate topic categories with respect to the user query. A number of databases associated with the chosen topics are selected as candidate databases for the next search stage. At the term-specific search stage, a smooth term-based language model is used to find the databases that are likely to contain the specified query terms. Finally, the original selection result is further refined by a set of topic-based association rules. These topic-based association rules contain useful information about the relationships between databases, which are extracted from a collection of previous selection results. To overcome the drawback of the keyword-based search, which treats words as independent of each other, ignoring potential semantic relationships between words, in this thesis, we propose a concept-based search mechanism to search distributed web databases using domain-specific ontologies. A domain-specific ontology provides rich information about the semantic relationships between concepts in a specific topic domain. This information is used for the generation of concept-related resource descriptions of web databases, query disambiguation and concept-based query matching in database selection.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the characteristics of oxide scale in hot rolling of steel</field><field name="creator">Sun, Weihua</field><field name="description">In hot steel rolling the continuous exposure of metal to air produces a layer of oxide scale on the surface of the steel. This layer of scale separates the work roll from the metal substrate. Its behavior and features affect the roll bite tribology and final quality of the product. This study aims to characterize the oxide scale features and improve our understanding of the behavior of oxide scale during hot rolling.Oxide scale surface topography features and the morphology of scale layers were analyzed by SEM, X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and AFM. The kinetics of growth of the layer of scale of low-carbon steel and a mild-steel were carried out on a Gleeble-3500 Thermal Mechanical Simulation System to simulate a hot finishing strip mill. An investigation of scale growth on an as-supplied surface proved that the growth of the original 21&#956;m layer of scale decreased as the steel oxidized further.The effects of hot rolling on the surface roughness and oxide layers such as reduction, roll speed, and entry temperature, were investigated to identify any significant parameters. Hot rolling experiments were carried out on a HILLE-100 experimental rolling mill. Five lubricating modes were used in the rolling tests to examine the deformation behavior of the oxide scale layer and changes to its surface roughness, these included dry rolling and water, oil/water emulsions and pure oil. The effects of the original ground sample surface roughness in analyzing the outcome of surface features after hot rolling was also taken into account.The surface profiles of the scale layer and the picked steel surface, where the scale were removed with an inhibitor-added hydrochloric acid, were analyzed. The temperature and reduction showed a significant change, i.e., the lower the temperature the greater the reduction and less surface roughness. On the other hand, rolling speed had a limited effect on surface roughness. The surface roughness of the original sample affects the product profiles when reduction is smaller than 35% and also, the effect of lubrication depends on reduction. The effect of the thickness of the oxide scale on the roughness of the pickled surface is affected by lubrication.In this present study, the deformation behavior of oxide scale was investigated on two types of scale, the primary at 330-512&#956;m in thickness and the secondary at 41-80&#956;m in thickness. After rolling, it was observed that the thickness of secondary scale layer reduces more than the primary scale layer, while in turn the latter reduces more than the metal substrates. AFM images and SEM results demonstrate that the secondary oxide scale layer is a little ductile. Crack developments in both primary and secondary scale were discussed according to reduction and stalled rolling, respectively. It was found in the present study that fresh metal extruded up the cracks in the secondary oxide scale but were unable to touch the roll surface. An index &#947; was introduced to describe the secondary oxide scale expansion property due to hot rolling.An inverse calculation of the coefficient of friction found no significant effect on the coefficient of friction from the thickness of the secondary oxide scale layers at the exit of the roll bite. Two empirical equations that correlate the coefficient of friction &#956; with the reduction &#949; (%), roll speed v (m/s) and absolute temperature T have been obtained.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machine learning of human behavioural skills through observation</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xucheng</field><field name="description">Acquisition of the behavioural skills of a human operator and recreating them in an intelligent autonomous system has been a critical but rather challenging step in the development of complex intelligent autonomous systems. A systematic and generic method for realising this process will greatly simplify the development, commissioning and maintenance of autonomous systems. A human operator automatically employs tacit skills to perform a dynamic real time task. Application of conventional knowledge acquisition systems is not sufficient to acquire the employed skills as the operator is typically unable to provide an accurate and complete description of the employed skills and their sequence. The feasibility of acquiring the human behavioural skills has been explored in this thesis. The work has been carried out in the context of transferring those skills to a biped robot. The focus has been on the human postural and locomotor movements. A fuzzy clustering method is developed and applied to identify different movements of the human hand. The motion is measured by a dual-axis accelerometer and a gyroscope mounted on the hand. The gyroscope is used to locate the position and configuration of the hand, whereas the accelerometer measures the kinematic parameters of the movement. The covariance and the mean of the data produced by the sensors are used as features in the clustering process. The clustering method is applied to the data produced from the human wrist movements to identify the sequence of the motion primitives embedded in them. Furthermore, the relationship between these primitives in the context of the performed task is reconstructed using a Hidden Markov Model. The progress made and the results obtained are reported and a critical review of the outcomes produced is carried out.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and manufacture of a high temperature superconducting magnetic energy storage device</field><field name="creator">Hawley, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Micro-Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (&#956;-SMES) technology has emerged as a method for mitigating voltage sags for smaller scale applications using energy storage capacities of less than 100kJ. These units are designed to mitigate low frequency (&lt;1kHz) voltage sags in power distribution systems extending the lifetime of electronic loads by reducing voltage fluctuations and reducing load outages due to under-voltage trips. Improvements in cryogenic and switching technologies indicates that &#956;-SMES are becoming a competitive alternative to other medium voltage sag mitigation devices such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) in terms of both efficiency, reliability and economics.This thesis details the work performed in the design, implementation and testing of a prototype High transition Temperature Superconductor (HTS) SMES device. The design and construction of the prototype includes development of the energy storage medium, cooling system and the Power Conditioning Circuit (PCC). The energy storage medium for the SMES prototype is designed using theoretical and Finite Element Modelling (FEM) tools and the initial design fabricated using HTS BSCCO- 2223 tape manufactured by Australian Superconductors.The refrigeration system to cool the HTS coil comprises of a gaseous helium cold head cryocooler used to maintain the coil at a temperature of 30K, via the  onduction cooling method, with a maximum heat load of 25W when mounted in the prototype vacuum sealed cryostat. This design improves the Ic characteristic of the coil compared to that at 77K by a factor of 4.7, and hence improves the energy storage by a factor of 22.The prototype SMES PCC is capable of supplying a three phase load, accurately maintaining the current flowing in the energy storage medium during the steady state and reacting almost instantaneously to deliver energy to the load during voltage sags; successfully maintaining the load voltage at a specified level. The PCC has been constructed as a part of the process of developing a larger 20kJ system aimed at industrial applications, with reference to a particular power quality study performed that represents the typical application.

Successful management depends on appropriate monitoring of the health and extent of the seagrass meadows. This field-based spectral reflectance study generated baseline data that optimises the mapping of seagrass meadows, and has laid the groundwork for the monitoring of the physiological condition of meadows by hyperspectral remote sensing.A comprehensive spectral library of the three common seagrass species  nominating meadows in south eastern Australia (Zostera capricorni, Posidonia australis and Halophila ovalis) was produced by field spectrometry in order to characterise the spectral response and the variability inherent in the reflectance of these seagrasses growing in their natural environment across different estuaries, habitats, seasons and years. There was small but significant spatial and temporal variability in the spectral reflectance recorded for each seagrass species, and in addition, the level of epibiont fouling of the seagrass leaves also induced significant intraspecific spectral differences. Despite this within-species variability, the seagrasses Z. capricorni, P. australis and H. ovalis were shown to be spectrally distinct across wide regions of the visible wavelengths, notably in those wavelength regions least affected by attenuation in an estuarine water column. Differences in the spectral signatures of the three seagrass species could mainly be attributed to differences in leaf morphology, although photosynthetic and accessory pigment concentrations, determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometry, did play an important role in determining reflectance. Within-species differences in seagrass leaf reflectance were linked to differences in leaf pigment composition, predominantly chlorophyll content, but structural changes in the internal anatomy of the leaves and differences in epibiont fouling were also implicated. Piece-wise multiplicative scatter correction (PMSC) was found to be a useful tool for the compilation of spectral libraries since it removes external spectral variation associated with sample illumination and viewing geometry from the reflectance signatures, while highlighting the spectral reflectance variability inherent in the plants themselves.Laboratory spectrometry was used to characterise the spectral changes that occurred in Z. capricorni leaves as the health of this seagrass declined in response to conditions of low and high light stress in laboratory experiments. Zostera capricorni was able to photoacclimate and chromatically acclimate to changes in irradiance over the short term (within days). Low light treated Z. capricorni were subjected to irradiance levels below their compensation point and within one to three months these samples were dead or had lost most of their biomass. Photosynthetic rate, measured by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluoro metry, was reduced and the efficiency of light use maximised in light-deprived Z. capricorni compared with control plants. Low light stress ed leaves displayed lower chlorophyll a:b, zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin concentrations (measured by HPLC) than control plants within two weeks of exposure, but over the longer term showed a general increase in photosynthetic pigment concentration to maximise light harvesting. Orange shoulder (far-green to near&#8211;red) reflectance decreased significantly in response to shade treatment in concert with these pigment changes, however, significant increases in the green peak and NIR reflectance of low light stressed Z. capricorni were considered to represent changes in leaf internal structure rather than pigment content. Exposure to high irradiance decreased the efficiency of photosynthetic energy conversion in Z. capricorni leaves compared to samples grown at moderate light levels but increased photosynthetic rate. High light treatment significantly increased the concentration of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (VAZ, i.e. violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeoxanthin) relative to other Z. capricorni leaf pigments and increased the proportion of VAZ pool occurring in the de-epoxidised state compared to controls. Hence, Z. capricorni displayed light-dependent downregulation of photosynthesis in response to high light stress and did not suffer photooxidative damage or reductions in growth or biomass during high light experiments. High light treated seagrass leaves displayed significantly lower green and far-red reflectance and significantly higher orange shoulder reflectance concurrent with these pigment changes and probable changes in leaf structure. In addition, a blue shift of the red edge and a red shift of the green edge were detected in the spectral reflectance of high light stressed seagrass leaves. The anthocyanin content of Z. capricorni leaves was not affected by ambient irradiance levels in these laboratory experiments.Significant linear relationships were observed for Z. capricorni in the concentration of chlorophyll a:b, VAZ:total carotenoids, VAZ:total chlorophyll, and A+Z:VAZ concentrations, and in spectral reflectance at wavelengths 550, 630 and 685 nm, as a function of average daily irradiance measured in the laboratory and in the field. These pigment-based indicators of light stress in Z. capricorni were significantly correlated with a number of hyperspectral reflectance indices and derivative indices, however correlation coefficients were typically low (r &lt; 0.66). The blue-green, blue-orange index [BGBO = (R495/R550) - (R495/R635)] developed in this thesis displayed significant linear relationships with chlorophyll a:b, VAZ:total carotenoids and VAZ:total chlorophyll content and showed the best potential as a remote sensing index for monitoring light stress in seagrass meadows. For an independent data set consisting of field-measured spectral reflectance for three seagrass species, measured chlorophyll a:b content explained 48% of the variation in chlorophyll a:b predicted by the  bluegreen, blue-orange index.Estuary managers should look toward the future by establishing high spectral and spatial resolution seagrass mapping and monitoring campaigns. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. In addition, the research comprehensively combined ecophysiology and biochemical analysis with hyperspectral data to establish the characteristic spectral reflectance changes occurring in Z. capricorni in response to light stress. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping and monitoring of seagrass species in Australia. Furthermore, this research has laid the groundwork for the early detection of physiological stress in seagrass meadows, including development of a new plant stress index applicable to vegetation in general.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discursive analysis of the relationships between instruction, learning and the development of the higher mental processes during dialogues about writing between a teacher and three five-year-old children during their first year of formal education</field><field name="creator">Geekie, Peter Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on an observational study using data collection methods which were ethnographic in spirit. The primary data consisted of video recordings of a teacher talking to each of three five-year-old children as they attempted to write simple written language texts. Five such sessions were recorded for each child during the school year. The inquiry was based upon the assumption that most could be learnt about literacy learning by observing successful learners. All three children learnt to write during the year of observation. While prolonged engagement on the research site, and the use of field notes and informants is ethnographic in emphasis, the methods of analysis, however, were derived from: -ethnomethodological analyses of talk designed to reveal the 'commonsense' knowledge of participants during social interaction; -studies in discursive psychology which were designed to reveal how the mental processes are constituted through talk; &#65533;studies of educational discourse which showed the ways in which educational knowledge is made common through classroom talk and action. The analyses were, therefore, designed to expose: 'the children's socio-cultural knowledge (especially their knowledge of how to participate in 'story writing'); - the ways in which mental processes were discursively constructed and used during these 'story writing sessions'; - the interaction between instruction and learning during the sessions. Prolonged engagement at the research site also made possible an examination of the ways in which exchanges between the teacher and the children changed during the year. This permitted conclusions to be drawn about 'the ways in which the children's knowledge and competence as participants in 'story writing' changed during the year; - the relationships between instruction and learning; - the relationship between the development of the mental processes and the growth in writing competence. The analyses of the data show that the role of the teacher in promoting successful literacy learning was very much like the role played by adults in supporting initial language acquisition. Learning to write, like learning to speak, involved the negotiation of understanding and the achievement of shared knowledge. The teacher&#65533;s instructional behaviour was characterized by contingency of response, the inclusion of children in decision-making and problem-solving and 'strategic thinking aloud' which helped the child to become aware of the mental processes involved in successful task completion. An important aspect of the children's growth in competence as writers was that the talk during 'story writing' was concerned not just with how to spell words and how to punctuate texts, but also with the development of broader understandings of literacy. Even in this group of five-year-olds the teacher was already developing an awareness of matters of style and an understanding of the purposes of literacy, including an appreciation of the power of literacy as a means of constructing and exploring 'possible worlds'. The issue of how the children learnt to recognize and write words is considered at length, not because the author of this thesis considers reading and writing to be essentially matters of word recognition and production, but because information processing accounts of literacy have insisted that sound/letter relationships had to be directly and systematically taught. This assertion was not supported by the current study. While the children learnt to segment speech phonemically and learnt a great deal about letter/sound relationships during the year, evidence was presented which suggested that learning to recognize and write words essentially involved learning how to exercise conscious control over the mental processes rather than developing automatic responses to print through drills and practices. In fact, it is concluded that the relationship between the mental processes and the development of writing competence must be considered if a proper understanding of literacy learning is to be developed. It seemed that, in the course of learning to write, the mental processes were reconstructed conversationally in accordance with the demands of the task. 'Story writing' was the 'work' of the classroom, and the satisfactory completion of this 'work' demanded that children developed new ways of attending and remembering and perceiving. For example, 'story writing' (as practised in this classroom) demanded that the children should learn to remember where they had previously seen needed words. At first they needed high levels of support to do this, but as they participated in such acts of remembering with their teacher's assistance, they developed specific ways of remembering over which they could exercise voluntary control. These new ways of remembering then connected with shared experiences of books and reading. Instead of just referring to charts and signs in the classroom, they used their ways of remembering both in constructing their texts, and in checking their invented spellings against the conventional ones in books. This meant that they became aware that books could be used as points of reference, and that they provided contact with other authors and their ways of solving problems. It also contributed to the development of an awareness of conventional ways of telling stories as well as writing words. The major conclusion of the study is that becoming literate both develops the mental processes, and is dependent on those developments.

Channels of the contemporary distributary system are characterized by downstream declining discharges, in part a result of the interaction of the modern system with remnants of the preceding palaeochannel systems. The hydraulic geometry of the contemporary channels revealed that these distributaries do not have a uniform response to declining discharge, with differences in heights of off-takes leading to differences in sedimentology, hydrology and channel morphology. Of the four distributaries, the Gwydir River is the bedload transporting trunk stream, hence its hydraulic geometry is fundamentally influenced by the need to maintain bedload conveyance as discharge declines downstream. It maintains a relatively deep channel facilitated in part by adoption of an anabranching habit in its lower reaches, and by relatively continuous flow that keeps its bed free of vegetation. Hence it has a relatively low W/D ratio. Contrary to an expectation for clay dominated bedload-free channels with banks of high material strength, depth in the Mehi, Moomin and Carole declines relatively rapidly downstream with little or no change in width. This results in large increases in W/D ratio downstream. It appears that long intervals of no flow in these three distributaries with their elevated off-takes encourage the growth of dense sturdy vegetation on their beds, directing flow energy to the banks during flood events. Planform analyses show that bend radius of curvature and meander wavelength are strongly correlated with discharge, channel depth and flow velocity, but are poorly correlated with width. Width appears to be responding to conditions other than discharge, probably the presence of within-channel vegetation. The negative correlation between sinuosity and unit stream power, and between sinuosity and apparent bank strength, indicate that an increase in channel width allows or indeed requires a decrease in gradient through meandering. Analyses of the palaeochannels of the Gwydir fan-plain revealed that alluvial quartz grains here are unsuitable for traditional thermoluminescence analysis, as it is invariably heavily contaminated with inclusions of feldspar which causes severe age underestimation. An alternative single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) method shows that downstream fluvial transport of quartz in contemporary channels increases its luminescence sensitivity due to repeated cycles of burial and exposure. Three potential applications of this finding are; a) sediment tracing, b) river hydrology description and c) palaeochannel connectivity analysis Application of the revised OSL technique reveals that the palaeochannels on the surface of the Gwydir fan-plain date from at least 70 ka. The oldest, the Challicum, dates to Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 (OIS 4) and shows limited surface preservation so no reliable palaeohydrological estimates could be made. The largest preserved palaeochannel system, the Coocalla unit with a palaeodischarge of ~ 2550 m3s-1, dates to mid OIS 3 (~ 45 - 35 ka), a time of enhanced fluvial activity across the Murray-Darling basin and nearby coastal systems. Two more well preserved palaeochannels, the Kookabunna and Kamilaroi, were both active during OIS 2 (~ 20 &#65533; 15 ka) with discharges of ~ 1240 m3s-1 and ~ 1310 m3s-1, respectively. A period of enhanced aeolian activity has been identified at ~ 4 ka, followed by the establishment of the contemporary system, with a total combined channel capacity mid-fan of ~ 200 m3s-1. The Gwydir fan-plain reveals a Late Quaternary history of flow regime decline by approximately an order of magnitude. The present system of greatly reduced flow competence responds to a marked downstream reduction in discharge with a set of spatial hydraulic geometry and planform changes that are clearly not simply the inverse of more usual systems where discharge increases downstream.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearing Voices</field><field name="creator">Nicholls-Gidley, Linda</field><field name="description">Hearing Voices is a dramatic work intended to explore the use of the Received Pronunciation accent by Australian actors in productions of theatrical classics, particularly Shakespeare, in Australia.

A rift model, involving horst and graben formation, has been invoked to account for the sedimentation patterns in the Late Precambrian to Silurian sequences of the study area. Four phases of extensional (rift) basin development are recognised here, each bounded by a major sequence boundary, with Type I unconformities occurring at the base of: the Rizu Formation; the Dahu Group; the Katkoyeh Formation; and the Shabdjereh and Niur Formations.Deposition of the Late Precambrian Morad Formation was followed by a period of upwarping and erosion giving an unconformable, but locally faulted, boundary with the overlying Rizu Formation. Bimodal volcanism in the lagoonal to lacustrine Rizu Formation indicates the initiation of rifting. The overlying Ravar and Banestan Formations were deposited in marginal to shallow marine conditions. A scarcity of diagnostic fossils precludes precise location of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary in the study area but supratidal to intertidal conditions in the Upper Dolomite Member of the Soltanieh Formation and in the Barut Formation indicate a low stand sea-level in the Early Cambrian. Cambrian strata in the Kerman region, assigned to the Dahu Group (redefined), include the Zaigun Formation, Mohammad Abad Sandstone (new name), Lalun Formation (redefined) and Khoram Abad Sandstone (new name). Lake facies in the Zaigun Formation and fluvial sequences in the Mohammad Abad Sandstone followed extensional tectonic activity and inter-continental basin deposition. Different palaeocurrent trends E and W of the Kuhbanan Fault indicate that this fault was active during deposition. A transgression in the late Early Cambrian formed a ravinement surface at the base of the Lalun Formation overlain by aeolian and beach sandstone. This was followed by supratidal and intertidal facies in the Lalun Formation and a barrier island system in the Khoram Abad Sandstone, indicating progradation and a relatively high sediment input. The Kuhbanan Formation (maximum flooding surface) represents a deeper water facies in the Kerman area in southern Iran than the time equivalent lagoonal facies in the Kalshaneh Formation near Tabas and the supratidal-intertidal facies in Member 1 of the Mila Formation in the Alborz Mountains. Late Cambrian regressive, shallowing-upwards carbonate facies accumulated in the Kerman region, while relatively deeper water facies characterised the Derenjal Formation in the Tabas area and the Mila Formation in the Alborz Mountains.New palaeontological data indicate that the previously poorly defined Cambrian-Ordovician boundary is located in the uppermost carbonate facies of the Derenjal Formation at Dahaneh-eKolut, Tabas area. Intense Early Ordovician subsidence in the Tabas region led to deposition of the thick siliciclastic and carbonate facies of the Tremadoc Shirgesht Formation. compared with the thin carbonate facies of Member 5 of the Mila Formation in the Alborz Mountains. The Katkoyeh Formation is proposed to accommodate the Ordovician of the Kerman area. Where it contains Arenig to Ashgill faunas including the graptolite Dictyonema ghodsiae Rickards et at. 1994; Arenig trilobites are reported for the first time from the Kalmard region from this formation. Pillow basalt of continental origin in the basal Katkoyeh Formation indicates a period of extensional rifting. The Early Arenig transgression of this formation in the Kalmard and Kerman regions, and probably into the Alborz Mountains (Lashkerak formation), may indicate contemporaneous rift development and a high stand sea-level. Transgressive-regressive sequences in the upper Katkoyeh Formation near Kerman indicate sea-level fluctuations.This Early Palaeozoic extensional phase led to deposition of the relatively thick Shabdjereh Formation near Kerman, and terminated in the Early Silurian. The laterally equivalent Niur Formation at Dahaneh-e-Kolut is faulted against the Shirgesht Formation; elsewhere it has a disconforrnable contact with the underlying Cambrian Derenjal Formation Extrusion of pillow basalt in the lower Niur Formation can be traced into the NE Alborz Mountains. A basal red bed sequence containing hyaloclastite facies is described for the first time. and a barrier island system occurs in the lower part of the Niur Formation. Two non-marine horizons and several polymictic conglomerate lenses highlight absence of deep marine facies in the Shabdjereh Formation in the Kerman region.Eustatic sea level changes recorded in the studied sequences are: high stands in the late Early Cambrian and the Early Silurian; a global transgression in the Tremadoc; a further rise in the Arenig; and a regression at the end of the Ordovician.Provenance studies indicate a major cratonic source for the study area in the Early Palaeozoic with periodic detritus from nearby volcanic sources. Throughout the Early Palaeozoic palaeo-relief in the Kerman area was greater than that in the Tabas area.A warm, low latitude climate during the Early Palaeozoic of Iran is indicated by red beds, evaporates, mudcracks, salt and gypsum pseudomorphs, caliche and stromatolites seen to varying degrees throughout the Cambrian-Silurian succession. This contrasts with the glacial deposits in the Late Ordovician-Silurian strata of the Arabian Peninsula.The study area and the Arabian Peninsula have a similar Late Precambrian and Cambrian tectonic style. Different Ordovician and Silurian faunas, palaeoclimates and tectonic conditions distinguish East-Central Iran from Saudi Arabia, but there was a close relationship between Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detecting and resolving redundancies in EP3P policies</field><field name="creator">Salim, Farzad</field><field name="description">Current regulatory requirements on data privacy make it increasingly important for enterprises to be able to verify and audit their compliance with their privacy policies. Traditionally, a privacy policy is written in a natural language. Such policies inherit the potential ambiguity, inconsistency and mis-interpretation of natural text. Hence, formal languages are emerging to allow a precise specification of enforceable privacy policies that can be verified. The EP3P language is one such formal language. An EP3P privacy policy of an enterprise consists of many rules. Given the semantics of the language, there may exist some rules in the ruleset which can never be used, these rules are referred to as redundant rules. Redundancies adversely affect privacy policies in several ways. Firstly, redundant rules reduce the efficiency of operations on privacy policies. Secondly, they may misdirect the policy auditor when determining the outcome of a policy. Therefore, in order to address these deficiencies it is important to identify and resolve redundancies. This thesis introduces the concept of minimal privacy policy - a policy that is free of redundancy. The essential component for maintaining the minimality of privacy policies is to determine the effects of the rules on each other. Hence, redundancy detection and resolution frameworks are proposed. Pair-wise redundancy detection is the central concept in these frameworks and it suggests a pair-wise comparison of the rules in order to detect redundancies. In addition, the thesis introduces a policy management tool that assists policy auditors in performing several operations on an EP3P privacy policy while maintaining its minimality. Formal results comparing alternative notions of redundancy, and how this would affect the tool, are also presented.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade union joining: perceptions from call centre employees</field><field name="creator">Cantrick-Brooks, Bernadine Y</field><field name="description">Declining trade union density in Australia and overseas has been an issue of concern to the trade union movement and some industrial relations researchers. Many reasons have been proposed for this decline at both the macro and micro level, including changes in the structure of the economic base in Australia from manufacturing to services, and an increasingly hostile environment for unions. These issues are explored in a broad survey of the literature on declining union density.Drawing on the author&#8217;s experience in the call centre industry, the thesis uses a marketing research technique to investigate perceptions about unions held by call centre employees. Recruiting members in call centres has proved challenging due to factors such as geographical location of some call centres, anti-union management and a high level of non standard employment in call centres and an increasing tendency to individualism.Viewing the problem from a consumer behaviour perspective, the first issue was to find out what perceptions are held about unions by call centre staff and the second, how do these perceptions influence the union joining decision?Primary research using marketing research tools, Laddering and Means End Chain Analysis, provide a qualitative perspective on the decision making process and the perceptions of unions which underlie the union joining decision. Laddering is the interview technique associated with Means End Chain Analysis. It was developed to elicit the data needed to be analysed using Means End Chain and develop the Hierarchical Value Map.The Hierarchical Value Map indicated the links between the perceived attributes of unions: Powerful, Resources, Troublemaker, Costly and Outmoded and how these were linked to perceived consequences through to the goals or values held by the respondents of: Security, Social Value/Self Esteem, Achievement and Belonging.Factors which were found to affect perceptions were first, whether the respondent was viewing the union joining decision from a collective or individualist perspective, and second, whether they were taking an instrumental, ideological or normative approach to union joining.The use of cross discipline research methods offers further potential for research into trade union density.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shear behaviour of normally consolidated and overconsolidated infilled rock joints under undrained triaxial conditions</field><field name="creator">Mylvaganam, Jayanathan</field><field name="description">Natural rock joints are normally filled with fine materials such as clay and silt which influence entire rock mass stability. Saturated infilled joints have contributed to the instability of rock mass during undrained shearing due to the build up of pore water pressure within the joints. It is probable that most of the discontinuities in nature will be in an overconsolidated or pre-loaded state. The shear response of infilled rock joints is generally controlled by the type and thickness of infill, joint roughness, drainage conditions, and the stress history. Based on the research work carried out at the University of Wollongong in the past, a shear strength model for unfilled and infilled joints was developed using the Fourier functions coupled with energy considerations adopting a hyperbolic technique. It was found that the hyperbolic constants were often sensitive to the types of infill, and the hyperbolic fit was not always accurate for infill such as graphite. In order to predict shear strength more accurately, a conceptual normalised shear strength model was recently developed based on two algebraic functions (Indraratna et al., 2005). Although this model conveniently predicted the shear strength with some accuracy, it required considerable extension to incorporate the degree of overconsolidation in relation to the development of pore water pressure. In this research study, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the effect of overconsolidation on the shear behaviour of saturated infilled joints. For this purpose, the high-pressure two-phase triaxial apparatus at the University of Wollongong was modified with the installation of a mechanical driving system to apply a constant axial strain to shear infilled joints under a given confining pressure. Extensive tests were conducted on saw-toothed (18 degrees asperity angle) joints under consolidated undrained conditions with pore water pressure measurement. Limited tests on planar and sheared sandstone joints were also conducted for comparison. Natural silty clay collected from a rockslide site was used as infill for the entire experimental program. The shear behaviour of saw-toothed joints was investigated for varying infill thickness to asperity height ratios (t/a) in the range of 0-5.0, and varying overconsolidation ratios (1, 2, 4, and 8), at confining pressures of 200 and 500 kPa. Accordingly, a mathematical model is presented for predicting the shear strength of normally consolidated and overconsolidated rough infilled joints. The proposed shear strength model evaluates the reduction in shear strength observed with increasing t/a ratios at varying OCRs. It highlights the role of the critical t/a ratio, beyond which no further reduction in shear strength occurs. This critical t/a divides the infilled joint behaviour into the quote asperity interference unquote and quote asperity non- interference unquote regions. In the region of asperity interference, the sum of two algebraic functions (i.e. An and Bn - represent joint and infill characteristics, respectively for OCR=n) models the decay of shear strength with increasing t/a. In the region of asperity non-interference, the shear strength is modelled purely with infill properties. The proposed model describes how the OCR influences the shear strength, development of pore water pressure, and the critical t/a ratio. This study extends our current understanding of the shear behaviour of infilled rock joints with potential applications in rock engineering such as rock slope stability and underground excavations in jointed rock.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knee function and neuromuscular adaptations following ACL rupture and reconstruction</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Adam L</field><field name="description">In order to alleviate symptoms associated with progressive knee dysfunction and deterioration following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, patients undergo either conservative non-operative rehabilitative regimens or early reconstructive surgery using the patella tendon (PT) or combined semitendinosus and gracilis tendon (STGT) grafts. Following treatment, ACL deficient (ACLD) and ACL reconstructed (ACLR) patients demonstrate varying levels of knee function with compensatory neuromuscular adaptations thought to be responsible for enhancing the dynamic restraint capabilities in more functional patients. Derivation of the neuromuscular factors that estimate participation restrictions could assist clinicians in developing prognoses and outcome measures for ACLD and ACLR patients. Therefore, the main aim of the present thesis was to identify neuromuscular variables, derived during open and closed kinetic chain tasks, that relate to and predict post ACL injury/ACLR functional outcome. To achieve this, 10 male ACLD subjects together with 27 matched-males who had undergone ACLR (14 PT graft and 13 STGT graft) and 22 matched-control subjects were recruited. In Experiment 1, the Cincinnati Knee Rating System was used to assess knee symptoms and limitations associated with activities of daily living and sports. Three single-leg tests designed to replicate athletic activities were also implemented. Subjective and objective scores were combined to provide an overall knee function score for each subject. The ACLD group was significantly more symptomatic and limited in activities of daily living and sports and they also demonstrated impaired jump and hop performance. Whilst the PT and STGT subjects rated significantly higher than their ACLD counterparts, their average subjective and overall knee function scores were significantly lower compared to the control group. Importantly, graft selection did not significantly influence average subjective, objective or overall knee function scores. In Experiment 2, the effect of ACL injury and ACLR on open kinetic chain isokinetic strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings was assessed in 10o intervals through their operational domain. Antagonist activity of the semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles was also determined during knee extension in 10o intervals between 80 and 10o flexion. Conservatively managed subjects demonstrated significant quadriceps and hamstring weakness with involved limb quadriceps strength deficits transferred to the contralateral limb. Harvesting the central one-third of the PT as an ACL substitute did not inhibit quadriceps strength compared those ACL-insufficient knees in which the extensor mechanism was not used in the reconstruction technique (STGT graft). In contrast, harvesting the flexor mechanism for ACLR caused significant hamstring strength deficits that were not apparent in patients having undergone ACLR using the PT graft. Relatively large amounts of hamstring antagonist activity were evident during knee extension, although ST and BF electromyographic discharge was not influenced by ACL status. Hamstring antagonist activity increased and decreased widely as a function of joint angle with the BF significantly more active than the ST in order to control internal tibial rotation. Kinesthetic joint capsule receptors were thought to be the major source dictating hamstring muscle activity in such a manner that it varied nearly inversely relative to its moment arm. In Experiment 3, lower limb kinematics, kinetics and neuromuscular responses were assessed in ACLD and ACLR subjects during a closed kinetic chain task known to stress the ACL, namely abrupt deceleration when landing from a single-leg hop for distance. For the ACLD group, no significant alterations were evident in joint kinematic parameters. Biceps femoris of the involved limb of the ACLD group was activated significantly later compared to the non-involved limb, supporting the notion that after ACL injury, sensory feedback may be used to build a new internal model depicting the expected conditions during functional activities. The involved limb of the ACLD and ACLR groups demonstrated a significant reduction in vertical ground reaction force during the support phase of landing compared to the non-involved limb. Whilst the magnitude of peak tibial acceleration was not significantly different between test limbs or subject groups, it took significantly longer for the involved limb of the ACLD and ACLR groups to attain constant tibial motion compared to the non-involved limb. Subjects having undergone ACLR using the PT graft demonstrated a stiff knee strategy during landing and, whilst the STGT group also demonstrated trends towards decreased knee flexion during landing, no significant kinematic adaptations at the hip, knee or ankle were identified. Decreased knee flexion was found to significantly attenuate the mechanical advantage of the involved limb hamstrings of the ACLD, PT and STGT groups. Cumulative changes in involved limb hip and knee kinematics of the ACLD and ACLR subjects meant that the ST and BF muscles were significantly elongated when decelerating to improve dynamic restraint. Importantly, ACLR led to a restoration of normal quadriceps and hamstring electromyographic (EMG) synchrony in the involved and contralateral limbs and there was no evidence to suggest that the ACLD subjects adopted a pattern of quadriceps-avoidance. In Experiment 4, the strength of the associations among knee functionality of ACLD and ACLR subjects (Experiment 1) and neuromuscular variables derived from open (Experiment 2) and closed (Experiment 3) kinetic chain movements was determined. Numerous significant moderate to strong correlations were identified with determinants of knee functionality related to the type of ACL treatment and graft selection. Compensatory neuromuscular strategies that enhance function in the ACLD knee included amplified hamstring co-activation, increased hamstring preparatory activity and a greater ability to control tibial motion during dynamic deceleration. Following ACL replacement, the degree of residual strength deficit in the muscle from which the tendon graft was harvested (i.e. quadriceps or hamstrings) become an important prognosticator of knee functionality as did attenuated hamstring co-activation during knee extension within the range utilsed during single-limb deceleration. More functional PT subjects demonstrated enhanced tibial control whilst superior knee functionality in STGT subjects was associated with increased preparatory activity of the quadriceps when landing on the involved limb. Furthermore, by synchronising peak hamstring muscle activity at the time when the ACL graft is most vulnerable to injury, more functional STGT subjects enhanced dynamic restraint by increasing joint compression and posterior tibial drawer. By identifying neuromuscular factors that predict function in ACLD and ACLR subjects, the results of these studies will lead to the development of more specific and effective treatment strategies.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of tissue oxygen levels in the ocular lens</field><field name="creator">McNulty, Richard</field><field name="description">Age-related nuclear cataract is a major cause of blindness and is thought to result from oxidation of key cellular  omponents. Molecular oxygen (O2) is a possible oxidant in this process. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the regulation of tissue O2 levels in the ocular lens. We mapped the distribution of O2 within isolated lenses using a fluorescent optode. All lenses examined (bovine, rabbit and human) showed U-shaped Po2 profiles across both the optic and equatorial axes resulting in core hypoxia. When equilibrated in physiological conditions (Po2 environment of 36mmHg), the lens nucleus Po2 was 1.6 &#177; 0.5 mmHg (n=6), 12.5 &#177; 2.5 mmHg (n=6), and 13.8 &#177; 7.6 mmHg (n=24 pairs) in the bovine, rabbit and human lens, respectively.We examined a possible role of Po2 gradients on the development of the embryonic chicken lens. The lens contains two populations of fibre cells, differentiating fibers (DF) in the outer cortex that contain a full complement of organelles (including mitochondria), and mature fibers (MF) in the lens core that do not. Incubating chicken embryos in hyperoxic conditions resulted in larger lenses and an increase in the depth of the DF population compared to lenses from embryos raised in normoxia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxia triggers the elimination of organelles from the lens.The consumption of O2 by the lens was region-dependent. Both respirometric measurements (performed on dissected regions of the bovine lens) and a diffusion/consumption mathematical model showed that approximately 90% of O2 consumption occurred in the cortex, the remainder occurring in the core which contains only MF. The distribution of mitochondria in the DF layer was mapped using 2-photon or confocal microscopy on living lenses treated with mitochondria-specific dyes (rhodamine 123 or Mito Tracker) and in fixed tissue by immunofluorecence using an antibody to cytochrome c-oxidase. The depth of the mitochondria-containing cell layer varied in different species, being 500-760 &#956;m in the bovine lens and 50-100 &#956;m in the human. The Po2 gradients in the lens extended beyond the boundaries of the mitochondria-containing DF layer, consistent with a role for non-mitochondrial O2 consumption (albeit a minor one) in the MF region in the intact lens. We therefore examined both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial processes which may be responsible for modulating lens O2 levels. Mitochondria-inhibition studies showed that the contribution of oxidative phosphorylation to bovine lens QO2 was approximately 90%. Interestingly, mitochondria-inhibiting drugs and age had an insignificant effect on human lens QO2. Ascorbate, found in high levels in the lens, was investigated as an O2 consumer. Bovine and human lens core O2 consumption could be induced by metals and inhibited by the metal-chelator DETAPAC, characteristics which are consistent with ascorbate-dependent O2 consumption. We found no evidence for a role for a trans-plasma membrane oxido-reductase system or photo-oxidation as nonmitochondrial O2 consumers.The movement of O2 through the lens tissue was studied by decreasing lens QO2. Sub-physiological temperatures resulted in a marked decrease in lens QO2 and a concomitant flooding of the lens core with O2. The rapid rise in lens Po2 at lower temperatures may be of clinical relevance. During vitrectomy, cool, O2-rich solutions are infused into the eye. We hypothesise that rising lens core O2 levels during vitrectomy are the cause of the strikingly high incidence of post-vitrectomy nuclear cataract. We have initiated a clinical study to examine whether the use of warmed solutions during surgery can decrease the incidence of post-vitrectomy cataract.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into soil nutrient and change in soil physical characteristics under complementary forage rotation in comparison to pasture systems for dairy cows</field><field name="creator">Kabore, Bertin</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Veterinary Science</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complementary forage rotation, intensive and extensive pastures, nutrient and water use efficiencies, physical properties, forage yield, soil acidification, and runoff water.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of information technology issues in enterprise globalisation</field><field name="creator">Lan, Yi-chen, 1969-</field><field name="description">Domestic companies are increasingly trying to expand to become globalised firms or multinational corporations (MNCs).

Information technology is a critical element in enabling globalisation, and enterprises need to identify and consider information technology and system management issues. Depending on the structure of multinational organisations, different emphases need to be placed on issues such as business information systems management, information technology management, people management, end-user management, and culture.

The study identifies factors that were assisting or hindering the effective implementation of these processes as they existed in 1996. It offers suggestions and recommendations for a future and more effective implementation of these processes. SCOPE This research is qualitative in nature, and uses interview as the main source of data collection. The Catholic schools selected for this study are those that have been involved in the implementation of the first Cycle of the Quality Assurance Processes of the CEO, Sydney. Care was taken to select two schools from each of the three Regions under which the Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Sydney are presently organised. CONCLUSIONS The achievement and maintenance of quality outcomes has always been an integral part of Catholic Education. Through the brief historical background, this study has revealed that leaders in Catholic Education in Sydney have always sought to achieve and maintain quality outcomes since the establishment of the first schools, up until the implementation of the current quality assurance processes. This study found that the current form of Quality Assurance Processes is a most effective means of achieving and maintaining quality outcomes in the present-day Catholic education system. The Processes are professionally articulated in context with current practices, and have the potential to enhance accountability, credibility and development of both the personnel and the schools system. The implementation of the Quality Assurance Processes, to a great degree, has been effective and successful, the present study has shown that, stakeholders are becoming more and more aware of the actual nature and outcomes of these processes. The study also found great optimism among in the key player about the future of the Processes and has concluded that they well received and appreciated across the system. There were a few concerns about the clarity of aims and objectivity, the link between the different processes, and the apparently high and technical terms involved in naming/describing these Processes. The study has, therefore, concluded further that the Processes need streamlining, regular reviews and training programs to strengthen the practice and consolidate the gains and achievement. The implementation of Cycle 2 with appropriate modification is desirable.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality Assurance Processes</field><field name="subject">Catholic education</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Catholic Education Office</field><field name="subject">CEO</field><field name="subject">Archdiocese of Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp212.01092009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New mechanism-based design approaches for spudcan foundations in clay</field><field name="creator">Hossain, Muhammad Shazzad</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Three-legged mobile jack-up rigs supported on spudcan foundations are used to perform most offshore drilling in shallow to moderate water depths, and are now capable of operating in water depths up to 130 m. With the gradual move towards heavier rigs in deeper water, and continuing high accident rates during preloading of the spudcan foundations, appraisal of the performance and safety of jack-up rigs has become increasingly important. A crucial aspect of this is to improve understanding of the mechanisms of soil flow around spudcan foundations undergoing continuous large penetration, and to provide accurate estimates of spudcan penetration resistance, avoiding excessive conservatism. Spudcan foundations undergo progressive penetration during preloading, contrasting with onshore practice where a footing is placed at the base of a pre-excavated hole or trench. However, spudcan penetration is generally assessed within the framework used for onshore foundations, considering the bearing resistance of spudcans pre-placed at different depths within the soil profile. The lack of accurate design approaches that take proper account of the nature of spudcan continuous penetration, which is particularly important in layered soil profiles, is an important factor in the high rate of accidents. ... It was found that when a spudcan penetrated into single layer clay, there were three distinct penetration mechanisms: during initial penetration, soil flow extended upwards to the surface leading to surface heave and formation of a cavity above the spudcan; with further penetration, soil began to flow back gradually onto the top of the spudcan; during deep penetration, soil back-flow continued to occur while the initial cavity remained unchanged. For spudcan penetration in stiff-over-soft clay, four interesting aspects of the soil flow mechanisms were identified: (a) vertically downward motion of the soil and consequent deformation of the layer interface; (b) trapping of the stronger material beneath the spudcan, with this material being carried down into the underlying soft layer; (c) delayed back-flow of soil around the spudcan into the cavity formed above the spudcan; (d) eventual localised flow around the embedded spudcan, surrounded by strong soil. At some stage during continuous spudcan penetration, the soil starts to flow back into the cavity above the spudcan. The resulting back-flow provides a seal above the penetrating spudcan and limits the cavity depth. It was shown that the current offshore design guidelines are based on the wrong criterion for when back-flow occurs. New design charts with robust expressions were developed to estimate the point of back-flow and hence the cavity depth above the installed spudcan. Load-penetration responses were presented in terms of normalised soil properties and geometry factors for both single layer and two-layer clay profiles, taking full account of the observed flow mechanisms. Further, guidelines were suggested to evaluate the likelihood and severity of spudcan punch-through failure in layered clays. Finally, the effect of strain-rate and strain-softening was examined, in an attempt to model real soil behaviour more closely. Adjustment factors were proposed to modify the design approaches developed on the basis of ideal elastic-perfectly plastic soil behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centrifugation</field><field name="subject">Clay</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Foundations</field><field name="subject">Soil-structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Spudcan foundations</field><field name="subject">Centrifuge tests</field><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Soil flow mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Bearing capacity</field><field name="subject">Clays</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming &#8211; Pakeha: questioning the use of native birds in representation as a means of exploring New Zealand post-settler identity in visual art</field><field name="creator">Wilkin-Slaney, Katherine</field><field name="description">The depiction of birds by artists such as Don Binney, Bill Hammond, Michael Parekowhai and Grant Whibley has served as metaphors in the conceptual systems of post-settler New Zealanders&#8217; expression of identity.

Although there is no consensus on the definition of adolescent QOL and what aspects should be measured, it is generally accepted that QOL is a multidimensional construct. Issues related to adolescent QOL bear special considerations since experiences of adolescents are substantially different from those of adults. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding of adolescent QOL by assessing the impact of determinants of QOL over a six-month period. The study will also evaluate the measurement properties of the latent factors underlying adolescent OL based on a second-order confirmatory factor analysis. A recursive structural equation model is then proposed to determine the direction and magnitude of the interdependent effects among the latent factors. The Quality of Life Profile Adolescent Version (QOLPAV), a generic 54-item questionnaire was utilised. It was administered to 251 adolescents without a chronic condition and 112 adolescents with a chronic condition at baseline and the cohort of 204 adolescent without a chronic condition and 96 adolescents with a chronic condition a six months. Stratified sampling was used to recruit the adolescents from high schools in the Perth metropolitan area. Subjects were aged 10 to 19. A non-categorical approach was utilised to recruit adolescents with a chronic condition. To account for the hierarchical effects of the adolescents nested within schools multilevel modelling was undertaken to explore the potential determinants of adolescent QOL perceived in his/her life and the opportunities available were found to be significant predictors for adolescent QOL. However, as expected, health was rated poorer, with more sick days reported by chronically ill adolescents.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of life, adolescents.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=12589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health care challenges and human resources for health in Thailand : migrations, social and political tensions, and human rights implications</field><field name="creator">Thoresen, Stian Ho Yong</field><field name="description">The global shortage of human resources for health and the brain drain of health care professionals exacerbate health care challenges in many small and medium sized economies, including efforts to curb the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This research investigated attitudes, perceptions, and dynamics among health care students and professionals in Thailand related to human resources for health, migration, inequitable distribution between rural and urban areas as well as between the public and private sector, and influences on migration ambitions. This included contemporary social and political parameters. Perceptions and attitudes among health care students and professionals were explored through a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews with health care professionals. Additional interviews with key-informants encapsulated contemporary events, dynamics, adversities, and challenges specific to the Thai context. It is argued that both the right to health care and health care professionals&#8217; right to free movement must be protected and upheld. This research adds to the knowledge and insight into the specific health care challenges in Thailand and reflections upon the sustainability of the health care system; both in light of these health care challenges and the principles of sustainability as proposed by The World Commission on Environment and Development, the Brundtland Report (1990). It will enhance the scope from which health care, manpower expansion, and reform is pursued. Any approach to stem the exodus of health care professionals must recognise the rights of all stakeholders, including health care professionals and health care consumers, and all stakeholders must be engaged in the pursuit of sustainable health care through the principles of sustainable development and global sustainability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of particle-fluid flows in microchannels</field><field name="creator">Chayantrakom, Kittisak</field><field name="description">Flows of fluids and solid particles through microchannels have a very wide range of applications in biological and medical science and engineering.

In particular, partial saturation causes significant attenuation and dispersion due to wave-induced fluid flow. Such flow arises when a passing wave induces different fluid pressures in regions of rock saturated by different fluids. When partial saturation is mesoscopic, i.e. existing on a length scale much greater than pore scale but less than wavelength scale, significant attenuation can arise for frequencies 10-1000 Hz. Models for attenuation and dispersion due to mesoscale heterogeneities mostly assume fluids are distributed in a regular way. Recent experiments indicate mesoscopic heterogeneities have less idealised distributions and distribution affects attenuation/dispersion.

Management aims to restore a fully functional and self-sustaining shrubland community with similar vegetation and resilience properties to that of the surrounding natural vegetation. This thesis examines the performance of the restoration program by Iluka Resources Ltd. (and their predecessors) by comparing current vegetation properties and their response to fires on previously mined land versus the surrounding natural shrubland. As biomass accumulates post-restoration, fires will return as a natural disturbance factor and, as a result, a desirable measure of restoration success might include the ability of the postmined lands to recover from disturbance. Pre-burnt plant species diversity, composition, structure and key functional attributes in four mined sites rehabilitated 8 (R8) to 24 (R24) years ago were compared with those of surrounding natural areas classified on the basis of substrate type (low and high sand dunes, shallow sand swales, sand over laterite and sand over limestone). The rehabilitated sites (except R8) had more species (about 140) than natural sites (about 100) with 12&#8211;37% species in common with natural sites.

SMB technology reduces the cost of packing material with high loading capacity and provides high purity and high recovery in a very short time. Major commodity applications have been found in the petroleum, food, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. The industrial applications bring an emergent demand to improve the SMBCP operation for higher product quality, productivity, efficiency and robustness. However, for this particular process, we encounter several challenges. Firstly, the interplay of the effects of strong nonlinearities, competition of solutes, mass transfer resistance and fluid dynamic dispersion produces steep concentration fronts. Mathematical model accounted for this particular property constitutes a serious difficulty for the solution procedure. Secondly, a dynamic SMB model consists of a set of partial differential, ordinary differential and algebraic equations, which are highly coupled. The large size is a problem due to its intensive computation when on-line optimisation and real-time control are necessary. Thirdly, the SMB unit operation exhibits complex dynamics. Process metrics for design and operation can be determined only when a cyclic steady state is reached after a certain number of switching.

Tunnelling, the transfer of assets and profit for the benefit of controlling owners, is the most important way of expropriating small shareholders. While tunnelling is rampant in emerging economies and even some developed countries, related research lacks convincing evidence. On the other hand, large shareholders sometimes use private funds to prop up firms in financial distress. Although there is plenty of anecdotal and indirect evidence on propping, it lacks direct large-sample examination. This study presents a pooled cross-sectional analysis of 4373 publicly listed companies in China between 2001 and 2004. The analysis not only examines the effects of various variables on the exploitation of related party transactions by controlling owners for tunnelling and propping, and also investigates the effects of tunnelling and propping on firm performance and valuation. The study reveals that the presence of controlling shareholders and higher control rights lead to higher levels of tunnelling. Conversely the existence of other large shareholders reduces the magnitude of tunnelling. In addition, the study shows that pyramidal-controlled firms and firms owned by the State display more incidences of tunnelling. When firms have better investment opportunity, however, their controlling shareholders tend to divert fewer funds for their private gains. It is also found that controlling shareholders offer funds to financially stricken firms under their control. This is the first study that finds direct evidence on the occurrence of propping although not all badly-performing firms are propped up.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tunnelling, shareholders, publicly listed companies, China, propping, firm performance, firm valuation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=118672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shear and bond behaviour of reinforced fly ash-based geopolymer concrete beams</field><field name="creator">Chang, Ee Hui</field><field name="description">Concrete is by far the most widely used construction material worldwide in terms of volume, and so has a huge impact on the environment, with consequences for sustainable development. Portland cement is one of the most energy-intensive materials of construction, and is responsible for some emissions of carbon dioxide &#8212; the main greenhouse gas causing global warming. Efforts are being made in the construction industry to address these by utilising supplementary materials and developing alternative binders in concrete; the application of geopolymer technology is one such alternative. Indeed, geopolymers have emerged as novel engineering materials with considerable promise as binders in the manufacture of concrete. Apart from their known technical attributes, such as superior chemical and mechanical properties, geopolymers also have a smaller greenhouse footprint than Portland cement binders.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction material, sustainable development, environment, Portland cement, carbon dioxide, global warming, geopolymers, reinforced low calcium fly ash-based geopolymer concrete</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=120482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Furan measurement in transformer oil by UV-Vis spectroscopy using fuzzy logic approach</field><field name="creator">Lai, Sin Pin</field><field name="description">An Ultraviolet to Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic analysis based on fuzzy logic approach has been developed for furan content measurement in transformer oil. Following the successful identification and quantification of furan derivatives in transformer oil by ASTM D5837 standard, the new approach is able to approximate the furan content more conveniently and economically. As furan concentration level would determine the absorption intensity in UV-Vis spectral range, the fuzzy logic software model developed would exploit this characteristic to aggregate the furans content level in transformer oil. The UV-Vis spectral response at other ambient temperature is also studied. The proposed technique provides a convenient alternative to conventional method of furan measurement by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) in ASTM D5837 Standard.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultraviolet to visible (UV-Vis), spectroscopic analysis, fuzzy logic approach, furan content measurement, transformer oil, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=128452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the psychological contract in affecting employee behaviour under the influence of merger and acquisition: a study of local regional managers in Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Fong, Dominic</field><field name="description">In past decades, the expectation of synergy has fueled many thousands of mergers and acquisitions.

It results in better nutrition for the infant and to reduced rates of chronic disease later in childhood and adulthood. Breastfed babies have lower rates of infectious diseases and will not be exposed to contaminated infant formula, such as the recent experience with melamine in China. The WHO Expert Consultation on Infant Feeding recommended exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with the introduction of complementary foods and continued breastfeeding thereafter. It was also recommended by the WHO that breastfeeding continue beyond six months for up to two years and beyond. Breastmilk can provide the majority of nutrients for the first 12 months of life.

Domain applications frequently require customers to divulge many personal details about themselves that must be protected carefully in accordance with privacy principles and regulations. Here, we define a privacy ontology to support the provision of privacy and help derive the level of privacy associated with transactions and applications. The privacy ontology provides a framework for developers and service providers to guide and benchmark their applications and systems with regards to the concepts of privacy and the levels and dimensions experienced. Furthermore, it supports users or data subjects with the ability to describe their own privacy requirements and measure them when dealing with other parties that process personal information. The ontology developed captures the knowledge of the domain of privacy and its quality aspects, dimensions and assessment criteria. It is composed of a core ontology, which we call generic privacy ontology and application domain specific extensions, which commit to some of application domain concepts, properties and relationships as well as all of the generic privacy ontology ones. This allows for an evaluation of privacy dimensions in different application domains and we present case studies for two different application domains, namely a restricted B2C e-commerce scenario as well as a restricted hospital scenario from the medical domain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">privacy, domain applications, privacy principles, privacy regulations, ontology, transactions and applications</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=129029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition and assessment of seafloor vegetation using a single beam echosounder</field><field name="creator">Tseng, Yao-Ting</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the potential of using a single beam echosounder as a tool for recognition and assessment of seafloor vegetation.

It is the second leading cause of visual loss globally and while it can occur in all age groups, it is most common in the elderly. The main symptom of glaucoma is the progressive deterioration of the visual field. Management of glaucoma involves careful monitoring of the progress of disease with regular visual field tests. Accurate identification and early intervention can potentially prevent advanced vision loss. A number of mathematical, statistical, and data mining methods have been proposed to identify glaucomatous progression. However, all criteria used to assess change are hampered by noise that arises from individual visual field measurement. In addition, different clinical trials use different definitions of &#8220;progressing&#8221;. Currently there is no standard method for classifying changes in visual field measurements. The purpose of this thesis is to improve existing methods and to develop new methods for classification of glaucoma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaucoma, software, patient's clinical behaviour, age-related visual decline, visual field</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=128516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour and performance of key market players in the US futures markets</field><field name="creator">Gurrib, Muhammad Ikhlaas</field><field name="description">This study gives an insight into the behaviour and performance of large speculators and large hedgers in 29 US futures markets. Using a trading determinant model and priced risk factors such as net positions and sentiment index, results suggest hedgers (speculators) exhibit significant positive feedback trading in 15 (7) markets. Information variables like the S&amp;P500 index dividend yield, corporate yield spread and the three months treasury bill rate were mostly unimportant in large players&#8217; trading decisions. Hedgers had better market timing abilities than speculators in judging the direction of the market in one month. The poor market timing abilities and poor significance of positive feedback results suggest higher trading frequency intervals for speculators. Hedging pressures, which measure the presence of risk premium in futures markets, were insignificant mostly in agricultural markets. As a robust test of hedging pressures, price pressure tests found risk premium to be still significant for silver, crude oil and live cattle. The positive feedback behaviour and negative market timing abilities suggest hedgers in heating oil and Japanese yen destabilize futures prices, and points to a need to check CFTC&#8217;s (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) position limits regulation in these markets. In fact, large hedgers in these two markets are more likely to be leading behaviour, in that they have more absolute net positions than speculators. Alternatively stated, positive feedback hedgers in these two markets are more likely to lead institutions and investors to buy (sell) overpriced (underpriced) contracts, eventually leading to divergence of prices away from fundamentals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speculators, hedgers, US futures markets, CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=117995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water transport due to wick action through concrete</field><field name="creator">Aldred, James M.</field><field name="description">Wick action is the transport of water through a concrete element from a face in contact with water to a drying face as occurs in basements, tunnels, slabs on grade and hollow offshore structures.

Therefore wick action plays an important role in the watertightness and durability of concrete structures.
